1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,270
Being Frank

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:05,129
It wasn't easy, being Frank.

3
00:00:05,129 --> 00:00:09,790
That's what everybody called him, when they
weren't calling him a dirty old tramp or a

4
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:11,840
scrounger or a layabout.

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,280
Frank, they called him.

6
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:19,560
Only the people at the hostel and at the Social
Security bothered with his full name: Francis

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,449
Rossetti Hyslop.

8
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:27,619
Rossetti, he seemed to remember, not after
the painter but after his sister the poet,

9
00:00:27,619 --> 00:00:28,740
Christina.

10
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:34,160
Most often, a person - a person in authority
- would read that name from the piece of paper

11
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:40,300
they were holding and then look up at Frank,
not quite in disbelief, but certainly wondering

12
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,930
how he'd come so low.

13
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:46,660
He couldn't tell them that he was climbing
higher all the time.

14
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:48,579
That he preferred to live out of doors.

15
00:00:48,579 --> 00:00:52,170
That his face was weatherbeaten, not dirty.

16
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:56,640
That a plastic bag was a convenient place
to keep his possessions.

17
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,290
He just nodded and shuffled his feet instead,
the shuffle which had become his trademark.

18
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:06,510
'Here he comes,' his companions would cry.

19
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:09,020
'Here comes The Shuffler!'

20
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:13,840
Alias Frank, alias Francis Rossetti Hyslop.

21
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,869
He spent much of the spring and autumn in
Edinburgh.

22
00:01:16,869 --> 00:01:19,700
Some said he was mad, leaving in the summer
months.

23
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:24,000
That, after all, was when the pickings were
richest.

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,790
But he didn't like to bother the tourists,
and besides, summer was for travelling.

25
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:34,549
He usually walked north, through Fife and
into Kinross or Perthshire, setting up camp

26
00:01:34,549 --> 00:01:37,920
by the side of a loch or up in the hills.

27
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,350
And when he got bored, he'd move on.

28
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:44,939
He was seldom moved on by gamekeepers or the
police.

29
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:46,940
Some of them he knew of old, of course.

30
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:52,939
But others he encountered seemed to regard
him more and more as some rare species, or,

31
00:01:52,939 --> 00:01:57,290
as one had actually said, a 'national monument'.

32
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:59,250
It was true, of course.

33
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:02,650
Tramp meant to walk and that's what tramps
used to do.

34
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:06,450
The term 'gentleman of the road' used to be
accurate.

35
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:11,959
But the tramp was being replaced by the beggar:
young, fit men who didn't move from the city

36
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:15,910
and who were unrelenting in their search for
spare change.

37
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:18,360
That had never been Frank's way.

38
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:23,410
He had his regulars of course, and often he
only had to sit on a bench in The Meadows,

39
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:28,900
a huge grassy plain bordered by tree-lined
paths, and wait for the money to appear in

40
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:31,239
his lap.

41
00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:35,670
That's where he was when he heard the two
men talking.

42
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:40,610
It was a bright day, a lunchtime and there
were few spaces to be had on the meagre supply

43
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:42,880
of Meadows benches.

44
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:48,560
Frank was sitting on one, arms folded, eyes
closed, his legs stretched out in front of

45
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,740
him with one foot crossed over the other.

46
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:56,249
His three carrier bags were on the ground
beside him, and his hat lay across his legs

47
00:02:56,249 --> 00:03:02,590
- not because he was hot especially, but because
you never knew who might drop a coin in while

48
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:06,800
you were dozing, or pretending to doze.

49
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,030
Maybe his was the only bench free.

50
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:12,220
Maybe that's why the men sat down beside him.

51
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:15,150
Well, 'beside him' was an exaggeration.

52
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:21,710
They squeezed themselves onto the furthest
edge of the bench, as far from him as possible.

53
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:26,040
They couldn't be comfortable, squashed up
like that and the thought brought a moment's

54
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,989
smile to Frank's face.

55
00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:33,990
But then they started to talk, not in a whisper
but with voices lowered.

56
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:38,080
The wind, though, swept every word into Frank's
right ear.

57
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,810
He tried not to tense as he listened, but
it was difficult.

58
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:46,270
Tried not to move, but his nerves were jangling.

59
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:48,230
'It's war,' one said.

60
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:51,160
'A council of war.'

61
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,639
War?

62
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:56,040
He remembered reading in a newspaper recently
about terrorists.

63
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,129
Threats.

64
00:03:57,129 --> 00:04:00,159
A politician had said something about vigilance.

65
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,920
Or was it vigilantes?

66
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,880
A council of war: it sounded ominous.

67
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:10,659
Maybe they were teasing him, trying to scare
him from the bench so that they could have

68
00:04:10,659 --> 00:04:12,270
it for themselves.

69
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:14,310
But he didn't think so.

70
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:18,160
They were speaking in undertones; they didn't
think he could hear.

71
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,920
Or maybe they simply knew that it didn't matter
whether an old tramp heard them or not.

72
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,450
Who would believe him?

73
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:28,470
This was especially true in Frank's case.

74
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:31,870
Frank believed that there was a worldwide
conspiracy.

75
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:37,370
He didn't know who was behind it, but he could
see its tentacles stretching out across the

76
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:38,949
globe.

77
00:04:38,949 --> 00:04:41,940
Everything was connected, that was the secret.

78
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:47,310
Wars were connected by arms manufacturers,
the same arms manufacturers who made the guns

79
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:52,160
used in robberies, who made the guns used
by crazy people in America when they went

80
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,090
on the rampage in a shopping-centre or hamburger
restaurant.

81
00:04:56,090 --> 00:05:01,900
So already you had a connection between hamburgers
and dictators.

82
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:05,639
Start from there and the thing just grew and
grew.

83
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:12,270
And because Frank had worked this out, he
wondered from time to time if they were after

84
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,270
him.

85
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:17,669
The dictators, the arms industry, or maybe
even the people who made the buns for the

86
00:05:17,669 --> 00:05:19,610
hamburger chains.

87
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,190
Because he knew.

88
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:24,319
He wasn't crazy; he was sure of that.

89
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:31,680
'If I was,' he told one of his regulars, 'I
wouldn't wonder if I was or not, would I?'

90
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,610
And she'd nodded, agreeing with him.

91
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:36,830
She was a student at the university.

92
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:39,229
A lot of students became regulars.

93
00:05:39,229 --> 00:05:43,570
They lived in Tollcross, Marchmont, Morningside,
and had to pass through The Meadows on their

94
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:46,600
way to the university buildings in George
Square.

95
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,640
She was studying psychology, and she told
Frank something.

96
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:54,540
'You've got what they call an active fantasy
life.'

97
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:56,880
Yes, he knew that.

98
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,440
He made up lots of things, told himself stories.

99
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,600
They whiled away the time.

100
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:08,240
He pretended he'd been an RAF pilot, a spy,
minor royalty, a slave-trader in Africa, a

101
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,880
poet in Paris.

102
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:15,630
But he knew he was making all these stories
up, just as he knew that there really was

103
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:17,410
a conspiracy.

104
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:20,729
And these two men were part of it.

105
00:06:20,729 --> 00:06:23,979
'Rhodes,' one of them was saying now.

106
00:06:23,979 --> 00:06:27,450
A council of war in Rhodes.

107
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:29,740
So there was a Greek connection, too.

108
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,849
Well, that made sense.

109
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:35,160
He remembered stories about the generals and
their junta.

110
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:38,270
The terrorists were using Greece as their
base.

111
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:42,009
And Edinburgh was called the 'Athens of the
north'.

112
00:06:42,009 --> 00:06:43,009
Yes!

113
00:06:43,009 --> 00:06:44,509
Of course!

114
00:06:44,509 --> 00:06:47,009
That's why they were basing themselves in
Edinburgh too.

115
00:06:47,009 --> 00:06:48,830
A symbolic gesture.

116
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:50,360
Had to be.

117
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,500
But who would believe him?

118
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,349
That was the problem, being Frank.

119
00:06:54,349 --> 00:07:01,080
He'd told so many stories in the past, given
the police so much information about the conspiracy,

120
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:05,370
that now they just laughed at him and sent
him on his way.

121
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:08,889
Some of them thought he was looking for a
night in the cells and once or twice they'd

122
00:07:08,889 --> 00:07:11,720
even obliged, despite his protests.

123
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:15,080
No, he didn't want to spend another night
locked up.

124
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,569
There was only one thing for it.

125
00:07:17,569 --> 00:07:21,290
He'd follow the men and see what he could
find.

126
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:23,430
Then he'd wait until tomorrow.

127
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:28,520
They were talking about tomorrow, too, as
if it was the start of their campaign.

128
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:34,419
Well, tomorrow was Sunday and with a bit of
luck if Frank hung around The Meadows, he'd

129
00:07:34,419 --> 00:07:41,349
bump into another of his regulars, one who
might know exactly what to do.

130
00:07:41,349 --> 00:07:44,050
Sunday morning was damp, blustery.

131
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:46,659
Not the sort of day for a constitutional.

132
00:07:46,659 --> 00:07:52,140
This was fine by John Rebus: it meant there'd
be fewer people about on Bruntsfield Links.

133
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:57,300
Fewer men chipping golf-balls towards his
head with a wavering cry of 'Fore!'

134
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,340
Talk about crazy golf!

135
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:03,920
He knew the Links had been used for this purpose
for years and years, but all the same there

136
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:09,470
were so many paths cutting through that it
was a miracle no one had been killed.

137
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:14,389
He walked one circuit of the Links, then headed
as usual across Melville Drive and into The

138
00:08:14,389 --> 00:08:16,220
Meadows.

139
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:18,370
Sometimes he'd stop to watch a kickabout.

140
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:23,669
Other times, he kept his head down and just
walked, hoping for inspiration.

141
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:29,919
Sunday was too close to Monday for his liking
and Monday always meant a backlog of work.

142
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:35,130
Thinking about it never did any good, of course,
but he found himself thinking of little else.

143
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:37,289
'Mr Rebus!'

144
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:42,110
But then The Meadows offered other distractions,
too.

145
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:43,660
'Mr Rebus!'

146
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:45,200
'Hello, Frank.'

147
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,920
'Sit yourself down.'

148
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,220
Rebus lowered himself onto the bench.

149
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:52,910
'You look excited about something.'

150
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:54,290
Frank nodded briskly.

151
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:59,130
Though he was seated, he shuffled his feet
on the earth, making little dance movements.

152
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:02,190
Then he looked around him, as though seeking
interlopers.

153
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:08,070
Oh no, thought Rebus, here we go again.

154
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:10,080
'War,' Frank whispered.

155
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,860
'I heard two men talking about it.'

156
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,230
Rebus sighed.

157
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:19,920
Talking to Frank was like reading one of the
Sunday rags - except sometimes the stories

158
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,780
be told were more believable.

159
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:24,520
Today didn't sound like one of those days.

160
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,670
'Talking about war?

161
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:27,959
Which war?'

162
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:29,980
'Terrorism, Mr Rebus.

163
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,190
Has to be.

164
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:35,390
They've had a council of war at Rhodes.

165
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:36,579
That's in Greece.'

166
00:09:36,579 --> 00:09:39,100
'They were Greek, were they?'

167
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,420
Frank wrinkled his face.

168
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:42,550
'I don't think so.

169
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:45,750
I can give you a description of them though.

170
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:48,800
They were both wearing suits.

171
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:54,980
One was short and bald, the other one was
young, taller, with black hair.'

172
00:09:54,980 --> 00:10:00,390
'You don't often see international terrorists
wearing suits these days, do you?'

173
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:01,649
Rebus commented.

174
00:10:01,649 --> 00:10:06,269
Actually, he thought to himself, that's a
lie: they're becoming more smartly dressed

175
00:10:06,269 --> 00:10:07,329
all the time.

176
00:10:07,329 --> 00:10:11,279
In any case, Frank had an answer ready.

177
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,630
'Need a disguise though, don't they?

178
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:15,970
I followed them.'

179
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:17,530
'Did you?'

180
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:20,010
A kickabout was starting nearby.

181
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:22,050
Rebus concentrated on the kick-off.

182
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:24,450
He liked Frank, but there were times...

183
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:29,100
'They went to a bed and breakfast near the
Links.'

184
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,450
'Did they now?'

185
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:31,560
Rebus nodded slowly.

186
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,920
'And they said it was starting today.

187
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,250
Today, Mr Rebus.'

188
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:39,440
'They don't hang about, do they?

189
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,850
Anything else?'

190
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:42,990
Frank frowned, thinking.

191
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:48,639
'Something about lavatories, or laboratories.

192
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:50,709
Must have been laboratories, mustn't it?

193
00:10:50,709 --> 00:10:53,939
And money, they talked about that.

194
00:10:53,939 --> 00:10:56,720
Money they needed to set it up.

195
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,720
That's about it.'

196
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,660
'Well, thanks for letting me know, Frank.

197
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:04,350
I'll keep my ears open, see if I can hear
any whispers.

198
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:07,220
But listen, don't go following people in future.

199
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:10,740
It could be dangerous, understand?'

200
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,570
Frank appeared to consider this.

201
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:19,560
'I see what you mean,' he said at last, 'but
I'm tougher than I look, Mr Rebus.'

202
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,820
Rebus was standing now.

203
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,430
'Well, I'd better be getting along.'

204
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:25,860
He slipped his hands into his pockets.

205
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:29,040
The right hand emerged again holding a pound
note.

206
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,470
'Here you go, Frank.'

207
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:34,920
He began to hand the money over, then withdrew
it again.

208
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,730
Frank knew what was coming and grinned.

209
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:41,079
'Just one question,' Rebus said, as he always
did.

210
00:11:41,079 --> 00:11:44,680
'Where do you go in the winter?'

211
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,670
It was a question a lot of his cronies asked
him.

212
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:52,959
'Thought you were dead,' they'd say each spring
as he came walking back into their lives.

213
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:58,990
His reply to Rebus was the same as ever: 'Ah,
that would be telling, Mr Rebus.

214
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:00,820
That's my secret.'

215
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:06,010
The money passed from one hand to the other
and Rebus sauntered off towards Jawbone Walk,

216
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:08,570
kicking a stone in front of him.

217
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:13,820
Jawbone because of the whale's jawbone which
made an arch at one end of the path.

218
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,329
Frank knew that.

219
00:12:15,329 --> 00:12:17,079
Frank knew lots of things.

220
00:12:17,079 --> 00:12:20,740
But he knew, too, that Rebus hadn't believed
him.

221
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,100
Well, more fool him.

222
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:28,570
For over a year now they'd played this little
game: where did Frank go in the winter?

223
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:34,380
Frank wasn't sure himself why he didn't just
say, I go to my sister's place in Dunbar.

224
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,699
Maybe because it was the truth.

225
00:12:36,699 --> 00:12:40,339
Maybe because it was a secret.

226
00:12:40,339 --> 00:12:43,630
Rebus looked to him like a man with secrets,
too.

227
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:48,199
Maybe one day Rebus would set out for a walk
and never return home, would just keep on

228
00:12:48,199 --> 00:12:51,360
walking the way Frank himself had done.

229
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,699
What was it the girl student had said?

230
00:12:53,699 --> 00:12:56,899
'Sometimes I think we're all gentlemen of
the road.

231
00:12:56,899 --> 00:13:00,570
It's just that most of us haven't got the
courage to take that first step.'

232
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:05,020
Nonsense: that first step was the easiest.

233
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:09,959
It was the hundredth, the thousandth, the
millionth that was hard.

234
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:15,149
But not as hard as going back, never as hard
as that.

235
00:13:15,149 --> 00:13:19,740
Rebus had counted the steps up to his second-floor
flat many, many times.

236
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:22,110
It always added up to the same number.

237
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:27,050
So how come with the passing years there seemed
to be more?

238
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:29,870
Maybe it was the height of each step that
was changing.

239
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:30,940
Own up, John.

240
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:34,820
For once, own up: it's you that's changing.

241
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:37,290
You're growing older and stiffer.

242
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:42,240
You never used to pause on the first-floor
landing, never used to linger outside Mrs

243
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,459
Cochrane's door, breathing in that smell unique
to blackcurrant bushes and cat-pee.

244
00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:52,990
How could one cat produce that amount of odour?

245
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:58,380
Rebus had seen it many a time: a fat, smug-looking
creature with hard eyes.

246
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:03,089
He'd caught it on his own landing, turning
guiltily to look at him before sprinting for

247
00:14:03,089 --> 00:14:04,970
the next floor up.

248
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:08,089
But it was inside Mrs Cochrane's door just
now.

249
00:14:08,089 --> 00:14:12,970
He could hear it mewling, clawing at the carpet,
desperate to be outside.

250
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:14,380
He wondered.

251
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:16,610
Maybe Mrs Cochrane was ill?

252
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:20,540
He'd noticed that recently her brass nameplate
had become tarnished.

253
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:23,240
She wasn't bothering to polish it any more.

254
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,589
How old was she anyway?

255
00:14:25,589 --> 00:14:29,820
She seemed to have come with the tenement,
almost as if they'd constructed the thing

256
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,590
around her.

257
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:36,800
Mr and Mrs Costello on the top floor had been
here nigh-on twenty-five years, but they said

258
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,490
she'd been here when they arrived.

259
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:41,399
Same brass nameplate on her door.

260
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:44,540
Different cat, of course, and a husband, too.

261
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:51,149
Well, he'd been dead by the time Rebus and
his wife - now ex-wife - had moved here, what,

262
00:14:51,149 --> 00:14:54,020
was it ten years ago now?

263
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,840
Getting old, John.

264
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,230
Getting old.

265
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:02,019
He clamped his left hand onto the bannister
and somehow managed the last flight of steps

266
00:15:02,019 --> 00:15:04,100
to his door.

267
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:09,390
He started a crossword in one of the newspapers,
put some jazz on the hi-fi, drank a pot of

268
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:10,570
tea.

269
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:11,709
Just another Sunday.

270
00:15:11,709 --> 00:15:13,810
Day of rest.

271
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:17,149
But he kept catching glimpses of the week
ahead.

272
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:18,420
No good.

273
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:24,509
He made another pot of tea and this time added
a dollop of J&B to the mixture in his mug.

274
00:15:24,509 --> 00:15:25,680
Better.

275
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,720
And then, naturally, the doorbell rang.

276
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,890
Jehovah's Witnesses.

277
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:34,990
Well, Rebus had an answer ready for them.

278
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:40,410
A friend in the know had said that Roman Catholics
are taught how to counter the persuasive arguments

279
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:42,250
of the JWs.

280
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:45,480
Just tell them you're a Catholic and they'll
go away.

281
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:49,079
'I'm Catholic,' he said.

282
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:50,240
They didn't go away.

283
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,630
There were two of them, dressed in dark suits.

284
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:56,519
The younger one stood a little behind the
older one.

285
00:15:56,519 --> 00:16:00,230
This didn't matter, since he was a good foot
taller than his elder.

286
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:02,139
He was holding a briefcase.

287
00:16:02,139 --> 00:16:05,640
The chief, however, held only a piece of paper.

288
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:09,089
He was frowning, glancing towards this.

289
00:16:09,089 --> 00:16:13,510
He looked at Rebus, sizing him up, then back
to the paper.

290
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:16,360
He didn't appear to have heard what Rebus
said.

291
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:21,029
'I'm Catholic,' Rebus repeated, but hollowly.

292
00:16:21,029 --> 00:16:22,950
The man shook his head.

293
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:26,990
Maybe they were foreign missionaries, come
to convert the heathen.

294
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:29,160
He consulted his scrap of paper again.

295
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:32,640
'I think this is the wrong address,' he said.

296
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:36,329
'There isn't a Mr Bakewell here?'

297
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:37,889
'Bakewell?'

298
00:16:37,889 --> 00:16:39,230
Rebus started to relax.

299
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:42,200
A simple mistake; they weren't JWs.

300
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:45,410
They weren't salesmen or cowboy builders or
tinkers.

301
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:47,889
Simply, they'd got the wrong flat.

302
00:16:47,889 --> 00:16:49,350
'No,' he said.

303
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:50,759
'No Mr Bakewell here.

304
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:52,480
And his tart's not here either.'

305
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,390
Oh, they laughed at that.

306
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:58,209
Laughed louder than Rebus had expected.

307
00:16:58,209 --> 00:17:03,139
They were still laughing as they made their
apologies and started back downstairs.

308
00:17:03,139 --> 00:17:05,939
Rebus watched them until they were out of
sight.

309
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:09,630
He'd stopped laughing almost before they'd
begun.

310
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:14,470
He checked that his keys were in his pocket,
then slammed shut his door - but with himself

311
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:17,240
still out on the landing.

312
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:21,510
Their footsteps sent sibilant echoes up towards
the skylight.

313
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:23,620
What was it about them?

314
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:25,750
If pressed, he couldn't have said.

315
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:29,040
There was just something.

316
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:33,340
The way the smaller, older man had seemed
to weigh him up in a moment, then mentioned

317
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:34,620
Bakewell.

318
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:40,090
The way the younger man had laughed so heartily,
as if it were such a release.

319
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:42,020
A release of what?

320
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:44,440
Tension, obviously.

321
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,950
The footsteps had stopped.

322
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:48,809
Outside Mrs Cochrane's door.

323
00:17:48,809 --> 00:17:54,940
Yes, that was the ting-ting-ting of her antiquated
doorbell, the kind you pulled, tightening

324
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:58,059
and releasing the spring on a bell inside
the door.

325
00:17:58,059 --> 00:18:00,679
The door which was now being pulled open.

326
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:02,400
The older man spoke.

327
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,220
'Mrs Cochrane?'

328
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:07,080
Well, they'd got that name right.

329
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,990
But then it was on her nameplate, wasn't it?

330
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:12,400
Anyone could have guessed at it.

331
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,550
'Aye.'

332
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:18,690
Mrs Cochrane, Rebus knew, was not unique in
making this sound not only questioning but

333
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:19,790
like a whole sentence.

334
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:24,500
Yes, I'm Mrs Cochrane, and who might you be
and what do you want?

335
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,240
'Councillor Waugh.'

336
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,240
Councillor!

337
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:33,120
No, no, there was no problem: Rebus had paid
his Poll Tax, always put his bin-bags out

338
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,090
the night before, never earlier.

339
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:38,260
They might be after Bakewell, but Rebus was
in the clear.

340
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:42,010
'It's about the roadworks.'

341
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:43,010
'Roadworks?'

342
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:44,200
echoed Mrs Cochrane.

343
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,200
Roadworks?

344
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,720
thought Rebus.

345
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,400
'Yes, roadworks.

346
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,250
Digging up the roads.

347
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:52,120
You made a complaint about the roads.

348
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:54,640
I've come to talk to you about it.'

349
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,640
'Roadworks?

350
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,550
Here, you mean?'

351
00:18:57,550 --> 00:19:00,800
He was patient, Rebus had to grant him that.

352
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,140
'That's right, Mrs Cochrane.

353
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:05,380
The road outside.'

354
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:11,830
There was a bit more of this, then they all
went indoors to talk over Mrs Cochrane's grievances'.

355
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:15,090
Rebus opened his own door and went in, too.

356
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:19,740
Then, realising, he slapped his hand against
his head.

357
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:23,600
These were the two men Shuffling Frank had
been talking about!

358
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:31,289
Of course they were, only Frank had misheard:
council of war was Councillor Waugh; Rhodes

359
00:19:31,289 --> 00:19:33,030
was roads.

360
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:34,230
What else had Frank said?

361
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:39,240
Something about money: well, that might be
the money for the repairs.

362
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:43,830
That it was all planned to start on Sunday:
and here they were, on Sunday, ready to talk

363
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:47,190
to the residents about roadworks.

364
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:48,940
What roadworks?

365
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:54,590
The road outside was clear, and Rebus hadn't
heard any gossip concerning work about to

366
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:55,590
start.

367
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:58,690
Something else Frank had heard them say.

368
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:00,950
Lavatories or laboratories.

369
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:06,400
Of course, his own cherished conspiracy theory
had made him plump for 'laboratories', but

370
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,720
what if he'd misheard again?

371
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,549
Where did lavatories fit into the scheme?

372
00:20:11,549 --> 00:20:16,720
And if, as seemed certain, these were the
two men, what was a local councillor doing

373
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,540
staying at a bed and breakfast?

374
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:21,320
Maybe he owned it, of course.

375
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,970
Maybe it was run by his wife.

376
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:27,370
Rebus was a couple of paces further down his
hall when it hit him.

377
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:28,770
He stopped dead.

378
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:31,410
Slow, John, slow.

379
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:33,100
Blame the whisky, maybe.

380
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:37,419
And Jesus, wasn't it so obvious when you thought
of it?

381
00:20:37,419 --> 00:20:43,230
He went back to his door opened it quietly,
and slipped out onto the landing.

382
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:47,000
There was no such thing as silent movement
on an Edinburgh stairwell.

383
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:54,050
The sound of shoe on stone, a sound like sandpaper
at work, was magnified and distorted, bouncing

384
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:57,010
off the walls upwards and downwards.

385
00:20:57,010 --> 00:21:02,650
Rebus slipped off his shoes and left them
on his landing, then started downstairs.

386
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:05,510
He listened outside Mrs Cochrane's door.

387
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:07,909
Muffled voices from the living-room.

388
00:21:07,909 --> 00:21:12,750
The layout of her flat was the same as Rebus's
own: a long hallway off which were half a

389
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:18,750
dozen doors, the last of which - actually
around a corner - led to the living-room.

390
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:21,490
He crouched down and pushed open the letterbox.

391
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:26,100
The cat was just inside the door and it swiped
at him with its paw.

392
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,620
He let the hinge fall back.

393
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:31,080
Then he tried the doorhandle, which turned.

394
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,179
The door opened.

395
00:21:33,179 --> 00:21:36,290
The cat swept past him and down the stairs.

396
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:39,510
Rebus began to feel that the odds were going
his way.

397
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:44,169
The door was open just wide enough to allow
him to squeeze inside.

398
00:21:44,169 --> 00:21:49,210
Open it an inch or two further, he knew, and
it creaked with the almightiest groan.

399
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:51,779
He tiptoed into the hallway.

400
00:21:51,779 --> 00:21:53,980
Councillor Waugh's voice boomed from the living-room.

401
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,450
'Bowel trouble.

402
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:58,740
Terrible in a man so young.'

403
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:04,850
Yes, he'd no doubt be explaining why his assistant
was taking so long in the lavatory: that was

404
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:06,980
the excuse they always made.

405
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:10,380
Well, either that or a drink of water.

406
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:12,080
Rebus passed the toilet.

407
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,940
The door wasn't locked and the tiny closet
was empty.

408
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:19,970
He pushed open the next door along - Mrs Cochrane's
bedroom.

409
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:22,900
The young man was closing the wardrobe doors.

410
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:27,610
'Well,' said Rebus, 'I hope you didn't think
that was the toilet.'

411
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:29,600
The man jerked around.

412
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,600
Rebus filled the doorway.

413
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:35,130
There was no way past him; the only way to
get out was to go through him, and that's

414
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:39,240
what the man tried, charging at the doorway,
head low.

415
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:44,320
Rebus stood back a little, giving himself
room and time, and brought his knee up hard,

416
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:48,580
aiming for the bridge of the nose but finding
mouth instead.

417
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:52,220
Well, it was an imprecise science, wasn't
it?

418
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:57,190
The man flew backwards like a discarded ragdoll
and fell onto the bed.

419
00:22:57,190 --> 00:23:00,549
Flat out, to Rebus's satisfaction.

420
00:23:00,549 --> 00:23:05,150
They'd heard the noise of course, and the
'councillor' was already on his way.

421
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:08,760
But he, too, would need to get past Rebus
to reach the front door.

422
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,620
He stopped short.

423
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:11,890
Rebus nodded slowly.

424
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:14,040
'Very wise,' he said.

425
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:17,100
'Your colleague's going to need some new teeth
when he wakes up.

426
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,530
I'm a police officer by the way.

427
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:23,090
And you, "councillor", are under arrest.'

428
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:25,570
'Arresting the councillor?'

429
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:28,850
This from Mrs Cochrane, who had appeared in
the hall.

430
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:31,670
'He's no more a councillor than I am, Mrs
Cochrane.

431
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:33,040
He's a conman.

432
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,870
His partner's been raking through your bedroom.'

433
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:36,730
'What?'

434
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:38,500
She went to look.

435
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:41,820
'Bakewell,' Rebus said, smiling.

436
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:45,850
They would try the same ruse at every door
where they didn't fancy their chances.

437
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:51,590
Sorry, wrong address, and on to the next potential
sucker until they found someone old enough

438
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:53,850
or gullible enough.

439
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:57,539
Rebus was trying to remember if Mrs Cochrane
had a telephone.

440
00:23:57,539 --> 00:24:00,820
Yes, there was one in her living-room, wasn't
there?

441
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:02,429
He gestured to his prisoner.

442
00:24:02,429 --> 00:24:06,059
'Let's go back into the living-room,' he said.

443
00:24:06,059 --> 00:24:09,030
Rebus could call the station from there...

444
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,950
Mrs Cochrane was back beside him.

445
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:14,510
'Blood on my good quilt,' she muttered.

446
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:17,419
Then she saw that Rebus was in his stocking-soles.

447
00:24:17,419 --> 00:24:20,200
'You'll get chilblains, son,' she said.

448
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,010
'Mark my words.

449
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:24,370
You should take better care of yourself.

450
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:26,090
Living on your own like that.

451
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:28,140
You need somebody to look after you.

452
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:29,840
Mark my words.

453
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,880
He told me he was a councillor.

454
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,200
Would you credit it?

455
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:38,320
And me been wanting to talk to them for ages
about the dogs' mess on the Links.'

456
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,090
'Hello, Shuffler.'

457
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:41,680
'Mr Rebus!

458
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,590
Day off is it?

459
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:47,010
Don't usually see you around here during the
week.'

460
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:50,830
Frank was back on his bench, a newspaper spread
out on his lap.

461
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:52,760
One of yesterday's papers.

462
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:57,820
It contained a story about some black magic
conspiracy in the United States.

463
00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:04,100
Wealthy people, it was reckoned, influential
people, taking part in orgies and rituals.

464
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:08,490
Yes, and the arms manufacturers would be there,
too.

465
00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:11,420
That's how they got to know the politicians
and the bankers.

466
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:12,420
It all connected.

467
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:15,950
'No, I'm off to work in a minute.

468
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:17,799
Just thought I'd stop by.

469
00:25:17,799 --> 00:25:18,880
Here.'

470
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,649
He was holding out a ten-pound note.

471
00:25:22,649 --> 00:25:27,490
Frank looked at it suspiciously, moved his
hand towards it, and took it.

472
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:28,490
What?

473
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:31,140
Didn't Rebus even want to ask him the question?

474
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:33,960
'You were right,' Rebus was saying.

475
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:37,290
'What you told me about those two men, dead
right.

476
00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:39,880
Well, nearly dead right.

477
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,549
Keep your ears open, Frank.

478
00:25:41,549 --> 00:25:45,880
And in future, I'll try to keep my ears open
when you talk to me.'

479
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:52,160
And then he turned and was walking away, back
across the grass towards Marchmont.

480
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,890
Frank stared at the money.

481
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:56,090
Ten pounds.

482
00:25:56,090 --> 00:25:58,460
Enough to finance another long walk.

483
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:00,910
He needed a long walk to clear his head.

484
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:05,610
Now that they'd had the council of war at
Rhodes, the laboratories would be making potions

485
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:07,830
for satanic rituals.

486
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:10,960
They'd put the politicians in a trance, and...

487
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,870
No, no, it didn't bear thinking about.

488
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:18,279
'Mr Rebus!' he called.

489
00:26:18,279 --> 00:26:19,760
'Mr Rebus!

490
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,110
I go to my sister's!

491
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:23,870
She lives in Dunbar!

492
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:25,360
That's where I go in the winter!'

493
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:30,290
But if the distant figure heard him, it made
no sign.

494
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:32,190
Just kept on walking.

495
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:33,930
Frank shuffled his feet.

496
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:39,601
Ten pounds would buy a transistor radio, or
a pair of shoes, a jacket, or a new hat, maybe

497
00:26:39,601 --> 00:26:41,990
a little camping stove.

498
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:46,020
That was the problem with having money: you
ended up with decisions to make.

499
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:50,300
And if you bought anything, where would you
put it?

500
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:55,419
He'd need either to ditch something, or to
start on another carrier-bag.

501
00:26:55,419 --> 00:26:57,910
That was the problem, being Frank.
