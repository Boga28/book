CHAPTER ONE
Confucius - the great Chinese philosopher

00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:07,240
551 BCE-479 BCE

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:11,490
He who learns but does not think is lost.

4
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:17,230
He who thinks but does not learn is in great
danger.

5
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:25,230
Real knowledge is understanding that we actually
know very little.

6
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:26,230
***

7
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:31,410
I was born a very long time ago - the story
of my life was not written down until a long

8
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:37,640
time after my death, so many of the facts
are uncertain.

9
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:42,310
But here I will tell you what was believed
about my life and the events that shaped my

10
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:44,840
thinking.

11
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:54,059
I was born in China in the summer of 551 BCE
- nobody can agree on the exact date and naturally

12
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:57,870
I was too young to remember it myself.

13
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:05,460
I was born in the village of Zou, in the state
of Lu, near present-day Qufu in Shandong Province.

14
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:10,590
My father was from an aristocratic family
of warriors - brave, experienced fighters

15
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:16,320
- and he died when I was three years old.

16
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:23,520
This is not surprising when you know that
he was about forty years older than my mother.

17
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,950
Despite his family background, my father left
us little money - the family had lost their

18
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:33,299
fortune some time before - and we were often
hungry.

19
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:40,750
In Shandong Province, the winters were extremely
cold, and just staying alive was difficult

20
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:42,900
at times.

21
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:48,630
I managed to bring in some money by working
as a shepherd - looking after sheep - and

22
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:56,600
I also took care of a local farmer's cows,
so we did not starve.

23
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:03,340
My mother did her best to educate me and she
taught me many fine lessons about life.

24
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:08,729
The hours I spent with the animals gave me
the chance to think about life and what made

25
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:10,799
it good.

26
00:02:10,799 --> 00:02:17,279
I asked myself about how we should live, what
was fair and unfair and how people should

27
00:02:17,279 --> 00:02:20,569
live together.

28
00:02:20,569 --> 00:02:26,059
As I grew older and became a teenager, these
questions became all the more important to

29
00:02:26,059 --> 00:02:27,290
me.

30
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:33,230
When I was 19 years old, I met a girl called
Qi Guan.

31
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:39,430
Within a short time we had got married and
by the time I was 20, we had started our family.

32
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:46,079
After the birth of our son, King Li, we went
on to have two more children but our marriage

33
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:48,340
was not a happy one.

34
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:58,239
When I was 23, my mother died which affected
me deeply for the next three years.

35
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:02,909
After my mother's death, I started studying
philosophy.

36
00:03:02,909 --> 00:03:10,239
Already, one of my 'life' questions had been
answered - as a family we learnt to understand

37
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:13,209
each other's emotional needs.

38
00:03:13,209 --> 00:03:20,099
However, as I had a wife and children and
all the extra costs that came with a family,

39
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:25,750
I had to make sure that our practical needs
were met as well as our emotional ones.

40
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:29,439
I needed to make some more money.

41
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:35,769
Because I could read and write, and many people
at that time could not, I found a job as a

42
00:03:35,769 --> 00:03:44,870
clerk - keeping records and doing the accounts
- for the Duke of Lu, the ruler of the state.

43
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:52,169
Lu was a powerful man who spent every day
making decisions about other people's lives.

44
00:03:52,169 --> 00:03:58,109
Some people thought he was fair while others
felt that he was against them.

45
00:03:58,109 --> 00:04:03,559
According to the way each person had been
treated, I saw happiness, sadness and anger

46
00:04:03,559 --> 00:04:06,909
in their faces.

47
00:04:06,909 --> 00:04:12,499
Understanding how much we are affected by
the things that people say and do, I developed

48
00:04:12,499 --> 00:04:21,900
my Golden Rule - you should not do to others
what you would not like them to do to you.

49
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:28,539
Each day at work, watching how people made
decisions, I formed my views.

50
00:04:28,539 --> 00:04:34,050
The solutions to the questions that I asked
myself were tried and tested each day and

51
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:36,460
people came to respect me.

52
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:46,909
I enjoyed working hard and I tried to be reliable,
both of which were noted, and I was promoted.

53
00:04:46,909 --> 00:04:47,909
***

54
00:04:47,909 --> 00:04:53,849
I lived during what became known as the Spring
and Autumn Period in Chinese history.

55
00:04:53,849 --> 00:05:00,610
The country consisted of many small states
that were constantly fighting for power.

56
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:05,800
Chinese society was going through many changes
as traditional values were challenged.

57
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:13,129
There was tension and stress all around me
and I wanted to find a way in which we could

58
00:05:13,129 --> 00:05:18,870
live in harmony - a state of peaceful cooperation.

59
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:25,139
I had very clear views on how people should
behave towards each other.

60
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:31,060
Everyone had a specific place in society and
according to where they fitted in, they had

61
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:37,349
different roles to play and had different
duties that they were responsible for.

62
00:05:37,349 --> 00:05:42,699
Taking this a step further, I believed that
there were five different types of relationships

63
00:05:42,699 --> 00:05:44,840
in the world.

64
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:52,650
The first was between ruler and subject - the
person living under the authority of the ruler.

65
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:55,879
The second was that between father and son.

66
00:05:55,879 --> 00:06:00,430
The third was between elder brother and younger
brother.

67
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:09,560
The fourth was between husband and wife, and
the last was between friend and friend.

68
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:16,520
Apart from the last type, all the others involved
one person having authority over another.

69
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:22,249
The person who was not in the superior position
of authority had to obey and respect the person

70
00:06:22,249 --> 00:06:29,460
who was, and the one with all the power had
a duty to be responsible for and kind to the

71
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:30,460
other.

72
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:36,479
In my language, I called this duty to be a
loving person ren.

73
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:37,479
***

74
00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:46,300
In 518 BCE, I left my job and spent my time
reading and teaching.

75
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:54,389
My aim was to encourage and motivate my students,
not just to tell them what was right and wrong.

76
00:06:54,389 --> 00:07:01,281
It didn't matter to me who my students were
or what social class they belonged to, I just

77
00:07:01,281 --> 00:07:04,319
loved teaching.

78
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:13,210
This was unusual because at that time, education
was something only the rich had access to.

79
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:18,159
My approach seemed to be popular because it
wasn't long before I had a large number of

80
00:07:18,159 --> 00:07:24,659
followers - people who supported me and believed
in what I was saying.

81
00:07:24,659 --> 00:07:30,800
I decided to travel to the imperial capital
of China, Lo-yang, so that I could learn about

82
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,160
the customs and traditions of the empire.

83
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:44,599
Then, in 517 BCE, when I had come back, the
state of Lu was involved in war and I left

84
00:07:44,599 --> 00:07:52,930
again, along with the Duke of Lu, and went
to a neighbouring state called Qi.

85
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:55,259
Here I learnt about music.

86
00:07:55,259 --> 00:08:01,500
The next period of my life was spent with
my followers and I was also a teacher.

87
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:09,039
At the age of 51 in 500 BCE, I became the
Justice Minister of the state.

88
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:14,870
This was a job that required balance between
the law and politics and I saw myself not

89
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:19,849
as an inventor of the law but a messenger
of it.

90
00:08:19,849 --> 00:08:25,590
In each case I listened to, all the facts
had to be collected, and then interpreted

91
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:27,930
and applied.

92
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:35,610
I believed that having a moral viewpoint,
rather than just following the law, was vital.

93
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:38,690
People would ask me if we needed laws.

94
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:43,570
My answer was that if people always behaved
well to each other, then that would be enough,

95
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:47,670
and no, it was not necessary to have laws.

96
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:55,320
But people can be greedy and unfair, wanting
more than their fair share, in which case,

97
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:59,630
society cannot function without laws.

98
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:06,180
Another one of my beliefs was that we should
appreciate our ancestors because without them

99
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,899
we would not be here.

100
00:09:08,899 --> 00:09:14,930
I thought that it was vital to show respect
for our living elders and family members,

101
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:19,120
because without them, we would be alone.

102
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:24,910
For me, the basis of a strong community was
helping others, in the hope that they would

103
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:28,269
help you in return.

104
00:09:28,269 --> 00:09:37,460
Life is a series of choices, choices which
can benefit some people and disadvantage others.

105
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:44,780
But it can be difficult to put the needs of
others before the things we ourselves want.

106
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:53,199
I believed that one of the keys to happiness
was to understand other people and their needs.

107
00:09:53,199 --> 00:10:01,840
Another key was to be virtuous and by that,
I mean behaving in an honest and moral way.

108
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:10,230
However, it is much easier to be virtuous
in thought than it is in practice.

109
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:15,790
For example, nobody wants to find themselves
in the position where they may lose other

110
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:18,290
people's respect.

111
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:23,300
This may happen if you make a stupid mistake.

112
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:30,560
To avoid looking stupid, we sometimes try
to hide the mistake we made and in the process

113
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,930
we make more mistakes.

114
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:40,620
I always thought that it was better to be
honest and admit making the first mistake.

115
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:47,660
In this way, not only do we avoid making the
original situation worse, but also we can

116
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:54,300
learn and improve, and make fewer mistakes
in the future.

117
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:59,940
But to do this, you have to get to know yourself.

118
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:06,460
Knowing yourself is the first step in understanding
other people.

119
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:11,640
Without this first step, you will not be able
to live with other people in a calm and pleasant

120
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:14,720
way.

121
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:20,670
As well as asking me about the necessity of
laws, people around me were curious about

122
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:22,550
religion.

123
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:26,900
Did we need to have religion in our lives,
they asked me.

124
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:32,310
My answer was that I did not find religion
logical.

125
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:39,019
All religions have ideas of what is good and
bad, and often the religious rules as to what

126
00:11:39,019 --> 00:11:45,440
is allowed and what is not allowed are not
flexible enough.

127
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:51,589
Society changes but these rules stay the same.

128
00:11:51,589 --> 00:11:58,509
Another aspect of religion that I had difficulty
with was the existence of a god.

129
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:06,000
Was it possible that there was one god only,
and that this god had all the answers?

130
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,300
I doubted it very much.

131
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:15,190
What I didn't doubt was the need for some
kind of belief system, but I didn't know what

132
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:16,880
form it should take.

133
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:22,899
In contrast, I truly believed in democracy.

134
00:12:22,899 --> 00:12:29,730
At any one time, there can only be one ruler
but it should be the people who decide who

135
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:32,329
is going to govern.

136
00:12:32,329 --> 00:12:39,920
Cruel and unfair rulers can then be removed
from power.

137
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:47,320
I saw leadership as being a gift, not an absolute
right, and I believed that the person given

138
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:52,360
the honour of ruling should be a virtuous
person at all times.

139
00:12:52,360 --> 00:13:00,279
If they do not behave in a correct, ethical
way, then people will rebel and choose a new

140
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:02,639
leader.

141
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:08,990
I knew that this system would work well in
a small place where everyone knew each other,

142
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:14,690
but I was not sure if it could be applied
to somewhere much larger.

143
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:20,329
How could a ruler communicate his beliefs
and rules in an area where great distances

144
00:13:20,329 --> 00:13:23,160
had to be covered?

145
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:28,209
If his word was not widely known, how could
it be supported?

146
00:13:28,209 --> 00:13:35,290
If a leader was not supported, he could not
be respected, and without respect, his future

147
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:37,330
was at risk.

148
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:44,959
Virtue, for me, was the all-important characteristic
for a leader.

149
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:51,149
If people were ruled by laws and were punished
when they broke them, they would try to avoid

150
00:13:51,149 --> 00:13:55,720
the punishment but would not change their
behaviour.

151
00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:03,110
However, if a ruler was a virtuous person
and ruled by example, that is, by always behaving

152
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:10,260
in a moral and ethical way, then people would
change their 'bad' behaviour and would start

153
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:16,180
to be virtuous, too, without needing to be
punished.

154
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:22,570
I stayed in my position as Minister of Justice
in the state of Qi for four years and in that

155
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:29,839
time, I was promoted to Prime Minister, but
due to serious political disagreements, in

156
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:36,329
495 BCE I decided to leave both my job and
the state of Qi.

157
00:14:36,329 --> 00:14:43,750
I travelled, going from one region to another,
always in the company of my followers.

158
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:49,620
I talked to people wherever I went, hoping
that some of my principles would be adopted

159
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:51,720
by them.

160
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:57,639
I was especially hopeful that rulers would
lead their people based on a system of virtue,

161
00:14:57,639 --> 00:15:01,860
but I did not see many examples of this.

162
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:10,569
In 483 BCE, I returned to the state of Lu
and continued my teaching.

163
00:15:10,569 --> 00:15:17,639
In 479 BCE, when I was 72, I died.

164
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:24,750
My followers treated me as if I had been their
father, and as was the custom at the time,

165
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:28,339
mourned me for three years.

166
00:15:28,339 --> 00:15:33,769
After my death, my followers started to write
down some of my theories and they produced

167
00:15:33,769 --> 00:15:38,310
a publication now known as the Analects.

168
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:43,680
My beliefs could now be taught by others to
later generations of students.

169
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,199
In this way, the philosophical school of thought,
Confucianism, was born.

170
00:15:46,199 --> 00:15:47,199
The Life of Confucius

171
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,199
551 BCE Confucius was born in the village
of Zou in the Chinese state of Lu, near present-day

172
00:15:48,199 --> 00:15:49,199
Qufu, Shandong Province.

173
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:50,199
548 BCE When Confucius was three, his father
died.

174
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:51,199
He was raised by his mother, in poverty.

175
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:52,199
532 BCE Aged 19, he married Qi Guan and they
had a son and two daughters.

176
00:15:52,199 --> 00:15:53,199
He worked as a shepherd, cowherd, clerk and
book keeper.

177
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:54,199
Due to his ability to read and write, he secured
a job with the Duke of Lu, as a clerk.

178
00:15:54,199 --> 00:15:55,199
528 BCE His mother died and he spent the next
three years in mourning.

179
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:56,199
During that time, he studied philosophy.

180
00:15:56,199 --> 00:15:57,199
He wanted to create harmony among people in
his home country of China which was in conflict

181
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:58,199
and fighting many wars.

182
00:15:58,199 --> 00:15:59,199
519 BCE Confucius began teaching ancient customs.

183
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:00,199
His teachings were based upon moral and ethical
principles for day-to-day living.

184
00:16:00,199 --> 00:16:01,199
He believed that there were five different
relationships in the world.

185
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:02,199
518 BCE He travelled to the imperial capital,
Lo-yang, and studied the traditions of the

186
00:16:02,199 --> 00:16:03,199
empire.

187
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:04,199
517 BCE When there was war in the state of
Lu, the Duke of Lu and Confucius escaped to

188
00:16:04,199 --> 00:16:05,199
the neighbouring state of Qi.

189
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:06,199
Confucius learned the art of music.

190
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:07,199
500 BCE At the age of 51, he was appointed
as the Minister of Justice of the state of

191
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:08,199
Lu.

192
00:16:08,199 --> 00:16:09,199
He was promoted to Prime Minister.

193
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:10,199
495 BCE Confucius left the state of Lu and
his position in the government.

194
00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:11,199
He spent the following years travelling from
one region to another hoping to put his principles

195
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:12,199
into practice.

196
00:16:12,199 --> 00:16:13,199
483 BCE He returned to the state of Lu and
refused any offer of a Government position.

197
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:14,199
479 BCE Confucius died aged 72, in the state
of Lu.

198
00:16:14,199 --> 00:16:15,199
CHAPTER TWO
Socrates - the great Greek philosopher

199
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:16,199
c.470 BCE-399 BCE

200
00:16:16,199 --> 00:16:17,199
My greatest belief and one that guided me
my whole life, was a simple one.

201
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:18,199
If you have a problem and want to find the
solution that is right for you, you have to

202
00:16:18,199 --> 00:16:19,199
make sure you ask the right questions.

203
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,199
***

204
00:16:20,199 --> 00:16:23,790
I was born in the city of Athens, Greece in
470 BCE.

205
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:29,839
My father, Sophroniscus, was a stonemason
- someone who cuts stone for building work

206
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:36,709
- and sculptor and my mother, Phaenarete,
was a midwife.

207
00:16:36,709 --> 00:16:41,910
As you can imagine, we were not wealthy and
we lived a simple life.

208
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:48,069
I had the most basic education and then when
I had finished school, my father taught me

209
00:16:48,069 --> 00:16:49,529
his trade.

210
00:16:49,529 --> 00:16:54,500
I also learned a great deal by watching him
as he worked.

211
00:16:54,500 --> 00:17:02,020
Being a practical man, my father let his hands,
rather than his mouth, do the talking.

212
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:07,841
I trained myself to pay attention to detail
and I tried to be a good apprentice, working

213
00:17:07,841 --> 00:17:09,980
hard.

214
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:14,770
Even though I tried, I was not very interested
in becoming a stonemason.

215
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:20,720
My real passion was listening to the stories
the elders in our village told.

216
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:27,710
Each day, I would hear these wise old men
sharing their views with whoever would listen.

217
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:33,080
They talked about what they knew, and their
opinions differed depending on how they saw

218
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,460
life.

219
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:40,430
They would discuss problems of the present,
such as how our way of life could be improved.

220
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:45,770
They would look at examples from the past
to help them reach conclusions.

221
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:51,320
Ideas for the future were also considered,
for example, whether new laws should be introduced

222
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:56,570
to improve society and if so, which ones.

223
00:17:56,570 --> 00:18:03,210
Apart from practical issues, they also discussed
more abstract topics, such as whether truth

224
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:06,590
and certainty actually existed.

225
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:11,300
Each would try to convince the others that
their view was the correct one.

226
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:16,100
Those who were respected for their attitude
and contributions - for they were not all

227
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:20,940
judged equally - usually had the most success.

228
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:25,870
To me, these debates were at the centre of
reality.

229
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:31,370
Unlike the lifeless stone and wood that I
worked with every day, people were warm and

230
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:34,290
alive and were capable of thought.

231
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:39,420
I believed that it was our duty to share and
compare what was in our minds in order to

232
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:43,040
improve and develop as human beings.

233
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:49,410
This and only this would lead to happiness
and a contented, rich life.

234
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:55,180
I had seen that wealthy people were not necessarily
happier than the rest of us.

235
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:59,110
I had noticed that there are times in our
lives when difficult decisions have to be

236
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:04,330
made and we don't know which direction to
take to get the best result.

237
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:07,870
Let me explain what I mean.

238
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:14,270
From an early age I had seen people - my mother
is a good example - worry about areas of their

239
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:18,350
lives that they thought were problematic.

240
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:22,460
As with all families, we had plenty of disagreements.

241
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:27,460
My mother found it difficult to keep the peace
and be fair at the same time.

242
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:33,600
At times I am sure that I was responsible
for making her upset and angry but often she

243
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,320
didn't ask me why I was behaving badly.

244
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:42,730
Instead, she would decide for herself what
was troubling me and would act accordingly.

245
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:50,640
She wasn't always right and I discovered how
important it was to share thoughts and ideas.

246
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,640
***

247
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:57,690
In 431 BCE, the Peloponnesian War between
Athens and Sparta began.

248
00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:01,930
I was a soldier at the time, doing my military
service.

249
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:06,760
In the heat of battle there was little time
for debate and sharing one's thoughts - differences

250
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:12,570
were settled by fighting - but having a set
of principles did help to guide me.

251
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:15,520
I tried to be brave and fearless.

252
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,330
People later told me that I was.

253
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:24,180
I was lucky enough to be able to save the
life of an Athenian general called Alcibiades,

254
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:29,870
who was respected and well-liked in Athens.

255
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:36,460
Greek society in the 4th century BCE was divided
up into cities, each functioning as a state

256
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:39,200
with its own government and rules.

257
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:44,090
It was normal for them all to be in conflict
with each other, but there was an alternative

258
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:50,970
way of dealing with such conflicts - a great
competition that we called the Olympic Games.

259
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:57,030
The original Olympics were held in honour
of Zeus, who, according to Greek mythology,

260
00:20:57,030 --> 00:21:02,190
was one of the twelve gods who lived in the
temple of the gods at Mount Olympus.

261
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:06,870
Zeus was the father and king of the gods.

262
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:12,580
In the town of Olympia a huge, impressive
statue of him was built and Greeks from all

263
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:15,380
over the country came to see it.

264
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:19,080
It was here that the Games were first held.

265
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:24,900
All the Greek city states sent representatives
to compete in the games.

266
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:29,650
Everyone taking part had to swear an oath
to the king of the gods, and had to be able

267
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:32,080
to speak Greek.

268
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:37,320
It was important not only for the athletes
to compete in sporting competitions, but also

269
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:44,350
to participate in the many theatre, poetry,
sculpture, dance and singing events that were

270
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:45,350
held.

271
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:51,020
The Games were the perfect occasion for everyone
to celebrate their culture, their religion

272
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:54,480
and their artistic talents.

273
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:59,590
In the beginning, the sporting competitions
were open to both men and women, with the

274
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:05,720
women taking part in a series of races called
the Heraean Games, dedicated to the goddess

275
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,880
Hera.

276
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:13,350
Later on, however, women were excluded from
competing and then were not even allowed to

277
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:15,820
enter the stadium.

278
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:21,450
Eventually this rule was relaxed and women
were permitted to compete in equestrian events,

279
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:24,820
that is, those involving horses.

280
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:30,620
A Spartan princess called Cynisca, driving
a four-horse chariot, was the first woman

281
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:34,640
to become an Olympic winner.

282
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:45,250
In contrast, the first male Olympic champion
was a man called Coroebus, a cook who won

283
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:51,550
the first running event which covered the
distance of 192 metres.

284
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:58,020
For the men, there was a variety of events,
all designed to test mental and physical strength

285
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:01,110
as well as endurance.

286
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:06,480
It was a rule that athletes had to train for
at least ten months before the Games.

287
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,520
Winners did not get medals.

288
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:13,960
Instead, they were given a crown made from
leaves, called a laurel wreath.

289
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:18,310
They were also given a branch from an olive
tree.

290
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:24,120
As well as becoming a valued sporting event,
the ancient Olympic Games became a great social

291
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:26,320
occasion, too.

292
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:31,750
People from the city states who were not athletes
would meet to share ideas and do business

293
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:37,250
and in this way the Games helped develop Greek
culture and way of life.

294
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:45,190
But, of course, real life was not just about
taking part in sporting and cultural events,

295
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:48,220
nor was it about being polite to each other.

296
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:55,120
Politics, too, had its place and where there
was politics, there was also conflict, caused

297
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:59,130
by various types of bad behaviour.

298
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:04,920
People tried to dominate each other; they
tried to cheat each other; and they were jealous,

299
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:10,280
wanting what their neighbours had and they
did not.

300
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:15,760
I had become interested in philosophy, and
I was wondering about how social conditions

301
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:21,570
could be improved, for example, how could
we avoid injustice?

302
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:27,860
I developed a method of investigation which
people later called the Socratic Method.

303
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:34,000
It consisted of my asking people, both rich
and poor, questions based on political and

304
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,280
ethical issues.

305
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:44,230
The topics covered, among other things, courage,
love and respect, and the way people saw themselves.

306
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:49,000
I questioned anyone I found out and about
in the city streets and I didn't care whether

307
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,030
they were willing or not to talk to me.

308
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:57,740
I must have developed a particular style because
young people would copy the way I talked.

309
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:03,220
From people's answers I intended to create
what I saw as being 'truths'.

310
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:08,650
I would have the evidence I needed to state
that I had more than just a theory.

311
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:14,950
I would then use my evidence to try and make
a better world and better living conditions.

312
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:19,980
But finding real evidence could be difficult
because people didn't always want to answer

313
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,850
my questions.

314
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:26,300
When they did answer, they were often not
truthful.

315
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:31,330
I believed that those who were reluctant to
give answers were those who had something

316
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:32,880
to hide.

317
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:39,700
I soon discovered that it was the honest people
who had no problem with telling the truth.

318
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:45,460
I also believed that for the better world
I was looking for to exist, politics had to

319
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:48,720
be conducted in a honest way.

320
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,220
That came back to people again.

321
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:56,340
The government worked best when it was ruled
by individuals who had the greatest ability

322
00:25:56,340 --> 00:26:02,230
and knowledge, and possessed a complete understanding
of themselves.

323
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:08,050
The only way to achieve this understanding
was to ask the right questions and answer

324
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:11,950
them truthfully.

325
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:17,770
When I was 50, after I had spent many years
on my work, I met a woman many years younger

326
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:26,280
than me, called Xanthippe and in 419 BCE we
became husband and wife.

327
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:32,540
We had three children, all boys, and although
I would like to say our family life was happy,

328
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:33,760
it was not.

329
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:38,370
Xanthippe always felt that I did not pay enough
attention to her and the boys.

330
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:44,240
I am afraid that she may have been right.

331
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,240
***

332
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:52,160
In 404 BCE, after 25 years of conflict and
fighting, Athens had been finally defeated

333
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:56,190
in the last battle of the Peloponnesian War.

334
00:26:56,190 --> 00:27:02,480
The city was now going through a period of
instability and its people were feeling insecure.

335
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:07,770
They did not wish to let go of their memories
of successful battles, their ideas of wealth

336
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:11,000
and their obsession with physical beauty.

337
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:16,250
Good looks were seen as being incredibly important
for anyone wanting to be successful in the

338
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:19,730
world of politics.

339
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:24,670
For a long time, beauty and the idea of goodness
had been linked.

340
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:30,080
If you were not handsome, people thought you
could not be a good person either.

341
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:35,010
My own appearance did not help me as I could
not have been described as being good-looking

342
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:39,590
by anyone, probably not even my own mother.

343
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:43,770
Nor was I interested in money and what it
could buy.

344
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:48,800
This was probably a good thing as I was always
rather poor.

345
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:54,240
I did not try to look like a successful man
by wearing good clothes or by trying to look

346
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,190
clean and tidy.

347
00:27:56,190 --> 00:28:02,850
I tried to convince society that it was the
mind that was of the greatest importance.

348
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:08,500
Unfortunately many people felt threatened
by what was, in their view, an attack on their

349
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,220
way of life.

350
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:16,280
I tried to use humour while I was challenging
their conventional wisdom but I was not always

351
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:23,480
very successful and I managed to upset both
politicians and the military.

352
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:30,460
A military government called the Thirty Tyrants
took control of the city and they ruled for

353
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:32,730
about a year.

354
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:38,540
During that time, I became even more unpopular
with the authorities.

355
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:43,710
On one occasion a man had been sentenced to
death and I thought the way he had been judged

356
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:44,980
was unfair.

357
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:52,030
I objected, as I was not the kind of man who
kept quiet about social injustice.

358
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:57,080
Once again, speaking my mind led to some dangerous
situations.

359
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:05,750
However, my message must have had some influence
because in 406 BCE I was invited to be a member

360
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:06,750
of the Boule.

361
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:11,350
The Boule was a council made up of city residents.

362
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:18,590
It dealt with matters such as property disagreements
and access to the facilities in the city.

363
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:24,270
For the council to be successful, it had to
be fair and make decisions that people could

364
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:27,650
accept, but there were often problems.

365
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:32,280
Other members of society who were not part
of the council wanted things to happen their

366
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,570
way.

367
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:39,970
They knew that money was a powerful tool and
they used it to get what they wanted.

368
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:44,570
Justice was replaced by corruption, something
that I found unacceptable.

369
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:51,120
I protested, with the result that I made more
enemies.

370
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:57,280
I had not stopped using my method of asking
questions to find solutions, but the questions

371
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:00,960
that I asked those in power gave offence.

372
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:06,980
The truth was often inconvenient, for if they
answered truthfully, they would expose themselves

373
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:09,790
as being dishonest or corrupt.

374
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:17,690
Still, I did not give up and with every question
I raised, the political temperature also rose.

375
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:23,340
I have to admit that I quite enjoyed seeing
these people arguing.

376
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:27,760
At least they were talking about what was
right and wrong.

377
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:35,720
As it turned out, though, they were also talking
about me and what was to be done with me.

378
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:45,140
During 399 BCE, a message arrived saying that
I was going to be arrested.

379
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:50,380
Friends advised me to escape but to me that
was to admit defeat.

380
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:55,540
I had always thought that running away from
a problem was no answer.

381
00:30:55,540 --> 00:31:02,400
The right thing to do was to face my accusers,
so that's what I did.

382
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,820
There were many of them.

383
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:09,880
A jury of 500 Athenian men were gathered to
judge me.

384
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:14,290
At that time, religion was a serious thing
in Athens.

385
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:20,120
There were many religious festivals that people,
by law, had to take part in.

386
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:25,560
The many temples and shrines - the places
where people went to pray and worship - were

387
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:28,160
cared for with public money.

388
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:33,320
Showing religious disrespect was a serious
crime.

389
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:38,860
My accusers claimed that I did not believe
in the Athenian gods, but worshipped gods

390
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:40,880
of my own.

391
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:46,940
They believed that my attitude was dangerous
and that my views were corrupting young people,

392
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:51,280
who were also behaving in a disrespectful
way.

393
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:55,080
Others accused me of interfering with progress.

394
00:31:55,080 --> 00:32:00,880
Few people openly said what really scared
them but I knew what it was.

395
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:07,160
I was the voice of the poor people, the majority
of citizens who could not vote and could not

396
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,010
be heard.

397
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:13,270
What would happen if I was allowed to become
their political champion?

398
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:16,070
Would there be a revolution?

399
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:17,500
Would we win?

400
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:21,100
That was the real fear!

401
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:26,380
Realizing the danger of allowing me to be
free, the majority of the powerful 500 had

402
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:31,440
their way, and I was found guilty of being
a revolutionary.

403
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:41,350
I was imprisoned, but I was not a murderer
or a thief I was really guilty of two things,

404
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:45,560
neither of which I considered to be a crime.

405
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:53,830
One was searching for truth and the other
was trying to abolish inequality from society.

406
00:32:53,830 --> 00:33:05,790
I was sentenced to death by poison, which
1 drank myself.

407
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:12,000
The end of my life, however, was not the end
of the search for justice and truth, and it

408
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,750
certainly did not stop my ideas from taking
on a life of their own.

409
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:25,940
I like to think that my principles of ethics
and morality had considerable influence on

410
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:27,680
the development of scientific thought.

411
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,680
The Life of Socrates

412
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,680
470 BCE Socrates was born in Athens.

413
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,680
He was the son of Sophroniscus, an Athenian
stone-mason, and Phaenarete, a midwife.

414
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,680
Socrates learnt his father's trade at a young
age.

415
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,680
His interests were in ideas and later he focused
on education and philosophy.

416
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,680
459 BCE Socrates gained a basic education
and through his curiosity, he began to learn

417
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,680
about the customs and culture of Athens.

418
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,680
449 BCE He was probably working in his father's
business at this time.

419
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,680
439 BCE Socrates was developing his philosophy,
based on asking questions about social life.

420
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:37,680
These covered issues such as what is justice
and what is goodness.

421
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,680
435 BCE About that time, Socrates developed
the view that the best way to a happy life

422
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,680
is to focus on self-development, rather than
chase after wealth.

423
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,680
Building relationships came before making
money.

424
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,680
431 BCE The Peloponnesian War began (Athens
v. Sparta).

425
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,680
Socrates participated in three military campaigns
during the war, at Potidaea, Deliurn and Amphipolis,

426
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,680
as a soldier.

427
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,680
He saved the life of Alcibiades, a popular
Athenian general.

428
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,680
Socrates was known for his courage and fearlessness
in battle.

429
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,680
425 BCE Socrates continued to raise questions
about social life and may have earned his

430
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,680
living as a teacher.

431
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,680
418 BCE Socrates fought in the Battle of Mantinea.

432
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,680
419 BCE At the age of 50, Socrates married
Xanthippe, who was much younger.

433
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,680
They had three sons: Lamprocles, Sophroniscus
and Menexenus.

434
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,680
412 BCE Socrates had the opportunity to try
out his theories and ideas, as a parent.

435
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,680
He continued to make speeches and attract
the interest of the poor people and the youth,

436
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,680
as well as annoying some politicians and military
people.

437
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,680
404 BCE The Peloponnesian War ended.

438
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,680
Athenians entered into a period of instability
and doubt about their identity.

439
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,680
Socrates was critical of leaders who had failed
in the war.

440
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:57,680
406 BCE Socrates was a member of the governing
organization called the Boule.

441
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,680
407 BCE He met Plato and shared his ideas.

442
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,680
Plato wrote up his memory of the meetings,
which served as a record, as there was no

443
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,680
direct evidence of Socrates writing a book
of his philosophy or psychology.

444
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,680
400 BCE Socrates called himself a philosopher
and social critic.

445
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,680
Many people listened to his criticism of the
politicians and military leaders.

446
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,680
He was seen by some as a revolutionary, who
encouraged the ambitions of the poor.

447
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,680
399 BCE Socrates was sentenced to death for
being a revolutionary.

448
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,680
It was said that he worshipped new gods of
his own and not the Greek gods and that he

449
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,680
was encouraging young people to do the same.

450
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,680
CHAPTER THREE
Aristotle - the first man to organize scientific

451
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,680
knowledge
384-322 BCE

452
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:09,680
If you ask people to mention the names of
three great philosophers, my name will come

453
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:10,680
up along with those of Socrates and Plato.

454
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:11,680
People also remember me because Alexander
the Great was my most famous student.

455
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:12,680
***

456
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:13,680
I was born in 384 BCE in Macedonia in the
north of Greece in a town called Stagira,

457
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:14,680
which was a busy port.

458
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:16,490
Nowadays, many tourists want to see the place
that is famous because it was my birthplace.

459
00:34:16,490 --> 00:34:21,829
There isn't much left of the old town, just
ruins, but people enjoy seeing part of the

460
00:34:21,829 --> 00:34:27,159
wall that surrounded the town, some of the
old houses in it and the market place - the

461
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:29,020
Agora.

462
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:33,909
This was the most important part of the town
because it was here that people went to do

463
00:34:33,909 --> 00:34:39,760
business, talk politics and of course socialize.

464
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:45,190
I was lucky enough to have parents who taught
me many things, but you could also say that

465
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:53,319
I was rather unlucky, too, because they both
died when I was just a boy.

466
00:34:53,319 --> 00:34:59,349
My father, whose name was Nicomachus, was
a doctor but he wasn't an ordinary doctor.

467
00:34:59,349 --> 00:35:03,759
He was the personal physician to King Amyntas
of Macedonia.

468
00:35:03,759 --> 00:35:08,190
It was my father who made me interested in
learning about medicine.

469
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:13,500
Naturally we didn't really know very much
about how the human body worked, nor did we

470
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:16,180
know exactly what caused people to become
ill.

471
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:22,809
When they were sick, we tried to cure their
illnesses with herbs and prayers.

472
00:35:22,809 --> 00:35:28,119
What we did understand, however, was that
keeping fit by taking regular exercise was

473
00:35:28,119 --> 00:35:30,619
extremely important.

474
00:35:30,619 --> 00:35:38,369
We saw that those who were fit got ill less
often than those who never exercised at all.

475
00:35:38,369 --> 00:35:41,490
Medicine wasn't the only subject I was interested
in.

476
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:47,650
By nature, I was a curious child and, from
an early age, I listened with great interest

477
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:51,440
to the family discussions that often took
place at home.

478
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:56,420
These debates - because they were more than
just discussions - were about the political

479
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:58,380
situation in our town.

480
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:04,069
They focused on the activities of all the
influential people who lived there.

481
00:36:04,069 --> 00:36:08,559
I don't know whether or not it was my father's
wish for me to become a politician.

482
00:36:08,559 --> 00:36:16,779
Unfortunately, he died long before I knew
myself what I wanted to do with my life.

483
00:36:16,779 --> 00:36:22,390
When my father died, leaving me an orphan,
my older sister Arimneste and her husband

484
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:25,960
Proxenus took me in and looked after me.

485
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:31,119
My father had been a wealthy man and there
was plenty of money available for my education.

486
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:37,849
In addition to my existing interest in politics
and medicine, what I was really fascinated

487
00:36:37,849 --> 00:36:41,800
by was philosophy and science.

488
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:47,019
Not only did I want to continue my studies
in these subjects but I also wanted to study

489
00:36:47,019 --> 00:36:51,789
in the city that was the most important academic
place on the planet.

490
00:36:51,789 --> 00:37:04,150
So in 366 BCE, at the age of eighteen, I packed
up and moved to Athens.

491
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:05,150
***

492
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:07,640
Athens was a completely new world for me.

493
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:12,740
My first impression was of all these city
people rushing noisily through the streets

494
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:14,299
trying to make their fortune.

495
00:37:14,299 --> 00:37:19,600
They were so busy in their attempts to make
money that very few of them actually had the

496
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:25,160
time to discover new things and explore the
world around them.

497
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:30,980
This, however, was exactly what I intended
to do with my time.

498
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:36,460
Having come from an aristocratic family, I
had enough money to follow my dream and to

499
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:37,730
live comfortably.

500
00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:43,190
In Athens, I joined Plato's Academy.

501
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:48,839
Plato was a great thinker and teacher and
I learnt a great deal from him.

502
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:54,329
For the next twenty years, until his death,
I worked at the Academy.

503
00:37:54,329 --> 00:38:01,170
It was the perfect chance to research and
teach and I focused on the 'science of living'

504
00:38:01,170 --> 00:38:08,940
which included politics, physics, logic, biology
and psychology.

505
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:14,259
In one sense, original thought was easier
in my time because there was so much that

506
00:38:14,259 --> 00:38:16,089
we didn't know.

507
00:38:16,089 --> 00:38:21,910
We could research a subject, and with the
results, we could expand and develop what

508
00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:25,160
we already knew about it.

509
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:34,130
When Plato died in 347 BCE, many people believed
that I would become the new director of the

510
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:38,730
Academy, but I was not offered the position.

511
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:44,660
Before his death, Plato had requested that
it would be his nephew, not I, who would inherit

512
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:47,349
the position.

513
00:38:47,349 --> 00:38:55,160
During our time together Plato and I had had
many academic differences and it was inevitable

514
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:58,359
that we would disagree sometimes.

515
00:38:58,359 --> 00:39:05,240
Perhaps his decision was based on these differences,
perhaps not, but anyway, I decided instead

516
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:07,810
to travel.

517
00:39:07,810 --> 00:39:12,150
Travelling was hard work and took a long time
on dangerous rough roads.

518
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:16,910
I walked, or rode on horses or camels, whatever
the weather.

519
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:24,859
In the summer, it was hot and dusty; in the
winter, I froze in the snow, ice and fierce

520
00:39:24,859 --> 00:39:25,859
winds.

521
00:39:25,859 --> 00:39:29,740
In autumn and spring, I got very wet when
it rained.

522
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:35,330
Of course, every season had its spectacular
moments but there was no doubt that however

523
00:39:35,330 --> 00:39:40,240
rich you were, travelling was uncomfortable.

524
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:45,630
When I finally reached Assos in Asia Minor,
I visited an ex-student of mine, Hermias,

525
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:48,630
who had once been a slave.

526
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:54,509
As well as gaining his freedom, he had managed,
surprisingly, to become King of Atarneus.

527
00:39:54,509 --> 00:39:58,800
I stayed with Hermias's family for three years
and met his niece, Pythias.

528
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:05,589
We fell in love and got married.

529
00:40:05,589 --> 00:40:10,930
I was already a happy man, but one of the
best days of my life was when little Pythias,

530
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:14,849
our daughter, was born.

531
00:40:14,849 --> 00:40:15,849
***

532
00:40:15,849 --> 00:40:22,170
In 343 BCE King Philip II, whose son would
become Alexander the Great, invited me back

533
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:28,190
to Macedonia to educate the thirteen-year-old
boy, and there I became the head of the Royal

534
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:30,030
Academy.

535
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:37,990
I taught Alexander and a few of his friends
philosophy, poetry, drama, science and politics.

536
00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:44,920
Alexander dreamed of being a hero on the battlefields
and, when he was 16, he took part in his first

537
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:45,920
battle.

538
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:53,490
Two years after that, he helped his father
to defeat armies from both Athens and Thebes.

539
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:58,089
King Philip II was head of the Corinthian
League and he managed to get all the Greek

540
00:40:58,089 --> 00:41:03,759
city states, with the exception of Sparta,
to agree to belong to it.

541
00:41:03,759 --> 00:41:11,640
When Philip died in 336 BCE, Alexander became
King of Macedonia, but being King did not

542
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:14,990
give him the right to be the leader of the
League.

543
00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:20,749
Athens was being ruled by Dimosthenis, whose
aim was to control the League himself.

544
00:41:20,749 --> 00:41:25,529
Alexander sent his army south and persuaded
the members of the League to accept him as

545
00:41:25,529 --> 00:41:27,660
their leader.

546
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:28,660
***

547
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:35,230
In 334 BCE, while Alexander was fighting for
control of Asia, I decided to return to the

548
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:39,109
city with my family.

549
00:41:39,109 --> 00:41:44,250
I still wanted to teach and I was given permission
to open my own school, at the edge of the

550
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:47,529
city, which we called the Lyceum.

551
00:41:47,529 --> 00:41:52,140
I gathered together a group of research students
who became known as the 'peripatetics'.

552
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:57,410
Their name was based on the Greek for 'walking'
because of their habit of wandering around

553
00:41:57,410 --> 00:42:01,920
the school while they were thinking and discussing
different topics.

554
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:07,420
I wanted education to be available for everyone
and so many of our lectures were open to the

555
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:10,680
public and were free of charge.

556
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:15,640
It was in this school of mine that my type
of thinking was given a name: 'Aristotelian

557
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:23,039
logic', the key aspect of which was clarity
of thought, and here I wrote, among many others,

558
00:42:23,039 --> 00:42:30,720
two of my better known books: De Anima and
Parva Naturalia.

559
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:33,089
Academic life wasn't easy.

560
00:42:33,089 --> 00:42:39,630
We worked by the light of candles which was
hard on the eyes, and it was often cold.

561
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:43,940
It wasn't only at the Lyceum where conditions
were difficult.

562
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:49,130
Poverty and disease surrounded us and tragically,
because we did not have enough knowledge of

563
00:42:49,130 --> 00:43:00,570
medicine to save her, my poor wife died in
335 BCE at a very young age.

564
00:43:00,570 --> 00:43:05,349
I was sure that we wouldn't have lost her
if our level of education had been higher

565
00:43:05,349 --> 00:43:10,000
and we'd been able to carry out proper scientific
research.

566
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
***

567
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:18,471
Education, in my view, consisted of three
parts and to be thorough and correct, had

568
00:43:18,471 --> 00:43:26,049
to include all three: the practical, the poetical
and the theoretical.

569
00:43:26,049 --> 00:43:31,470
The practical covered politics and ethics
in government and business, the poetical was

570
00:43:31,470 --> 00:43:37,109
concerned with the arts and humanities, while
the theoretical was all about mathematics

571
00:43:37,109 --> 00:43:38,740
and metaphysics.

572
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:44,499
The scientific method that I was in favour
of provided a link between the three areas,

573
00:43:44,499 --> 00:43:50,950
but I was convinced that evidence, rather
than just opinion, had to be the basis for

574
00:43:50,950 --> 00:43:51,950
assessment.

575
00:43:51,950 --> 00:43:56,619
The problem with evidence, however, was that
it was proving hard to find for many of my

576
00:43:56,619 --> 00:43:59,309
theories.

577
00:43:59,309 --> 00:44:04,470
Before I returned to Athens and set up the
Lyceum, I had gone to the island of Lesbos

578
00:44:04,470 --> 00:44:09,000
for a while in the hope of finding such evidence.

579
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,369
I wanted to study natural life in its natural
form.

580
00:44:12,369 --> 00:44:19,349
In the sea, marine life provided new understanding
and I was completely fascinated by botany

581
00:44:19,349 --> 00:44:22,470
- the study of plants.

582
00:44:22,470 --> 00:44:27,349
I knew that plants had secrets that could
bring help to those who were ill.

583
00:44:27,349 --> 00:44:32,609
I had learnt that much from my father, but
I was sure that there was still so much more

584
00:44:32,609 --> 00:44:34,090
to be discovered.

585
00:44:34,090 --> 00:44:39,710
In the field of agriculture, too, we had to
find better ways of growing crops so that

586
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:44,760
we could become more efficient at feeding
ourselves.

587
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:50,660
In contrast, I believed that because the study
of ethics is a personal subject, the best

588
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:54,740
way to learn about it was through life experience.

589
00:44:54,740 --> 00:45:00,840
By 'life experience' I mean learning by thinking
about the decisions we make and the things

590
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:02,509
that we do.

591
00:45:02,509 --> 00:45:06,080
This means studying our thoughts as they are
acted out.

592
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:11,440
Politics, however, is a public matter.

593
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:14,609
People in general use politics to survive.

594
00:45:14,609 --> 00:45:20,950
It is all about using your skills to negotiate
who gets what, when and how.

595
00:45:20,950 --> 00:45:25,619
Depending on how good you are at politics,
the results will either be positive with peace

596
00:45:25,619 --> 00:45:33,160
and prosperity all around you, or negative,
leading to a state of conflict and revolution.

597
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:38,950
Philosophy became a key area of my thought
and teaching as I tried to find a way to integrate

598
00:45:38,950 --> 00:45:41,789
logic, feelings and evidence.

599
00:45:41,789 --> 00:45:47,630
Later, much of my approach was adopted and
turned into what was called Scholasticism

600
00:45:47,630 --> 00:45:50,999
and some of my ideas were kept alive.

601
00:45:50,999 --> 00:45:56,609
In a world where time destroys almost everything,
my life's work has survived.

602
00:45:56,609 --> 00:46:02,691
Not only has it survived, it is now better
known than it was when I was alive, although

603
00:46:02,691 --> 00:46:04,519
it did disappear for a while.

604
00:46:04,519 --> 00:46:11,140
In about 1500 CE, after hundreds of years
in a world where science was forgotten, my

605
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:16,849
work suddenly came to life again as universities
began to teach Greek.

606
00:46:16,849 --> 00:46:20,490
My work became visible and important once
more.

607
00:46:20,490 --> 00:46:25,130
However, much of what I suggested then was
guesswork.

608
00:46:25,130 --> 00:46:30,520
My claim that the earth was the centre of
the universe took more than 2,000 years to

609
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:32,740
be proved.

610
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:38,329
Theory is fine, but scientific evidence is
hard to establish because it requires clear

611
00:46:38,329 --> 00:46:42,779
thinking and the strength not to give up.

612
00:46:42,779 --> 00:46:46,960
Theories are ideas that mark the way for change
and development.

613
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:53,069
To get evidence, experiments need to be made
and we need to learn from our actions.

614
00:46:53,069 --> 00:46:59,650
We need more people to face the challenge
of the unknown, people who will advance understanding,

615
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:03,339
despite the ignorance of others.

616
00:47:03,339 --> 00:47:08,779
Innovation takes time to succeed, and it seems
to be a fact that having evidence by itself

617
00:47:08,779 --> 00:47:09,839
is not enough.

618
00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:14,569
It is also necessary to have a quick mind
and make good judgments.

619
00:47:14,569 --> 00:47:19,809
You need to be able to publicize your ideas
and have the confidence to tell the whole

620
00:47:19,809 --> 00:47:23,910
world about them and make people believe in
you.

621
00:47:23,910 --> 00:47:28,010
Only in this way can people move forward.

622
00:47:28,010 --> 00:47:37,839
In 323 BCE, Alexander the Great died and the
Macedonian government lost power.

623
00:47:37,839 --> 00:47:44,869
In Athens there were considerable anti-Macedonian
feelings and I felt that my life was in danger.

624
00:47:44,869 --> 00:47:48,999
I made the decision to leave the city and
to go to the island of Euboea.

625
00:47:48,999 --> 00:47:49,999
A year later I died there of natural causes.

626
00:47:49,999 --> 00:47:50,999
The Life of Aristotle

627
00:47:50,999 --> 00:47:51,999
384 BCE Aristotle was born in Stagira, Chalcidice,
near Thessaloniki, Greece.

628
00:47:51,999 --> 00:47:52,999
The name Aristotle means 'the best purpose'.

629
00:47:52,999 --> 00:47:53,999
366 BCE He was sent to Plato's Academy in
Athens to study.

630
00:47:53,999 --> 00:47:54,999
347 BCE Plato died and Aristotle left Athens
for Assos, Asia Minor.

631
00:47:54,999 --> 00:47:55,999
There he met a former student, Hermias, and
later married Hermias' niece, Pythias.

632
00:47:55,999 --> 00:47:56,999
They had one daughter, who they also named
Pythias.

633
00:47:56,999 --> 00:47:57,999
344 BCE Aristotle lived on the island of Lesbos
for some time where he carried out botanical

634
00:47:57,999 --> 00:47:58,999
research.

635
00:47:58,999 --> 00:47:59,999
343 BCE Philip II of Macedonia invited Aristotle
to tutor his son, Alexander (the Great) and

636
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:00,999
he was appointed as head of the Royal Academy
there.

637
00:48:00,999 --> 00:48:01,999
334 BCE He returned to Athens and established
his own school, called the Lyceum.

638
00:48:01,999 --> 00:48:02,999
335-323 BCE His wife Pythias died and he then
became involved with Herpyllis, with whom

639
00:48:02,999 --> 00:48:03,999
he had a son that he named after his father,
Nicomachus.

640
00:48:03,999 --> 00:48:04,999
During these years, he wrote many of his works
including De Anima and Parva Naturalia.

641
00:48:04,999 --> 00:48:05,999
323 BCE Alexander the Great died and anti-Macedonian
feelings increased in Athens.

642
00:48:05,999 --> 00:48:06,999
Fearing a death sentence, Aristotle escaped
to the island of Euboea.

643
00:48:06,999 --> 00:48:07,999
322 BCE Aristotle died of natural causes,
aged 61 or 62, on Euboea.

644
00:48:07,999 --> 00:48:08,999
CHAPTER FOUR
William Wilberforce - the man who ended the

645
00:48:08,999 --> 00:48:09,999
British slave trade
1759-1833

646
00:48:09,999 --> 00:48:12,230
Freedom, slavery and Christianity - these
were the words that had the biggest impact

647
00:48:12,230 --> 00:48:13,650
on my life.

648
00:48:13,650 --> 00:48:19,670
They began to influence my thinking and action
as soon as I became mature enough to understand

649
00:48:19,670 --> 00:48:24,200
their true meaning.

650
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:25,200
***

651
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:30,609
I was born in 1759 in the town of Hull, in
the north of England.

652
00:48:30,609 --> 00:48:34,779
My father was a rich merchant and we lived
a comfortable life.

653
00:48:34,779 --> 00:48:41,569
My parents were religious people, Christians,
who often mentioned the word slavery.

654
00:48:41,569 --> 00:48:48,130
Of course, as a child it didn't really mean
much to me, nor did the concept of freedom.

655
00:48:48,130 --> 00:48:53,880
I only knew that my own freedom to play and
join in games with other boys was limited

656
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:58,359
by my poor eyesight and bad health.

657
00:48:58,359 --> 00:49:02,019
When I was nine years old, my father died.

658
00:49:02,019 --> 00:49:07,299
My mother's grief was deep and resulted in
her not being able to look after me, so I

659
00:49:07,299 --> 00:49:13,470
was sent south to London to live with my aunt
and uncle.

660
00:49:13,470 --> 00:49:18,559
Religion to them was more than going to church
and praying, and they worked to end poverty

661
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:21,079
and slavery.

662
00:49:21,079 --> 00:49:26,220
After a while, when my mother had recovered
from my father's death, I returned home.

663
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:31,599
However, I had been influenced by my time
with my relatives in London and their views

664
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:34,519
on life stayed with me.

665
00:49:34,519 --> 00:49:39,730
I was lucky having had a privileged upbringing
but I realized that most people did not share

666
00:49:39,730 --> 00:49:41,779
my luck.

667
00:49:41,779 --> 00:49:47,140
When I was seventeen, I went to St John's
College, Cambridge University.

668
00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:53,059
I had inherited money from different relatives,
so with money of my own I was financially

669
00:49:53,059 --> 00:49:55,380
independent.

670
00:49:55,380 --> 00:50:00,710
This meant that I could do what I wanted and
enjoy student life to the full.

671
00:50:00,710 --> 00:50:06,039
I experienced a world of luxury that most
people at the time could only dream about

672
00:50:06,039 --> 00:50:11,800
while all around me there was poverty and
misery.

673
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:17,980
I lived in an academic world where there was
a lot of talking and very little action.

674
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:23,440
Talking about the real world and the difficulties
most people were facing was not enough for

675
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:24,440
me.

676
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:31,240
I knew that with my wealth, education and
contacts, I could make a difference.

677
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:38,809
My friend, William Pitt, who later became
Prime Minister, suggested that I enter Parliament.

678
00:50:38,809 --> 00:50:44,140
He knew a lot of influential people and introduced
me to political life.

679
00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:49,489
I managed to get elected - using eight thousand
pounds of my own money undoubtedly helped

680
00:50:49,489 --> 00:50:57,030
- and in 1780 I became a Member of Parliament
for Kingston-upon-Hull while I was still a

681
00:50:57,030 --> 00:50:58,030
student.

682
00:50:58,030 --> 00:51:02,750
I decided not to join a political party but
to be an Independent.

683
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:07,809
In that way, I could lead rather than follow
- I didn't want the restrictions that belonging

684
00:51:07,809 --> 00:51:09,819
to a party would involve.

685
00:51:09,819 --> 00:51:14,720
I had money, and with money it was possible
to have influence.

686
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:19,839
It was also possible to have a very enjoyable
social life.

687
00:51:19,839 --> 00:51:24,230
In the evenings, I went to various gentlemen's
clubs.

688
00:51:24,230 --> 00:51:29,599
These were clubs where upper-class men would
meet their friends, enjoy expensive dinners,

689
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:32,029
and gamble.

690
00:51:32,029 --> 00:51:36,430
Some said that I was clever with words, a
talent that certainly helped me when speaking

691
00:51:36,430 --> 00:51:38,580
in Parliament.

692
00:51:38,580 --> 00:51:43,200
So my life as a wealthy politician began.

693
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:50,210
It was a pleasant type of existence and while
on a tour of Europe in 1785, I continued enjoying

694
00:51:50,210 --> 00:51:54,489
the privileged kind of life that money could
buy.

695
00:51:54,489 --> 00:51:56,869
But something had started to worry me.

696
00:51:56,869 --> 00:52:02,999
I began to question why, when Britain was
a relatively rich country, there were very

697
00:52:02,999 --> 00:52:06,069
poor people in every town and city.

698
00:52:06,069 --> 00:52:12,410
There were people who were living in the most
desperate poverty.

699
00:52:12,410 --> 00:52:17,770
The upper classes, however, were not only
living well, but were increasing their wealth,

700
00:52:17,770 --> 00:52:22,589
for example by renting out land and property
to the poor.

701
00:52:22,589 --> 00:52:29,160
My interest in spiritual matters grew and
I started asking myself what sort of a life

702
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:31,599
I should be leading.

703
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:37,880
To find answers, I read the Bible and I realized
that there was a better way.

704
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:42,930
I wanted to share my beliefs and make other
people think in the same way.

705
00:52:42,930 --> 00:52:48,989
Naturally, this affected my politics but I
was doubtful if this was a good thing.

706
00:52:48,989 --> 00:52:55,640
Would people take seriously a politician who
was as deeply religious as I was?

707
00:52:55,640 --> 00:53:01,880
I asked William Pitt, who by this time was
Prime Minister, for advice, and he encouraged

708
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:06,670
me to continue and to act on what I believed
in.

709
00:53:06,670 --> 00:53:12,410
One of these beliefs was that slavery was
wrong.

710
00:53:12,410 --> 00:53:18,390
The British slave trade began in the 16th
century when Britain began to acquire territories

711
00:53:18,390 --> 00:53:21,489
to add to its Empire.

712
00:53:21,489 --> 00:53:26,040
Colonists started farming the land and they
needed workers.

713
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:31,299
In the beginning, they hired people but as
the farms grew larger, they needed more people

714
00:53:31,299 --> 00:53:33,280
than were available.

715
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:39,390
In the British territories in North America,
American Indians weren't suitable because

716
00:53:39,390 --> 00:53:45,710
they easily caught diseases the Europeans
had brought with them like pneumonia and tuberculosis

717
00:53:45,710 --> 00:53:49,529
and they usually died as a result.

718
00:53:49,529 --> 00:53:55,750
The Portuguese and Spanish were already using
slaves from Africa in their own colonies and

719
00:53:55,750 --> 00:53:59,670
so the British decided to do the same.

720
00:53:59,670 --> 00:54:04,660
Most of the British slave trade was centred
in the West Indies - a group of islands in

721
00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:08,359
the Caribbean - which was part of the British
Empire.

722
00:54:08,359 --> 00:54:13,339
The main crop on the plantations was sugar,
which was sent to Britain and other places

723
00:54:13,339 --> 00:54:15,739
in the Empire.

724
00:54:15,739 --> 00:54:21,559
The money that came from the plantations was
invested by the owners in other types of industry

725
00:54:21,559 --> 00:54:28,569
such as banking and insurance, and Britain's
economy became partly dependent on the slave

726
00:54:28,569 --> 00:54:30,380
trade.

727
00:54:30,380 --> 00:54:35,069
Slaves were not only a valuable source of
income for the slave traders, they were also

728
00:54:35,069 --> 00:54:39,420
the main reason the plantations were so profitable.

729
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:44,859
The owners did not have to pay wages and by
encouraging female slaves to have children,

730
00:54:44,859 --> 00:54:50,099
there were future generations of workers born
into slavery.

731
00:54:50,099 --> 00:54:55,549
It was clear that British business people
were leaders in the slave trade, although

732
00:54:55,549 --> 00:55:01,559
Portugal, Spain, France and North America
were also involved.

733
00:55:01,559 --> 00:55:09,160
Our supply of sugar, coffee, tobacco, cotton,
silver and gold was completely dependent on

734
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:12,579
using slaves in the great plantations.

735
00:55:12,579 --> 00:55:19,150
By the 1730s some of the plantation owners,
many of whom lived in Britain, had become

736
00:55:19,150 --> 00:55:21,730
extremely wealthy.

737
00:55:21,730 --> 00:55:25,339
They had also become members of Parliament.

738
00:55:25,339 --> 00:55:29,430
This meant that they were able to influence
the laws dealing with the colonies of the

739
00:55:29,430 --> 00:55:30,910
Empire.

740
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:35,740
For two hundred years, laws were not passed
that would affect the source of their wealth

741
00:55:35,740 --> 00:55:40,589
- in this case, the slave trade.

742
00:55:40,589 --> 00:55:45,150
The North Americans had declared independence
in 1776.

743
00:55:45,150 --> 00:55:52,690
The colonists, many of them slave owners,
had defeated the British army, and the United

744
00:55:52,690 --> 00:55:58,950
States of America had elected their own politicians
and were making their own laws.

745
00:55:58,950 --> 00:56:06,650
However, it was British businessmen in British
ships who were still running the slave trade.

746
00:56:06,650 --> 00:56:11,739
They had developed a three-way system, which
was known as the triangular trade.

747
00:56:11,739 --> 00:56:18,690
Guns, alcohol and other goods produced in
Britain were shipped from there to Africa.

748
00:56:18,690 --> 00:56:24,299
Then local rulers exchanged the goods for
people - human beings who had been captured

749
00:56:24,299 --> 00:56:26,470
and had become slaves.

750
00:56:26,470 --> 00:56:32,440
The ships took the slaves across the Atlantic
Ocean where they were sold to plantation owners.

751
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:37,779
The ships, once they had delivered their human
cargo, would load up with products like sugar

752
00:56:37,779 --> 00:56:42,479
or tobacco and would then sail back to Britain.

753
00:56:42,479 --> 00:56:49,650
One evening at dinner, in 1783, I met a man
called James Ramsay, who had been a ship's

754
00:56:49,650 --> 00:56:54,739
doctor in the West Indies and later a Church
of England priest.

755
00:56:54,739 --> 00:57:01,250
He told me what he had seen on the ships arriving
from Africa and I was horrified.

756
00:57:01,250 --> 00:57:06,739
Slave traders would travel to Africa to find
or hunt and capture healthy-looking men and

757
00:57:06,739 --> 00:57:09,859
women, who were taken to large ships.

758
00:57:09,859 --> 00:57:15,640
They were chained together and put below decks
with hardly enough space for them to breathe,

759
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:18,309
let alone move.

760
00:57:18,309 --> 00:57:23,119
Conditions on the ships were terrible and
thousands died during the voyage.

761
00:57:23,119 --> 00:57:29,690
When the ships arrived at their destinations,
the slaves had to face the humiliating experience

762
00:57:29,690 --> 00:57:33,140
of being sold to their new owners.

763
00:57:33,140 --> 00:57:38,000
Those who had survived the trip were usually
in the most terrible physical condition - at

764
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:43,450
best, they were exhausted, starving and thin.

765
00:57:43,450 --> 00:57:49,249
On arrival they were washed, the men were
shaved and oil was put on their skins to make

766
00:57:49,249 --> 00:57:50,650
them look healthier.

767
00:57:50,650 --> 00:57:56,509
When the slaves had been made to look as good
as possible, potential buyers would come and

768
00:57:56,509 --> 00:58:02,499
examine them as if they were animals, to choose
which ones they wanted.

769
00:58:02,499 --> 00:58:06,210
The slaves were then sold in one of two ways.

770
00:58:06,210 --> 00:58:07,509
Sometimes an auction was held.

771
00:58:07,509 --> 00:58:12,739
At an auction, buyers would offer an amount
of money for a slave and the person offering

772
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:16,750
the greatest amount would be the one to buy
him or her.

773
00:58:16,750 --> 00:58:23,539
On other occasions, the slaves would be put
together into one room.

774
00:58:23,539 --> 00:58:28,650
The doors would open and the buyers would
all rush in and grab the slave or slaves they

775
00:58:28,650 --> 00:58:29,650
wanted.

776
00:58:29,650 --> 00:58:32,810
Either way, it was brutal.

777
00:58:32,810 --> 00:58:36,470
The slaves did not know what was going to
happen to them or where they were going to

778
00:58:36,470 --> 00:58:40,220
be taken, and they did not understand English.

779
00:58:40,220 --> 00:58:47,180
In total, more than fifteen million Africans
became slaves and it was estimated that over

780
00:58:47,180 --> 00:58:52,559
two million died during the dreadful eight-
to ten- week voyage from Africa.

781
00:58:52,559 --> 00:59:00,000
In 1787, a man called Thomas Clarkson came
to see me.

782
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:05,720
He had researched and written an essay on
the slave trade, and the facts were shocking.

783
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:11,960
The British Parliament found itself able to
accept slavery, but for me, the question was

784
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:13,589
what could be done about it.

785
00:59:13,589 --> 00:59:19,400
Looking around me, at the sugar, cotton, tobacco,
silver and gold that we took for granted in

786
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:26,359
our everyday lives, I felt that everything
I touched was tainted by slavery.

787
00:59:26,359 --> 00:59:31,640
The people who had power in government had
to be persuaded that slavery was wrong.

788
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:37,249
Clarkson, with two other men, had started
the Society for the Abolition of the Slave

789
00:59:37,249 --> 00:59:38,249
Trade.

790
00:59:38,249 --> 00:59:44,880
The Quakers, a religious group that did not
believe in slavery or war, also protested

791
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:48,400
but they were not taken seriously.

792
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:52,400
Because they disagreed with the principles
of the Church of England, the Quakers were

793
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:56,450
unpopular and so their protests had little
effect.

794
00:59:56,450 --> 01:00:02,839
James Ramsay had published An Inquiry into
the Effects of Putting a Stop to the African

795
01:00:02,839 --> 01:00:09,829
Slave Trade and Treatment and Conversion of
African Slaves in the British Sugar Colonies.

796
01:00:09,829 --> 01:00:13,920
Because he was a Church of England priest
he had more influence in the government than

797
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:15,950
the Quakers.

798
01:00:15,950 --> 01:00:20,279
Ordinary people had to be told the truth about
slavery.

799
01:00:20,279 --> 01:00:25,539
Most of them had no idea where their sugar
or tobacco came from and the few who did know

800
01:00:25,539 --> 01:00:30,319
had no idea how terrible life was for the
slaves on the plantations.

801
01:00:30,319 --> 01:00:38,470
A campaign was started to educate the British
people about the truth of slavery and slowly

802
01:00:38,470 --> 01:00:41,150
people began to listen.

803
01:00:41,150 --> 01:00:47,460
From then onwards, I focused all my energy
on trying to achieve my goal of making the

804
01:00:47,460 --> 01:00:49,970
slave trade illegal.

805
01:00:49,970 --> 01:00:54,670
Day after day and night after night, I tried
to convince people.

806
01:00:54,670 --> 01:00:57,729
But it was a hard fight.

807
01:00:57,729 --> 01:01:03,400
All around me there were people - rich influential
people - who benefited from slavery.

808
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:09,249
In 1790, I was allowed to set up a committee
to look at the slave trade and examine how

809
01:01:09,249 --> 01:01:11,410
it was operated.

810
01:01:11,410 --> 01:01:17,569
The following year I introduced the first
bill to abolish slavery but the politicians

811
01:01:17,569 --> 01:01:23,520
voted against it.

812
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:27,739
They said there were more important issues
to be considered because of the threat presented

813
01:01:27,739 --> 01:01:31,789
by the French Revolution and the rise of Napoleon.

814
01:01:31,789 --> 01:01:37,259
They were also afraid of the new United States
of America and questioned if it was right

815
01:01:37,259 --> 01:01:40,390
that we should interfere with their slave
system.

816
01:01:40,390 --> 01:01:46,119
The politicians even went as far as to suggest
that it was the Americans' job, not ours,

817
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:48,569
to stop the practice of slavery.

818
01:01:48,569 --> 01:01:55,160
This did not stop me, however, and I continued
to raise the question of slavery at every

819
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:57,210
opportunity.

820
01:01:57,210 --> 01:01:58,210
***

821
01:01:58,210 --> 01:02:03,229
I was so busy working and fighting for my
beliefs that my personal life had suffered

822
01:02:03,229 --> 01:02:05,229
and I was alone.

823
01:02:05,229 --> 01:02:10,700
Romance was the last thing on my mind until
I met the woman I would marry.

824
01:02:10,700 --> 01:02:18,170
In 1797 a friend introduced me to a young
woman called Barbara Ann Spooner, whose smile

825
01:02:18,170 --> 01:02:20,109
filled me with joy.

826
01:02:20,109 --> 01:02:24,809
The day after I met her, I sent a note suggesting
that we meet again.

827
01:02:24,809 --> 01:02:28,390
She agreed and we talked about my work.

828
01:02:28,390 --> 01:02:33,369
Within a few days, I had made up my mind and
at a private dinner, I asked her if she would

829
01:02:33,369 --> 01:02:35,109
be my wife.

830
01:02:35,109 --> 01:02:39,749
To my delight she agreed and we starting making
plans for our wedding.

831
01:02:39,749 --> 01:02:45,539
Our family and friends were not so enthusiastic
as we had only known each other for eight

832
01:02:45,539 --> 01:02:46,539
days.

833
01:02:46,539 --> 01:02:51,140
Barbara may have been eighteen years younger
than I was - which was not unusual at the

834
01:02:51,140 --> 01:02:55,359
time - but I knew I had found true love.

835
01:02:55,359 --> 01:03:01,089
In the next ten years we had six children
and my life at home filled me with the strength

836
01:03:01,089 --> 01:03:03,650
to continue my battles at work.

837
01:03:03,650 --> 01:03:11,030
My political campaign against slavery continued
at full speed, gradually gaining support and

838
01:03:11,030 --> 01:03:18,609
on 22nd February 1807, the Slave Trade Act
was passed, making the buying and selling

839
01:03:18,609 --> 01:03:19,859
of slaves illegal.

840
01:03:19,859 --> 01:03:30,119
The British Parliament had decided with 283
votes for, and only 16 against, the Act.

841
01:03:30,119 --> 01:03:36,789
The next year, the USA also made the slave
trade illegal, but it did not succeed in actually

842
01:03:36,789 --> 01:03:41,279
stopping the trade of slaves, nor slavery
itself.

843
01:03:41,279 --> 01:03:46,770
There was clearly a lot more to be done before
the practice of slavery would end and the

844
01:03:46,770 --> 01:03:49,250
slaves would be given their freedom.

845
01:03:49,250 --> 01:03:56,410
In 1816, the names and personal details of
all the slaves were written down in an official

846
01:03:56,410 --> 01:04:01,109
list, and I started looking at other important
issues.

847
01:04:01,109 --> 01:04:06,559
I wanted Parliament to pass laws to improve
working conditions, especially for children

848
01:04:06,559 --> 01:04:08,660
and factory workers.

849
01:04:08,660 --> 01:04:13,859
What I did not agree with was giving workers
the right to organize unions because I was

850
01:04:13,859 --> 01:04:17,920
worried that this would lead to revolution,
as it had in France.

851
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:24,229
I was also concerned about people's morals
and I fully supported Bible studies for children

852
01:04:24,229 --> 01:04:30,170
at Sunday School as well as helping to establish
the Church Missionary Society.

853
01:04:30,170 --> 01:04:34,869
But my focus remained on abolishing slavery.

854
01:04:34,869 --> 01:04:42,599
In 1833, the Slave Abolition Act was passed,
banning slavery in most colonies of the British

855
01:04:42,599 --> 01:04:46,410
Empire and giving the slaves their freedom.

856
01:04:46,410 --> 01:04:52,999
Full credit should go to Thomas Clarkson and
others for their efforts.

857
01:04:52,999 --> 01:04:58,969
By that time, I was nearly blind and very
much poorer than when I had started my campaign.

858
01:04:58,969 --> 01:05:05,930
My death came within days of the passing of
the Act but my sacrifices were minor compared

859
01:05:05,930 --> 01:05:08,819
to those of the slaves.

860
01:05:08,819 --> 01:05:14,640
While their 'Christian' owners had been seen
praying in church, more than two million slaves

861
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:21,000
had been killed, millions more had been beaten
and countless were badly-treated and worked

862
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,000
to death.

863
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:29,999
With the 1833 Act, my life's work to ban slavery
by the British had been achieved.

864
01:05:29,999 --> 01:05:37,599
But elsewhere the battle continued.

865
01:05:37,599 --> 01:05:42,710
The Life of William Wilberforce

866
01:05:42,710 --> 01:05:48,450
1759 William Wilberforce was born in Hull,
Yorkshire, England.

867
01:05:48,450 --> 01:05:50,970
1767 He began his schooling at Hull Grammar
School.

868
01:05:50,970 --> 01:05:54,229
1768 At the age of nine, William's father
died.

869
01:05:54,229 --> 01:06:05,700
He was sent to live with his aunt and uncle
at their homes in London and Wimbledon.

870
01:06:05,700 --> 01:06:13,259
William was sent to a boarding school in Putney
and spent his holidays with relatives.

871
01:06:13,259 --> 01:06:17,130
1771 William's mother and grandfather were
concerned about his religious instruction,

872
01:06:17,130 --> 01:06:19,660
and therefore brought him back to Hull.

873
01:06:19,660 --> 01:06:22,560
1776 He attended St John's College, in Cambridge.

874
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:25,089
His grandfather died, followed by his uncle.

875
01:06:25,089 --> 01:06:29,160
Their deaths left William with his own money
to spend as he pleased.

876
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:36,019
1780 While still a student, on September 11th,
William was elected as a Member of Parliament

877
01:06:36,019 --> 01:06:37,019
for Kingston-upon-Hull.

878
01:06:37,019 --> 01:06:40,460
1783 His friend, William Pitt, was elected
Prime Minister.

879
01:06:40,460 --> 01:06:50,490
1784 William was elected as a Member of Parliament
for the county of Yorkshire in the general

880
01:06:50,490 --> 01:06:51,490
election.

881
01:06:51,490 --> 01:07:00,239
In October, he toured Europe with his mother,
sister and Isaac Milner, the brother of his

882
01:07:00,239 --> 01:07:01,319
former headmaster.

883
01:07:01,319 --> 01:07:05,079
1785 He returned to England to support Pitt's
Parliamentary changes before continuing his

884
01:07:05,079 --> 01:07:06,089
travels to Italy and Switzerland.

885
01:07:06,089 --> 01:07:13,020
William read The Rise and Progress of Religion
in the Soul which had a serious effect on

886
01:07:13,020 --> 01:07:14,020
him.

887
01:07:14,020 --> 01:07:15,880
He began to pray and read the Bible.

888
01:07:15,880 --> 01:07:18,740
1786 William rented a house near Parliament,
in Westminster.

889
01:07:18,740 --> 01:07:21,979
He used his position to promote changes in
the law.

890
01:07:21,979 --> 01:07:28,739
1787 Thomas Clarkson began calling on William
and asked him to bring forward the case to

891
01:07:28,739 --> 01:07:32,210
the House of Commons for the Abolition of
Slavery.

892
01:07:32,210 --> 01:07:38,359
The first meeting of the Society for Effecting
the Abolition of the Slave Trade took place.

893
01:07:38,359 --> 01:07:43,039
1789 On May 12th, William delivered his first
speech in the House of Commons against the

894
01:07:43,039 --> 01:07:44,059
slave trade.

895
01:07:44,059 --> 01:07:48,349
He also introduced his first bill to abolish
the slave trade.

896
01:07:48,349 --> 01:07:54,479
1790 He gained approval for a Parliamentary
Select Committee to consider the slave trade

897
01:07:54,479 --> 01:07:56,229
and examine the evidence.

898
01:07:56,229 --> 01:07:57,229
1791 In April, the first Parliamentary Bill
was introduced.

899
01:07:57,229 --> 01:07:58,229
It was defeated by 163 votes to 88.

900
01:07:58,229 --> 01:07:59,229
From then on, William introduced a motion
of favour of abolition during every session

901
01:07:59,229 --> 01:08:00,229
of Parliament.

902
01:08:00,229 --> 01:08:01,229
1793-1798 The war in France meant that although
the subject of the slave trade continued to

903
01:08:01,229 --> 01:08:02,229
be debated in Parliament, serious consideration
was never given to it.

904
01:08:02,229 --> 01:08:03,229
1797 William met and married Barbara Spooner.

905
01:08:03,229 --> 01:08:04,229
They had six children over the next ten years.

906
01:08:04,229 --> 01:08:05,229
1799 The Slave Trade Regulation Act was passed
to reduce overcrowding on slave ships.

907
01:08:05,229 --> 01:08:06,229
1804 William helped to start the British and
Foreign Bible Society and the Church Missionary

908
01:08:06,229 --> 01:08:07,229
Society.

909
01:08:07,229 --> 01:08:08,229
1806 The new Foreign Slave Trade Act was passed.

910
01:08:08,229 --> 01:08:09,229
It banned all British people from helping
in any way or taking part in the slave trade

911
01:08:09,229 --> 01:08:10,229
to the French colonies.

912
01:08:10,229 --> 01:08:11,229
In effect, the Act stopped two-thirds of the
British slave trade.

913
01:08:11,229 --> 01:08:12,229
1807 On February 23rd, the British Parliament
finally abolished the slave trade.

914
01:08:12,229 --> 01:08:13,229
Then on March 25th the Abolition of the Slave
Trade Act was passed.

915
01:08:13,229 --> 01:08:14,229
It stopped the trading of slaves, but did
not actually abolish slavery.

916
01:08:14,229 --> 01:08:15,229
1822 William helped form the Anti-Slavery
Society.

917
01:08:15,229 --> 01:08:16,229
1823 He launched the campaign for slaves to
be given their freedom.

918
01:08:16,229 --> 01:08:17,229
1825 He retired from Parliament after 45 years
of service.

919
01:08:17,229 --> 01:08:18,229
1833 William died aged 73, in London, England.

920
01:08:18,229 --> 01:08:19,229
Just three days before his death, on July
26th, the Slavery Abolition Act was passed.

921
01:08:19,229 --> 01:08:20,229
Slavery was abolished in the whole of the
British Empire and all the slaves within it

922
01:08:20,229 --> 01:08:21,229
were given their freedom.

923
01:08:21,229 --> 01:08:22,229
CHAPTER FIVE
Karl Marx - the man who wrote The Communist

924
01:08:22,229 --> 01:08:23,229
Manifesto and Das Kapital
1818-1883

925
01:08:23,229 --> 01:08:24,229
I was not born into poverty but I hated the
inequality between the very rich and the very

926
01:08:24,229 --> 01:08:25,229
poor.

927
01:08:25,229 --> 01:08:26,229
I spent my life, through my writing, fighting
for equality.

928
01:08:26,229 --> 01:08:27,229
I believed that everybody, whatever their
class and financial state, should have the

929
01:08:27,229 --> 01:08:28,229
same rights.

930
01:08:28,229 --> 01:08:29,229
***

931
01:08:29,229 --> 01:08:30,229
I was born in 1818 in the city of Trier in
Germany.

932
01:08:30,229 --> 01:08:31,229
My father was a lawyer and my mother had more
than a full-time job looking after my father,

933
01:08:31,229 --> 01:08:32,229
myself and my eight brothers and sisters.

934
01:08:32,229 --> 01:08:33,229
We had a comfortable life and I didn't go
to school until I was twelve because until

935
01:08:33,229 --> 01:08:34,229
that point I had been educated at home by
private tutors.

936
01:08:34,229 --> 01:08:35,229
After attending the high school in Trier for
five years, I went to the University of Bonn

937
01:08:35,229 --> 01:08:36,229
and studied law.

938
01:08:36,229 --> 01:08:37,229
Like many students suddenly thrown into an
adult world, I found myself in a bit of trouble.

939
01:08:37,229 --> 01:08:38,229
I got into debt, had fights and once was even
sent to prison.

940
01:08:38,229 --> 01:08:39,229
My father was not very pleased with my behaviour
and insisted that I take my studies more seriously.

941
01:08:39,229 --> 01:08:40,229
At his suggestion - and as he was paying the
bills, I didn't really have much choice - I

942
01:08:40,229 --> 01:08:41,229
moved to the University of Berlin, where I
studied law and philosophy.

943
01:08:41,229 --> 01:08:42,229
In Berlin I joined a group of students called
the Young Hegelians, who were occupied with

944
01:08:42,229 --> 01:08:43,229
criticizing the political and religious authorities.

945
01:08:43,229 --> 01:08:44,229
The group was based on the teachings of the
philosopher Hegel.

946
01:08:44,229 --> 01:08:45,229
I was not, in the beginning, that interested
in his theories but I became an active member

947
01:08:45,229 --> 01:08:46,229
as my interest in politics grew.

948
01:08:46,229 --> 01:08:47,229
It was during this time that I met my future
wife, Jenny von Westphalen.

949
01:08:47,229 --> 01:08:48,229
Jenny came from quite an upper-class family
and there were many people who were interested

950
01:08:48,229 --> 01:08:49,229
in her apart from me.

951
01:08:49,229 --> 01:08:50,229
She was also four years older than I was.

952
01:08:50,229 --> 01:08:51,229
We got engaged, secretly, and did not get
married until seven years later.

953
01:08:51,229 --> 01:08:52,229
In 1841, I got my Doctorate in Philosophy
but due to my political beliefs, which others

954
01:08:52,229 --> 01:08:53,229
saw as being extreme and unwelcome, I was
not able to get a teaching position at the

955
01:08:53,229 --> 01:08:54,229
university.

956
01:08:54,229 --> 01:08:55,229
In fact, I was forced to leave altogether.

957
01:08:55,229 --> 01:08:56,229
The people in power were feeling increasingly
threatened by the articles I was publishing

958
01:08:56,229 --> 01:08:57,229
which demanded a better life for the poor.

959
01:08:57,229 --> 01:08:58,229
I went to live in Cologne, where I started
a left-wing political newspaper, then I moved

960
01:08:58,229 --> 01:08:59,229
to Paris for a short time, where Jenny and
I got married.

961
01:08:59,229 --> 01:09:00,229
However, it didn't seem to matter where I
went to live, because wherever I was, my views

962
01:09:00,229 --> 01:09:01,229
on life were unpopular.

963
01:09:01,229 --> 01:09:02,229
After Cologne, the city of Brussels, in Belgium,
seemed to be a good place to live and we stayed

964
01:09:02,229 --> 01:09:03,229
there for two years.

965
01:09:03,229 --> 01:09:04,229
I met my dear and life-long friend Friedrich
Engels and also I became involved with people

966
01:09:04,229 --> 01:09:05,229
from the Communist League.

967
01:09:05,229 --> 01:09:06,229
The communists believed that the government
should own a country's wealth - its industry,

968
01:09:06,229 --> 01:09:07,540
property and natural resources - and that
it should be shared equally with everyone.

969
01:09:07,540 --> 01:09:12,370
They thought it was unfair that the upper
classes and the aristocracy, who were a tiny

970
01:09:12,370 --> 01:09:17,850
minority of the population, should have so
much while the working classes had almost

971
01:09:17,850 --> 01:09:19,850
nothing.

972
01:09:19,850 --> 01:09:24,980
The Communist League asked me to write down
the principles of communism in a document

973
01:09:24,980 --> 01:09:29,240
that could be read and used by everyone, which
I did.

974
01:09:29,240 --> 01:09:35,330
I explained in my writing that the working
class is exploited by the upper-class capitalists

975
01:09:35,330 --> 01:09:38,500
whom I called the bourgeoisie.

976
01:09:38,500 --> 01:09:41,920
Capitalists get rich from the work done by
the poor.

977
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:49,460
The true value of something - goods or services
- is the amount of work actually done.

978
01:09:49,460 --> 01:09:54,790
Any extra money that is made - profit - should
belong to the people who did the work and

979
01:09:54,790 --> 01:09:57,550
not the capitalists.

980
01:09:57,550 --> 01:10:02,990
The only way that this situation can be changed
is if the workers have the power to make rules.

981
01:10:02,990 --> 01:10:10,330
This can only be done if working classes take
power away from the capitalists by using force

982
01:10:10,330 --> 01:10:12,600
and violence.

983
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:17,710
No wealth should belong to individuals and
all governments should be abolished.

984
01:10:17,710 --> 01:10:24,830
I ended with the following: 'Working men of
all countries, unite!'

985
01:10:24,830 --> 01:10:29,250
My involvement in the League drew attention
to my political views and I made yet more

986
01:10:29,250 --> 01:10:33,210
enemies by speaking out for change and equality.

987
01:10:33,210 --> 01:10:38,810
I was accused of trying to cause a revolution,
but I answered that if a revolution happened,

988
01:10:38,810 --> 01:10:43,320
it would be the poverty of the people, not
me, that was responsible.

989
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:48,710
The poor were in the majority, but they had
no votes and therefore no power to change

990
01:10:48,710 --> 01:10:50,280
the situation.

991
01:10:50,280 --> 01:10:57,210
By 1849, many European countries were in the
middle of bitter revolutions and it was then

992
01:10:57,210 --> 01:11:03,210
that Engels and I, now back in Cologne, published
The Communist Manifesto, which was based on

993
01:11:03,210 --> 01:11:06,310
the written work I had done for the Communist
League.

994
01:11:06,310 --> 01:11:12,110
This was seen as a huge challenge to the civilized
life enjoyed by the upper classes, and the

995
01:11:12,110 --> 01:11:16,530
continuous threats that were being made to
my life made it necessary for me to leave

996
01:11:16,530 --> 01:11:18,640
Cologne, too.

997
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:25,050
I had not shot or injured anyone, but I was
seen as an enemy, so I decided we should move

998
01:11:25,050 --> 01:11:27,860
to London.

999
01:11:27,860 --> 01:11:34,370
There I could write and spread my message
through my publications.

1000
01:11:34,370 --> 01:11:42,730
Perhaps the British would be more open to
hearing what I had to say.

1001
01:11:42,730 --> 01:11:43,730
***

1002
01:11:43,730 --> 01:11:48,870
Living conditions in Berlin, Paris and Brussels
had been bad but the poverty and misery in

1003
01:11:48,870 --> 01:11:53,460
London were far worse than anything I had
ever seen.

1004
01:11:53,460 --> 01:11:58,620
The streets were full of people who had no
choice other than to steal food or even pick

1005
01:11:58,620 --> 01:12:02,710
out rotting food from the rubbish to survive.

1006
01:12:02,710 --> 01:12:07,710
Many had no homes and were forced to live
on the streets, which were filthy and full

1007
01:12:07,710 --> 01:12:08,710
of rats.

1008
01:12:08,710 --> 01:12:12,660
Then there was the workhouse.

1009
01:12:12,660 --> 01:12:16,800
In 1834 the first workhouses were opened.

1010
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:21,810
They were supposed to be places where people
who had absolutely nothing could go and live.

1011
01:12:21,810 --> 01:12:27,370
The government was afraid that 'lazy' people
would take advantage and so conditions inside

1012
01:12:27,370 --> 01:12:32,440
were made incredibly brutal and humiliating.

1013
01:12:32,440 --> 01:12:37,160
They did provide food and shelter for those
who would have died otherwise, but they were

1014
01:12:37,160 --> 01:12:42,000
widely hated, so much so that many preferred
to take their chances out in the streets than

1015
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:45,920
face the shame and stigma of the workhouse.

1016
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:53,190
There had been much whispering of the word
revolution and a group called the Chartists

1017
01:12:53,190 --> 01:12:57,220
had long been planning a series of political
attacks.

1018
01:12:57,220 --> 01:13:02,730
The Chartists were an organization that wanted
the government to be elected in a fairer way.

1019
01:13:02,730 --> 01:13:07,580
They wanted every man over the age of twenty-one
to have the right to vote.

1020
01:13:07,580 --> 01:13:12,180
At the time, only men who had property that
could be rented for at least ten pounds a

1021
01:13:12,180 --> 01:13:14,770
year could vote.

1022
01:13:14,770 --> 01:13:20,710
This meant that six out of every seven men
did not have the right to vote.

1023
01:13:20,710 --> 01:13:25,370
The Chartists were also campaigning for a
more acceptable system of representation in

1024
01:13:25,370 --> 01:13:27,440
the government.

1025
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:32,270
Large cities, where mainly poor people with
no property lived, often did not have even

1026
01:13:32,270 --> 01:13:35,920
one member of parliament representing them.

1027
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:41,300
Unfortunately, the Chartists were neither
well-organized nor successful.

1028
01:13:41,300 --> 01:13:46,471
I agreed with their principles and set to
work in the British Library - where it was

1029
01:13:46,471 --> 01:13:51,780
only possible to get access if you could prove
you were a serious researcher - to write the

1030
01:13:51,780 --> 01:13:55,630
plan that would get rid of capitalism.

1031
01:13:55,630 --> 01:14:00,250
This would be a plan that would remove the
great class divides between the rich and the

1032
01:14:00,250 --> 01:14:04,780
poor.

1033
01:14:04,780 --> 01:14:11,810
My ideas were ahead of their time as the people
in London had not yet heard about communism.

1034
01:14:11,810 --> 01:14:16,770
In the north of England, however, factory
and mine workers started to join together

1035
01:14:16,770 --> 01:14:22,860
to form unions to try and negotiate with the
government over working conditions.

1036
01:14:22,860 --> 01:14:28,790
New innovations like electricity and gas were
comforts for those who already had comfortable

1037
01:14:28,790 --> 01:14:30,260
lives.

1038
01:14:30,260 --> 01:14:34,780
The living conditions of the poor, who would
not have either electricity or gas for a long

1039
01:14:34,780 --> 01:14:37,410
time, were not getting better.

1040
01:14:37,410 --> 01:14:44,250
In fact, life became worse as more and more
people were attracted to the large cities.

1041
01:14:44,250 --> 01:14:50,670
The major cities, already too full, were becoming
unbearably overcrowded as people like myself

1042
01:14:50,670 --> 01:14:53,060
arrived from Europe.

1043
01:14:53,060 --> 01:15:01,190
In 1845-1846 a terrible famine happened in
Ireland when that year's potato crop failed.

1044
01:15:01,190 --> 01:15:07,330
The potato was one of the basic foods in Ireland
and without it, people starved.

1045
01:15:07,330 --> 01:15:10,320
The Irish who could, travelled to other countries.

1046
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:14,210
Many moved to the USA but many others came
to England.

1047
01:15:14,210 --> 01:15:22,750
By 1849, 20 per cent of the population of
London were now Irish and like my family,

1048
01:15:22,750 --> 01:15:27,060
they were all immigrants - people who had
come from another country in search of a better

1049
01:15:27,060 --> 01:15:29,520
life.

1050
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:36,160
We lived at 28 Dean Street, and paid twenty-two
pounds a year in rent for two basic rooms

1051
01:15:36,160 --> 01:15:38,710
in very bad condition.

1052
01:15:38,710 --> 01:15:41,710
It was very cramped as we were a large family.

1053
01:15:41,710 --> 01:15:49,210
My wife gave birth to seven babies but only
three of them lived to adulthood.

1054
01:15:49,210 --> 01:15:55,080
This horrible situation was far from unusual
and I was sure the terrible conditions - the

1055
01:15:55,080 --> 01:16:01,560
filth and poverty - played a major role in
the high death rate among children.

1056
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:06,210
My family's accommodation and living standards
were far better than some, even though I was

1057
01:16:06,210 --> 01:16:08,440
not able to earn a living.

1058
01:16:08,440 --> 01:16:14,050
Nobody would employ me and if it had not been
for the generous help of my friend, Engels,

1059
01:16:14,050 --> 01:16:18,540
I do not think any members of my family would
have survived at all.

1060
01:16:18,540 --> 01:16:24,150
The Dukes of Bedford, Norfolk and Westminster
in their country estates were earning huge

1061
01:16:24,150 --> 01:16:29,760
rents from the poor, who had to live in filthy,
disgusting conditions.

1062
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:36,490
We all lived in the same country but it was
as if we were in two different worlds: ours,

1063
01:16:36,490 --> 01:16:41,080
the working class, and the other that belonged
to the upper class.

1064
01:16:41,080 --> 01:16:46,390
I could not accept that a person who was unlucky
enough to have been born into a poor family

1065
01:16:46,390 --> 01:16:50,310
was forced to live a life of misery.

1066
01:16:50,310 --> 01:16:55,540
Across the English Channel, many countries
were in a state of anxious confusion, with

1067
01:16:55,540 --> 01:17:00,150
people demonstrating in the streets to get
better conditions.

1068
01:17:00,150 --> 01:17:04,120
I was sure that this would happen in Britain,
too.

1069
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:09,900
After all, it was the place where the Industrial
Revolution had begun, I spent my days researching

1070
01:17:09,900 --> 01:17:10,900
and writing.

1071
01:17:10,900 --> 01:17:13,620
'A spectre is haunting Europe,' I wrote.

1072
01:17:13,620 --> 01:17:17,870
'The spectre of Communism.'

1073
01:17:17,870 --> 01:17:22,280
Looking around the miserable streets of London,
I waited.

1074
01:17:22,280 --> 01:17:26,980
Surely the working class would rise up and
take action.

1075
01:17:26,980 --> 01:17:35,220
But despite my best efforts to develop protest
through my writing, there was no revolution.

1076
01:17:35,220 --> 01:17:40,600
Some capitalists had produced useful innovations
- in addition to the gas and electricity we

1077
01:17:40,600 --> 01:17:45,770
already had, the invention of the telephone
improved communications.

1078
01:17:45,770 --> 01:17:51,390
But despite this, the working people continued
to be exploited in industry and agriculture,

1079
01:17:51,390 --> 01:17:53,980
in the factories and fields.

1080
01:17:53,980 --> 01:18:00,060
My proposal was to have a revolution by democratic
means - let all men have the right to vote

1081
01:18:00,060 --> 01:18:06,330
and elect the government of their choice and
then if that was not successful, we would

1082
01:18:06,330 --> 01:18:10,390
need to fight.

1083
01:18:10,390 --> 01:18:14,590
'From each according to his abilities, to
each according to their needs.'

1084
01:18:14,590 --> 01:18:19,250
That was the message I was trying to communicate
in Das Kapital - the most famous of all my

1085
01:18:19,250 --> 01:18:21,190
books.

1086
01:18:21,190 --> 01:18:26,190
I wanted to look in more depth at what I had
outlined in The Communist Manifesto.

1087
01:18:26,190 --> 01:18:31,890
I tried to explain how capitalism had developed
and what its future might be.

1088
01:18:31,890 --> 01:18:37,630
I focused on economic theory and described
more fully the relationship between workers

1089
01:18:37,630 --> 01:18:44,640
and capitalists, showing how workers are exploited
and giving specific examples from the past.

1090
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:53,060
My aim was to demonstrate that capitalism
is unstable and why it should be abolished.

1091
01:18:53,060 --> 01:18:57,770
I believed there was a need for a 'science
of society'.

1092
01:18:57,770 --> 01:19:04,540
I saw that the class struggle was inevitable
- the struggle between capitalism and communism

1093
01:19:04,540 --> 01:19:08,440
or more simply, between the 'haves' and the
'have nots'.

1094
01:19:08,440 --> 01:19:14,590
It would be an economic civil war that would
change politics forever.

1095
01:19:14,590 --> 01:19:20,640
In 1871, after the Paris Commune rebellion,
where the people of Paris fought against the

1096
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:27,150
government, I wrote a pamphlet - a short book
- called The Civil War in France, which became

1097
01:19:27,150 --> 01:19:29,060
famous.

1098
01:19:29,060 --> 01:19:34,470
I hoped that the struggle for equality would
occur peacefully, but feared that it would

1099
01:19:34,470 --> 01:19:41,040
not, especially not in my lifetime.

1100
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:49,170
In 1883, I died at the age of sixty-four,
two years after the death of my wife, Jenny,

1101
01:19:49,170 --> 01:19:51,750
and I was buried in Highgate Cemetery in north
London.

1102
01:19:51,750 --> 01:19:52,750
The Life of Karl Marx

1103
01:19:52,750 --> 01:19:53,750
1818 Karl Heinrich Marx was born in Trier,
in the Prussian Rhineland.

1104
01:19:53,750 --> 01:19:54,750
1819 The family moved to a ten-room property
near the Porta Nigra, in Trier.

1105
01:19:54,750 --> 01:19:55,750
1830 Karl attended Trier High School after
his private education ended.

1106
01:19:55,750 --> 01:19:56,750
1835 He studied law at the University of Bonn.

1107
01:19:56,750 --> 01:19:57,750
The following year, Karl studied at the University
of Berlin, where he continued to study law.

1108
01:19:57,750 --> 01:19:58,750
1837 Karl joined the Young Hegelians.

1109
01:19:58,750 --> 01:19:59,750
He wrote a novel, Scorpion and Felix and a
drama, Oulanem, but they were not published.

1110
01:19:59,750 --> 01:20:00,750
1841 Karl earned his Doctorate in Philosophy
with his thesis The Difference Between the

1111
01:20:00,750 --> 01:20:01,750
Democritean and Epicurean Philosophy of Nature.

1112
01:20:01,750 --> 01:20:02,750
1842 Karl lived as a refugee in Cologne, where
he was a journalist for a left-wing newspaper

1113
01:20:02,750 --> 01:20:03,750
called Rhenish.

1114
01:20:03,750 --> 01:20:04,750
He later became the Editor-in-Chief

1115
01:20:04,750 --> 01:20:05,750
1843 Karl married Jenny von Westphalen.

1116
01:20:05,750 --> 01:20:06,750
They moved to Paris, where Karl studied political
economy, the French socialists and the history

1117
01:20:06,750 --> 01:20:07,750
of France.

1118
01:20:07,750 --> 01:20:08,750
1844 He met German socialist Friedrich Engels.

1119
01:20:08,750 --> 01:20:09,750
On the Jewish Question and The Economic and
Philosophical Manuscripts were published.

1120
01:20:09,750 --> 01:20:10,750
The following year, he wrote Theses on Feuerbach,
which was not published until after his death.

1121
01:20:10,750 --> 01:20:11,750
1845 Karl, Jenny and Friedrich moved to Brussels,
Belgium.

1122
01:20:11,750 --> 01:20:12,750
Karl and Friedrich published a criticism of
the philosophical ideas of Bruno Bauer called

1123
01:20:12,750 --> 01:20:13,750
The Holy Family.

1124
01:20:13,750 --> 01:20:14,750
They visited London and met the leaders of
the Chartists.

1125
01:20:14,750 --> 01:20:15,750
With Friedrich, Karl wrote The German Ideology,
which was published after his death.

1126
01:20:15,750 --> 01:20:16,750
1847 He wrote The Poverty of Philosophy.

1127
01:20:16,750 --> 01:20:17,750
1848 Karl and Jenny moved back to Cologne.

1128
01:20:17,750 --> 01:20:18,750
He started the publication of the left-wing
political paper, New Rhenish Newspaper.

1129
01:20:18,750 --> 01:20:19,750
Karl and Friedrich published The Communist
Manifesto.

1130
01:20:19,750 --> 01:20:20,750
Europe was in the middle of violent revolutions.

1131
01:20:20,750 --> 01:20:21,750
1849 Unable to return to Germany or Belgium,
Karl and Jenny moved to London, where he became

1132
01:20:21,750 --> 01:20:22,750
involved in the German Workers' Educational
Society.

1133
01:20:22,750 --> 01:20:23,750
1851 Karl wrote about the French Revolution
of 1848, The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis

1134
01:20:23,750 --> 01:20:24,750
Napoleon.

1135
01:20:24,750 --> 01:20:25,750
1852 He wrote for the New York Daily Tribune.

1136
01:20:25,750 --> 01:20:26,750
1859 Karl published Contribution to the Critique
of Political Economy.

1137
01:20:26,750 --> 01:20:27,750
1864 He became involved in the International
Workingmen's Association and was elected to

1138
01:20:27,750 --> 01:20:28,750
the General Council.

1139
01:20:28,750 --> 01:20:29,750
1867 The first volume of Capital: Critique
of Political Economy (Das Kapital) was published.

1140
01:20:29,750 --> 01:20:30,750
1871 When the citizens of Paris rebelled against
the government during the Paris Commune, Karl

1141
01:20:30,750 --> 01:20:31,750
wrote one of his most famous pamphlets, The
Civil War in France.

1142
01:20:31,750 --> 01:20:32,750
1881 His wife, Jenny, died.

1143
01:20:32,750 --> 01:20:33,750
1883 Karl died aged 64, in London, England.

1144
01:20:33,750 --> 01:20:34,750
CHAPTER SIX
Mahatma Gandhi - the man who helped free India

1145
01:20:34,750 --> 01:20:35,750
from British rule
1869-1948

1146
01:20:35,750 --> 01:20:36,750
All my life, all I ever wanted was for India
to be an independent, united country.

1147
01:20:36,750 --> 01:20:37,750
I wanted a peaceful end to 350 years of British
rule.

1148
01:20:37,750 --> 01:20:38,750
The British did leave but to my deepest regret,
they left behind an India that was divided

1149
01:20:38,750 --> 01:20:39,750
in two.

1150
01:20:39,750 --> 01:20:40,750
***

1151
01:20:40,750 --> 01:20:41,750
I was born in Porbandar, a city on the west
coast of India, where most people lived in

1152
01:20:41,750 --> 01:20:42,750
poverty and hardship.

1153
01:20:42,750 --> 01:20:43,750
We were lucky - my father was the chief minister
of the city - so we had a decent standard

1154
01:20:43,750 --> 01:20:44,750
of living.

1155
01:20:44,750 --> 01:20:46,610
My mother was a true follower of Jainism - an
Indian religion that believed, among other

1156
01:20:46,610 --> 01:20:50,170
things, in complete self-control.

1157
01:20:50,170 --> 01:20:55,230
This meant that although we were not poor,
our lifestyle was a simple one.

1158
01:20:55,230 --> 01:21:00,300
India was under the rule of the British Raj
and many white men from the British Isles

1159
01:21:00,300 --> 01:21:02,690
were sent to our country.

1160
01:21:02,690 --> 01:21:08,710
They forced their law on us, but could not
change our customs and beliefs.

1161
01:21:08,710 --> 01:21:12,670
People who believed in Jainism thought that
differences between people should be solved

1162
01:21:12,670 --> 01:21:18,090
with respect, mutual tolerance and understanding
- not violence.

1163
01:21:18,090 --> 01:21:22,900
I followed these principles faithfully my
entire life.

1164
01:21:22,900 --> 01:21:29,570
I was married at the age of thirteen to a
girl a year older than me who was called Kasturba.

1165
01:21:29,570 --> 01:21:35,750
As was the custom, it was an arranged marriage
with neither of us having any say in the matter.

1166
01:21:35,750 --> 01:21:41,460
Over the years we had four sons, although
our first child, born two years into our marriage,

1167
01:21:41,460 --> 01:21:44,770
died just a few days after birth.

1168
01:21:44,770 --> 01:21:50,880
Medical facilities were limited and basic
and many babies and children died as a result.

1169
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:56,020
I was fortunate enough to have a good education
and I decided that I wanted to study law.

1170
01:21:56,020 --> 01:22:00,750
I had heard a great deal about all the fine
cities in Britain and the place I wanted to

1171
01:22:00,750 --> 01:22:06,340
go was London, which, I had heard, was the
greatest of them all.

1172
01:22:06,340 --> 01:22:13,870
So, having gained a place at University College
London, I left India.

1173
01:22:13,870 --> 01:22:18,850
It was a complete culture shock to arrive
in such a big city after living my whole life

1174
01:22:18,850 --> 01:22:20,460
in Porbandar.

1175
01:22:20,460 --> 01:22:25,601
I was used to the heat of India, and the cold
and never-ending damp of England was not a

1176
01:22:25,601 --> 01:22:27,930
pleasant experience for me.

1177
01:22:27,930 --> 01:22:33,420
I no longer kicked up dust on the roads of
my hometown - in London you were more likely

1178
01:22:33,420 --> 01:22:35,960
to be covered in mud than dust.

1179
01:22:35,960 --> 01:22:38,920
Before, I had been just one of many.

1180
01:22:38,920 --> 01:22:43,470
Now I was one of the few - an Indian man amongst
the British.

1181
01:22:43,470 --> 01:22:47,720
I was a long way from home and each day was
a challenge.

1182
01:22:47,720 --> 01:22:52,440
I spent many lonely days studying my law books.

1183
01:22:52,440 --> 01:22:56,160
Law to me was not just about what was legally
right or wrong.

1184
01:22:56,160 --> 01:23:01,400
I also wanted it to help people behave in
a way that was socially acceptable and this

1185
01:23:01,400 --> 01:23:05,050
meant looking at the principles behind the
law.

1186
01:23:05,050 --> 01:23:10,150
My early life in Porbandar influenced me greatly,
as the Jainist principles I had brought with

1187
01:23:10,150 --> 01:23:13,770
me guided me both in my studies and my social
life.

1188
01:23:13,770 --> 01:23:19,410
One of the battles everyone has to face is
how to beat their own inner enemies, such

1189
01:23:19,410 --> 01:23:23,020
as anger, intolerance and immorality.

1190
01:23:23,020 --> 01:23:28,400
I believed that self-control was important
and that taking responsibility for your own

1191
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:30,790
actions was essential.

1192
01:23:30,790 --> 01:23:35,540
It was no use blaming someone else for your
own bad behaviour or lack of will-power.

1193
01:23:35,540 --> 01:23:42,880
Where I came from, these beliefs guided poor
and rich alike but in London I found many

1194
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:44,570
different views.

1195
01:23:44,570 --> 01:23:49,960
It was not Jainism that was being debated
but capitalism and communism, or democracy

1196
01:23:49,960 --> 01:23:55,800
and theocracy and I found it fascinating to
be exposed to so many new ideas.

1197
01:23:55,800 --> 01:24:01,880
However, no matter what I heard, I held strongly
to my beliefs and managed to resist all the

1198
01:24:01,880 --> 01:24:04,860
temptations facing a young man in the city.

1199
01:24:04,860 --> 01:24:11,000
In 1891, I graduated from university and was
called to the Bar.

1200
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:16,470
I thought it was a strange expression, as
if one was going to be served drinks but in

1201
01:24:16,470 --> 01:24:22,250
reality, it meant that I had become a qualified
barrister and could now represent people in

1202
01:24:22,250 --> 01:24:26,910
the law courts.

1203
01:24:26,910 --> 01:24:27,910
***

1204
01:24:27,910 --> 01:24:35,780
Two days after my graduation, on 12th June
1891, I set sail for India.

1205
01:24:35,780 --> 01:24:41,751
On arriving, instead of the joy I had been
expecting at coming home, I was told my mother

1206
01:24:41,751 --> 01:24:45,730
had died.

1207
01:24:45,730 --> 01:24:52,040
Days of sadness were followed by hard times
financially as I tried to care for my family.

1208
01:24:52,040 --> 01:24:57,040
I set up a law practice in Mumbai but the
lack of clients meant that I soon had to close

1209
01:24:57,040 --> 01:24:58,390
it down.

1210
01:24:58,390 --> 01:25:04,500
I decided to apply for a job as a school teacher
but I was unlucky there, too, and my application

1211
01:25:04,500 --> 01:25:06,520
was rejected.

1212
01:25:06,520 --> 01:25:13,600
In 1893,1 accepted a one-year contract in
the British colony of Natal in South Africa.

1213
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:18,660
It was a relief to have some paid work but
frustration took its place as I experienced

1214
01:25:18,660 --> 01:25:21,640
countless acts of discrimination.

1215
01:25:21,640 --> 01:25:23,540
This is one example.

1216
01:25:23,540 --> 01:25:28,351
One day I was travelling, quite legally, in
the first-class carriage of a train, when

1217
01:25:28,351 --> 01:25:32,310
I was told by a guard to go and sit in third
class.

1218
01:25:32,310 --> 01:25:36,960
When I refused to move, I was actually thrown
off the train.

1219
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:42,370
My Jainist beliefs of tolerance for all people
told me that action against prejudice was

1220
01:25:42,370 --> 01:25:43,720
required.

1221
01:25:43,720 --> 01:25:48,410
Realizing that the law was not enough to protect
one's rights, I knew I had to do something

1222
01:25:48,410 --> 01:25:50,140
myself.

1223
01:25:50,140 --> 01:25:51,140
***

1224
01:25:51,140 --> 01:25:54,770
I decided to stay and campaign for civil rights
for minority groups.

1225
01:25:54,770 --> 01:26:01,420
The Natal Indian Congress was formed in 1894,
providing the Indian community with a voice.

1226
01:26:01,420 --> 01:26:07,790
I persuaded my family to join me in South
Africa, but life there was not easy for us.

1227
01:26:07,790 --> 01:26:13,850
I had seen poverty, injustice and suffering
and my life-long aim was to bring about peace

1228
01:26:13,850 --> 01:26:16,490
and prosperity all over the world.

1229
01:26:16,490 --> 01:26:22,400
However, in South Africa it seemed a very
long way away - for example, Indian marriages

1230
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:23,400
had been declared illegal.

1231
01:26:23,400 --> 01:26:31,780
In 1908, I was arrested for leading resistance
and spent two months in prison, which strengthened

1232
01:26:31,780 --> 01:26:35,420
my determination to stand up for my beliefs.

1233
01:26:35,420 --> 01:26:39,470
On the streets, prejudice against Indians
remained.

1234
01:26:39,470 --> 01:26:46,160
In 1913, I led 2,500 Indians in a protest
and once again, I was arrested and put in

1235
01:26:46,160 --> 01:26:48,020
prison.

1236
01:26:48,020 --> 01:26:55,490
In Europe the First World War had begun, with
more violence and destruction than had ever

1237
01:26:55,490 --> 01:26:57,030
been seen before.

1238
01:26:57,030 --> 01:27:02,350
I was worried that such a conflict could happen
in India.

1239
01:27:02,350 --> 01:27:09,060
I wanted to help our nation develop in a peaceful
way, which I called Ahimsa, but I didn't know

1240
01:27:09,060 --> 01:27:11,290
what role I could play.

1241
01:27:11,290 --> 01:27:14,290
South Africa was burning with racial conflict.

1242
01:27:14,290 --> 01:27:20,930
We had children born in a country where Indians,
an Asian minority, were always seen as immigrants.

1243
01:27:20,930 --> 01:27:26,400
However, the Indian population was caught
in the middle of a larger battle - the tribal

1244
01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:30,210
groups fighting against the British and Dutch
settlers.

1245
01:27:30,210 --> 01:27:35,130
I wondered if I should be using my talents
in my own country.

1246
01:27:35,130 --> 01:27:40,240
After twenty-one years in South Africa, it
was time to return to India.

1247
01:27:40,240 --> 01:27:44,800
Aged 45, I took my family home.

1248
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:45,800
***

1249
01:27:45,800 --> 01:27:52,210
In India, we had the same issues of prejudice.

1250
01:27:52,210 --> 01:27:57,650
Indians were subservient to the British and
we were a divided nation under the Raj.

1251
01:27:57,650 --> 01:28:03,070
We were also divided between Hindus, Muslims
and other religions.

1252
01:28:03,070 --> 01:28:09,260
My family and followers needed support and
so I set up a farm, a place for them to go,

1253
01:28:09,260 --> 01:28:12,020
called Sabarmati Ashram.

1254
01:28:12,020 --> 01:28:17,210
I believed that Indians, not the British,
should rule India, and my political campaign

1255
01:28:17,210 --> 01:28:24,510
for independence began when I spoke at the
Indian National Congress.

1256
01:28:24,510 --> 01:28:30,090
The turning point in my campaign happened
when I visited a place called Champaran.

1257
01:28:30,090 --> 01:28:35,340
Here my goal was to help poor farm workers
working for British landlords.

1258
01:28:35,340 --> 01:28:42,210
The British ordered me to leave, but I refused
and told the workers to hold non-violent protests.

1259
01:28:42,210 --> 01:28:43,350
I was arrested.

1260
01:28:43,350 --> 01:28:48,990
Hundreds of thousands of people marched in
mass protests and eventually, the law was

1261
01:28:48,990 --> 01:28:52,760
changed, giving the farm workers more control.

1262
01:28:52,760 --> 01:28:56,340
The 'satyagraha' non-violent approach had
worked.

1263
01:28:56,340 --> 01:29:01,240
News of the success spread through cities,
towns and villages but the prejudice and violence

1264
01:29:01,240 --> 01:29:02,430
did not stop.

1265
01:29:02,430 --> 01:29:08,490
In 1919 in Amritsar, the Jallianwala Bagh
massacre happened.

1266
01:29:08,490 --> 01:29:15,240
379 people were murdered and over 1,000 wounded,
and I realized that self-government for India

1267
01:29:15,240 --> 01:29:19,480
was essential.

1268
01:29:19,480 --> 01:29:25,760
By 1920, I was the president of the All India
Home Rule League and our cry was 'Independence

1269
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:27,170
from the British Empire'.

1270
01:29:27,170 --> 01:29:35,130
In 1921, the 'swadeshi policy' was introduced
where we decided not to buy foreign goods,

1271
01:29:35,130 --> 01:29:37,350
particularly cloth from Britain.

1272
01:29:37,350 --> 01:29:43,320
Other protests were organized to raise political
awareness but it was a long, slow and difficult

1273
01:29:43,320 --> 01:29:44,980
process.

1274
01:29:44,980 --> 01:29:48,810
Those in power were reluctant to admit defeat.

1275
01:29:48,810 --> 01:29:54,380
Month after month, I travelled across India,
encouraging people to protest.

1276
01:29:54,380 --> 01:30:00,840
I was arrested and put in prison for two years
for trying to make people disobey the government.

1277
01:30:00,840 --> 01:30:07,360
No prison is pleasant but the conditions there
were truly terrible.

1278
01:30:07,360 --> 01:30:13,070
Despite this, they could not break my spirit
and on my release, I became president of the

1279
01:30:13,070 --> 01:30:17,960
Indian National Congress (the INC).

1280
01:30:17,960 --> 01:30:24,460
Support for our cause was growing and on 30th
January 1930, I published the Declaration

1281
01:30:24,460 --> 01:30:27,460
of Independence of India.

1282
01:30:27,460 --> 01:30:32,810
I had not forgotten the bitter war that took
place when the Americans made their own declaration

1283
01:30:32,810 --> 01:30:36,840
of independence from Britain all those years
before.

1284
01:30:36,840 --> 01:30:39,180
I decided on non-violent action.

1285
01:30:39,180 --> 01:30:47,900
On 12th March, I led a 385 kilometre march
to the Gujarat coast in the west of the country.

1286
01:30:47,900 --> 01:30:54,410
Here I committed an 'act of defiance' against
the British, who had a monopoly of the salt

1287
01:30:54,410 --> 01:30:55,410
production.

1288
01:30:55,410 --> 01:30:57,630
I made salt from sea water.

1289
01:30:57,630 --> 01:31:03,210
I was arrested for this 'crime' and immediately
non-violent protest broke out across India,

1290
01:31:03,210 --> 01:31:06,950
and thousands of Indians were imprisoned.

1291
01:31:06,950 --> 01:31:12,440
News of this had spread across the world and
the leader of the British in India, Lord Irwin,

1292
01:31:12,440 --> 01:31:14,340
wanted satyagraha to end.

1293
01:31:14,340 --> 01:31:18,820
I was released from prison and I promised
to give up the satyagraha salt campaign on

1294
01:31:18,820 --> 01:31:21,260
three conditions.

1295
01:31:21,260 --> 01:31:26,160
The first was the release of those who had
been imprisoned, the second was to allow Indians

1296
01:31:26,160 --> 01:31:28,760
to make their own salt.

1297
01:31:28,760 --> 01:31:35,400
The third was for the INC to be invited to
the 1931 Round Table talks in London, where

1298
01:31:35,400 --> 01:31:38,210
the future of India was to be discussed.

1299
01:31:38,210 --> 01:31:45,160
Irwin agreed and on 5th March 1931 we signed
the Gandhi-Irwin agreement.

1300
01:31:45,160 --> 01:31:49,800
I felt that the people of Britain needed to
know more about our cause.

1301
01:31:49,800 --> 01:31:56,250
While I was in England in 1931 attending the
Round Table talks, I was invited by the Davies

1302
01:31:56,250 --> 01:32:02,020
family, who owned several mills, to meet the
mill workers in the north of England.

1303
01:32:02,020 --> 01:32:06,770
The mills were the factories that made cloth
and many mill workers had lost their jobs

1304
01:32:06,770 --> 01:32:10,050
when India stopped buying British cloth.

1305
01:32:10,050 --> 01:32:15,910
The Davies family wanted me to see the hardship
that the now unemployed workers were experiencing.

1306
01:32:15,910 --> 01:32:21,720
I understood their difficulties and I tried
to be sympathetic, but I wanted to make them

1307
01:32:21,720 --> 01:32:25,800
understand how much worse living conditions
were for the Indians.

1308
01:32:25,800 --> 01:32:29,090
I hope I made an impression on them.

1309
01:32:29,090 --> 01:32:35,270
In 1932 I started another major protest against
British rule.

1310
01:32:35,270 --> 01:32:41,250
This time it was on behalf of India's disadvantaged
lowest caste, the Dalits, better known as

1311
01:32:41,250 --> 01:32:42,270
the 'untouchables'.

1312
01:32:42,270 --> 01:32:47,570
I preferred to call them Harijans - 'God's
Children'.

1313
01:32:47,570 --> 01:32:52,510
The British rulers were planning a new political
system that would increase discrimination

1314
01:32:52,510 --> 01:32:56,670
against the Dalits, and would damage Hindu
society.

1315
01:32:56,670 --> 01:32:59,570
To gain attention, I refused to eat.

1316
01:32:59,570 --> 01:33:03,530
To no one's surprise, I was again thrown into
prison.

1317
01:33:03,530 --> 01:33:09,880
Although I was furious, I kept to my principle
of non-violence and I still refused to eat.

1318
01:33:09,880 --> 01:33:14,980
After six days of fasting, it was agreed that
the new system would not be introduced, and

1319
01:33:14,980 --> 01:33:19,480
it seemed that our non-violent protest was
again having an effect.

1320
01:33:19,480 --> 01:33:20,480
***

1321
01:33:20,480 --> 01:33:25,630
There was, however, still much to protest
about and I spoke at many meetings.

1322
01:33:25,630 --> 01:33:29,450
The British officials objected and they arrested
me again.

1323
01:33:29,450 --> 01:33:33,920
Had they learnt nothing from the loss of their
American colonies?

1324
01:33:33,920 --> 01:33:38,690
How could such well-educated men act in such
stupid ways?

1325
01:33:38,690 --> 01:33:41,590
More long days were wasted in prison.

1326
01:33:41,590 --> 01:33:45,990
As a lawyer, I knew the law but what good
did it do me?

1327
01:33:45,990 --> 01:33:50,740
On my release, I was 63 years old and it was
time to travel.

1328
01:33:50,740 --> 01:33:54,570
Over the next four years, I toured rural communities.

1329
01:33:54,570 --> 01:33:59,880
The poverty was depressing, but the spirits
of the people uplifted me and gave me new

1330
01:33:59,880 --> 01:34:00,880
energy.

1331
01:34:00,880 --> 01:34:08,370
However, far away, there was more conflict
as the Second World War had begun.

1332
01:34:08,370 --> 01:34:14,080
As India was a British colony it became involved
in the war, with many fine men going into

1333
01:34:14,080 --> 01:34:15,220
battle.

1334
01:34:15,220 --> 01:34:19,480
My principles of non-violence were tested
to the full.

1335
01:34:19,480 --> 01:34:24,590
Could one be a pacifist when mass murder was
being committed?

1336
01:34:24,590 --> 01:34:29,560
If it had been Jains instead of Jews being
gassed, could I have stood by?

1337
01:34:29,560 --> 01:34:35,850
The reality of Nazism and the death camps
made me think about pacifism.

1338
01:34:35,850 --> 01:34:41,690
The major aim of the Indian National Congress
was for India to be free of British rule but

1339
01:34:41,690 --> 01:34:45,210
we also wanted the country to remain united.

1340
01:34:45,210 --> 01:34:50,200
For a long time there had been violent racial
conflict between Hindus and Muslims.

1341
01:34:50,200 --> 01:34:56,050
The Muslims had their own organization, the
Muslim League, which wanted India to be divided

1342
01:34:56,050 --> 01:34:59,910
so that there could be an independent Muslim
state.

1343
01:34:59,910 --> 01:35:03,010
This was something that the British also supported.

1344
01:35:03,010 --> 01:35:09,590
In 1942 I led a movement called 'Quit India',
calling for immediate independence and I was

1345
01:35:09,590 --> 01:35:10,590
arrested.

1346
01:35:10,590 --> 01:35:16,260
In the meantime, the Muslim League promised
the British that the Indian army, whose soldiers

1347
01:35:16,260 --> 01:35:19,600
were mainly Muslim, would continue to fight
with them.

1348
01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:23,690
This promise was on the understanding that
two things would happen.

1349
01:35:23,690 --> 01:35:29,350
Firstly, negotiations would begin for the
British to leave India, and secondly, before

1350
01:35:29,350 --> 01:35:34,880
they left, they would divide India to create
an independent Muslim state.

1351
01:35:34,880 --> 01:35:40,640
In the summer of 1947, Indian independence
from the British was declared.

1352
01:35:40,640 --> 01:35:47,280
This was on the day after the British created
the Muslim state of Pakistan, dividing India.

1353
01:35:47,280 --> 01:35:53,560
My wife did not live to see the independence
of India as she died in 1944.

1354
01:35:53,560 --> 01:35:59,450
I am sure she hadn't realized what marriage
to me meant - at the age of thirteen I did

1355
01:35:59,450 --> 01:36:03,490
not know myself what I was going to do with
my life.

1356
01:36:03,490 --> 01:36:09,030
In truth, I was more married to the causes
I was following than to her, but whether she

1357
01:36:09,030 --> 01:36:13,200
knew it or not, her support kept me going.

1358
01:36:13,200 --> 01:36:18,940
Four years later, my spirit was also set free
when I was assassinated at a prayer meeting.

1359
01:36:18,940 --> 01:36:25,490
Ironically, it was not the British or the
Pakistanis that fired the gun, both of whom

1360
01:36:25,490 --> 01:36:26,935
had their reasons for killing me, but a Hindu
nationalist.

1361
01:36:26,935 --> 01:36:27,935
The Life of Mahatma Gandhi

1362
01:36:27,935 --> 01:36:28,935
1869 Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was born in
Porbandar, Gujarat, British India.

1363
01:36:28,935 --> 01:36:29,935
Later in life, he was referred to as Mahatma,
meaning 'great soul'.

1364
01:36:29,935 --> 01:36:30,935
1876 The family moved to Kajkot.

1365
01:36:30,935 --> 01:36:31,935
1883 At the age of 13, Gandhi married Kasturba
Makhanji, in an arranged marriage.

1366
01:36:31,935 --> 01:36:32,935
1885 The couple's first child was born, but
died a few days later.

1367
01:36:32,935 --> 01:36:33,935
1888 Gandhi went to England to study law at
University College London.

1368
01:36:33,935 --> 01:36:34,935
He joined the Vegetarian Society and developed
an interest in religious thought.

1369
01:36:34,935 --> 01:36:35,935
1891 He passed the bar examination for lawyers
in London.

1370
01:36:35,935 --> 01:36:36,935
He then returned to India to discover his
mother had died.

1371
01:36:36,935 --> 01:36:37,935
He opened a law practice, which was unsuccessful.

1372
01:36:37,935 --> 01:36:38,935
1893 Gandhi accepted a one-year contract from
an Indian firm to travel to South Africa and

1373
01:36:38,935 --> 01:36:39,935
work as a lawyer.

1374
01:36:39,935 --> 01:36:40,935
1894 He helped set up the Natal Indian Congress
and started to campaign for Indian rights.

1375
01:36:40,935 --> 01:36:41,935
1896 Gandhi returned to India and took his
family back to South Africa.

1376
01:36:41,935 --> 01:36:42,935
1901-1902 Gandhi returned to India to attend
the Indian National Congress, where he met

1377
01:36:42,935 --> 01:36:43,935
nationalist leaders.

1378
01:36:43,935 --> 01:36:44,935
He also opened a law firm in Mumbai.

1379
01:36:44,935 --> 01:36:45,935
1903 He opened a law office in Johannesburg.

1380
01:36:45,935 --> 01:36:46,935
1906 He led a protest against anti-Indian
laws.

1381
01:36:46,935 --> 01:36:47,935
1907 The Transvaal Government bought in a
new Act forcing registration of the Indian

1382
01:36:47,935 --> 01:36:48,935
population.

1383
01:36:48,935 --> 01:36:49,935
1908 Gandhi led a mass non-violent protest
using his method of satyagraha (devotion to

1384
01:36:49,935 --> 01:36:50,935
the truth).

1385
01:36:50,935 --> 01:36:51,935
Gandhi spent two months in prison.

1386
01:36:51,935 --> 01:36:52,935
1909 He wrote a book, Hind Swaraj, or Home
Rule, as it was called in English.

1387
01:36:52,935 --> 01:36:53,935
This was the blueprint for the Indian Independence
Movement.

1388
01:36:53,935 --> 01:36:54,935
1913 Gandhi led 2,500 Indian miners in a protest.

1389
01:36:54,935 --> 01:36:55,935
He was arrested and put in prison.

1390
01:36:55,935 --> 01:36:56,935
1914 Aged 45, he left South Africa and planned
to return to India, after making a short stopover

1391
01:36:56,935 --> 01:36:57,935
in England.

1392
01:36:57,935 --> 01:36:58,935
While he was travelling home, the First World
War broke out.

1393
01:36:58,935 --> 01:36:59,935
1915 Gandhi left England and returned to India.

1394
01:36:59,935 --> 01:37:00,935
He was welcomed as a hero.

1395
01:37:00,935 --> 01:37:01,935
He joined the Indian National Congress.

1396
01:37:01,935 --> 01:37:02,935
As a form of protest, he began the first of
many fasts.

1397
01:37:02,935 --> 01:37:03,935
1918-1919 Gandhi used his satyagraha method
during the Champaran and Kheda protests.

1398
01:37:03,935 --> 01:37:04,935
The local farmers were being forced to grow
crops that they could not use themselves,

1399
01:37:04,935 --> 01:37:05,935
but that were to be sold, and were being highly
taxed.

1400
01:37:05,935 --> 01:37:06,935
Gandhi also became a high-profile spokesperson
for Muslims in the Khilafat movement.

1401
01:37:06,935 --> 01:37:07,935
1919 The Jallianwala Bagh massacre took place.

1402
01:37:07,935 --> 01:37:08,935
Gandhi led the first nationwide campaign against
Britain's unfair rule.

1403
01:37:08,935 --> 01:37:09,935
1921 Gandhi took on leadership of the India
National Congress.

1404
01:37:09,935 --> 01:37:10,935
1922 He led a non-cooperation movement and,
as a result, he was arrested and imprisoned

1405
01:37:10,935 --> 01:37:11,935
for two years.

1406
01:37:11,935 --> 01:37:12,935
1925-1929 He wrote a series of articles, later
called The Story of My Experiments with Truth.

1407
01:37:12,935 --> 01:37:13,935
1930 The Indian National Congress declared
the independence of India.

1408
01:37:13,935 --> 01:37:14,935
