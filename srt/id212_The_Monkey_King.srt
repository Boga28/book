CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:02,800
Monkey's Story

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:11,280
Monkey pulled out some hairs from his chest 
and, crying 'Change!' threw them into the air.  

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,920
At once, they became several 
hundred small monkeys.

5
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:23,520
From the beginning of time, the rock was 
smoothed and cleaned by Heaven and Earth,  

6
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:30,560
by the strong sun and the gentle moon, 
until one day it broke into two pieces  

7
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:39,760
and gave birth to a stone egg, about as big as a 
child's ball. From the egg came a stone monkey.

8
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:48,080
At once, this monkey learned to climb 
and run. But first, it looked north  

9
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:56,080
and south and east and west. As it looked, 
a strange light came from its eyes.

10
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:05,520
The light shone as far as the Jade Emperor, who 
sat in the Cloud Palace of the Golden Gates. The  

11
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:12,400
Jade Emperor asked his ministers to open the gate 
of the Southern Heaven and look out at the light.

12
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:21,440
'This light,' reported the ministers, 
'comes from the small country of Ao-lai,  

13
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,840
to the east of the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit.'

14
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:30,880
And in the country of Ao-lai, 
the monkey ran and jumped.  

15
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:37,200
He picked flowers, ate grass and fruit, 
and drank from streams and rivers.  

16
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:44,880
His friends were all the animals of that 
country, and the other monkeys were his family.  

17
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:54,320
At night, he slept among the rocks and 
in the day he walked through the caves.

18
00:01:54,320 --> 00:02:01,280
One day, the monkeys were washing in 
a stream when one of them spoke. 'None  

19
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:07,840
of us knows where this stream comes 
from. Let's follow it and find out.'

20
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:14,160
So they all ran up the stream until 
they came to a great waterfall.

21
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:23,680
The monkeys shouted, 'Lovely water, lovely 
water! It starts in a mountain cave and  

22
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:31,120
runs all the way to the Great Sea. Who can 
find the place where the water comes from?  

23
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:38,800
If one of us could find this place and 
return safely, we would make him our king!'

24
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:45,040
'I will go!' shouted the 
Stone Monkey. 'I will go!'

25
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:54,800
Look at him! He shuts his eyes, and with one 
big jump he passes through the curtain of water.  

26
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,640
But there is no water where he has landed.  

27
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:04,560
Instead he finds a great, shining 
iron bridge in front of him.

28
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:13,040
Monkey walked along the bridge and came to 
a cave. Outside the cave there was a sign:  

29
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:22,240
This Cave of the Water Curtain in the Country of 
the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit Leads to Heaven.

30
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,800
Monkey laughed and jumped with happiness.  

31
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:35,840
He ran back across the bridge, shut his eyes and 
jumped through the waterfall to the other monkeys.

32
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:43,120
'Good news!' he shouted. 'Good 
news! Come with me, all of you!'

33
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,960
They followed the Stone Monkey 
to the Cave of the Water Curtain.  

34
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,840
There the Stone Monkey sat 
down and talked to them.

35
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,840
'Gentlemen!' he said. 'I have 
been through the waterfall  

36
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:09,280
and have come back again. I have given you a 
home in this cave, so am I not your king now?'

37
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:18,000
The monkeys bowed to the Stone Monkey and they 
all cried, 'Great King for a thousand years!'  

38
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:28,160
The Stone Monkey became the Monkey King 
and he made other monkeys his ministers.

39
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:34,000
And all the monkeys were happy. During 
the day they walked and played on the  

40
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,600
Mountain of Flowers and Fruit, and 
at night they slept in the Cave  

41
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:46,880
of the Water Curtain. They had everything 
they wanted. Their lives were complete.

42
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,840
The Monkey King enjoyed this simple 
life for several hundred years.  

43
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:01,040
But one day at a great party with all the 
other monkeys, he suddenly started to cry.

44
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:07,760
The other monkeys all bowed, 
saying, 'Why is our king so sad?'

45
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:19,040
'Today,' said the Monkey King, 'I am not sad. 
But I am worried about the future. Sadly, the  

46
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:28,160
time will come when I will become old and weak. 
Yama, King of Death, is waiting to destroy me.  

47
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:37,840
I do not want to be born again on Earth. How can 
I live for all time among the people of the sky?'

48
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:48,720
The monkeys all started to cry, each thinking of 
his own mortality. One of them said, 'Only Buddhas  

49
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:55,600
and Immortals do not go to Yama, King 
of Death. Only they live forever.'

50
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,680
'Where can I find these 
Immortals?' asked the Monkey King.

51
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,600
'Here on Earth they live in 
very old caves far to the West.'

52
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:17,600
'Tomorrow,' said the Monkey King, 'I shall say 
goodbye to you. I shall go down the mountain and  

53
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:25,440
travel to the end of the world. I want to learn 
to live for all time and to escape from death.'

54
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:35,840
Next morning, he walked to the sea and sailed in 
a boat to the borders of the Southern World. There  

55
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:45,520
he climbed out on to the beach. And then he walked 
and walked, through towns and cities, to the West.

56
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:54,880
On the way, he learned to wear clothes and 
to behave like a human. But he met humans  

57
00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:01,840
who wanted only to be rich and famous. He 
met nobody who worried about his mortality.

58
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:11,680
One day, he came to the Western Ocean, where 
he built another boat. Then he sailed to the  

59
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:20,160
Western Continent, where he saw a very high 
and beautiful wooded mountain. At the top  

60
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:27,120
of the mountain was the Cave of the Moon and 
Three Stars, where the Immortal Subodhi lived.

61
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:33,200
Monkey at once bowed and touched the 
ground with his head three times.

62
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,560
'Where do you come from?' asked the Immortal.

63
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,160
'I am from the Cave of the Water Curtain,'  

64
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:47,200
said Monkey, 'on the Mountain of Flowers 
and Fruit in the country of Ao-lai.'

65
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,840
'That is impossible!' shouted the Immortal.  

66
00:07:52,480 --> 00:08:00,160
'Between there and here are two oceans and the 
whole of the Southern Continent. You are lying!'

67
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:06,240
'I have sailed across the oceans and 
walked over the continents for more  

68
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:11,840
than ten years,' said Monkey. 
'At last I have reached here.'

69
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,520
Monkey told the Immortal how 
he had come from a magic stone.  

70
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,600
The Immortal thought that Monkey was 
a natural product of Heaven and Earth,  

71
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:29,600
so he agreed to teach him. Monkey 
jumped up and down with happiness.

72
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:39,200
Day after day, he and the other students learned 
to speak and behave correctly. They learned to  

73
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:46,800
write well and to study the Scriptures. When they 
were not studying, the students grew flowers and  

74
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:55,520
trees. They lit fires and fetched water. And so 
Monkey lived in this way for six or seven years.

75
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,960
Finally, the Immortal sent 
for Monkey late one night  

76
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:04,880
because he wanted to teach 
him the Way of Long Life.

77
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:11,600
'Come close and listen 
carefully,' said the Immortal.

78
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:18,720
Monkey went down on his knees on the floor 
at the Immortal's feet, listening carefully.  

79
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:30,400
The Immortal recited a magic poem with many lines. 
The words shook Monkey's soul and he was never the  

80
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:38,880
same Monkey again. He thanked the Immortal many 
times, because now he knew the Way of Long Life.

81
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:48,080
Time passed quickly and three years later the 
Immortal again invited Monkey to his room,  

82
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:57,200
where he taught him seventy-two transformations. 
Monkey was a quick learner and he practised until  

83
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:03,840
he could change himself into something 
else, using all seventy-two ways.

84
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,840
One day, when the Immortal and his 
students were in front of the cave  

85
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:18,640
admiring the evening view, the Immortal spoke 
to Monkey. 'Monkey, how much have you learned?'

86
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:23,680
'Thanks to you,' said Monkey, 
'I have learned a lot.  

87
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:29,520
In addition to changing myself into 
other forms, I can already fly.'

88
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:34,480
'Let me see you do it,' said the Immortal.

89
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:42,240
Monkey put his feet together, jumped twenty 
metres into the air and rode the clouds for a  

90
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:49,280
few minutes. Then he dropped to the ground, 
saying, 'You see, I can ride the clouds.'

91
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:58,560
'That is not riding the clouds,' said the 
Immortal, laughing. 'A real cloud-rider  

92
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,760
can start in the morning from the Northern Sea,  

93
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:10,000
cross the Eastern, the Western and the 
Southern Seas and land again in one day.'

94
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,320
'It sounds very difficult,' said Monkey.

95
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:22,880
'Nothing in the world is difficult,' said the 
Immortal. 'Only our own thoughts make things  

96
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:30,720
seem difficult. Now I will teach you 
to fly from one continent to another.'

97
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,600
The other students laughed, saying, 
'If Monkey flies all that way,  

98
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,920
he will be able to earn a living as a postman.'

99
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:46,000
But Monkey spent all night practising 
what the Immortal had taught him.

100
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,880
By morning he could fly wherever he wanted.

101
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,720
One summer day, some students 
were sitting under a tree.  

102
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:04,320
A student said, 'Monkey, why do you 
deserve private teaching by the Immortal?  

103
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:09,840
Has he taught you the transformations, 
by all the seventy-two ways?'

104
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:16,720
'I have been working on them day and night 
and now I can do them all,' said Monkey.

105
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,800
'Could you show us?'

106
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:28,800
Proudly, Monkey made a magic sign, said some 
magic words and transformed himself into a tree.

107
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:36,560
'Well done, Monkey, well done!' shouted 
the other students. They all laughed.

108
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:42,240
The Immortal heard their laughter and 
he came running out from the cave.

109
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,760
'Who is making all this noise?' he asked.

110
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:55,680
Monkey changed himself back from a tree to 
a monkey. He sat with the students again  

111
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:00,240
and said, 'Immortal, we are 
practising our lessons out here.'

112
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:08,320
'You were all shouting and laughing!' said 
the Immortal, angrily. 'I want to know why.'

113
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:16,960
Then one student said, 'Monkey was transforming 
himself into a tree, just for fun.'

114
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:23,440
'You, Monkey, come here!' shouted the Immortal.  

115
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:31,440
'Why do you think I taught you these secrets 
of life? So you can make other people laugh?'

116
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,000
'I am very sorry,' said Monkey.

117
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:45,840
'I will not punish you,' said the Immortal. 
'But you cannot stay here. You must leave us.'

118
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:52,400
Monkey started to cry. 'Where can I go?' he asked.

119
00:13:53,760 --> 00:14:01,120
'Go back to where you came from. Go as 
quickly as you can. Never tell anyone  

120
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:07,600
that you were a student of mine. I am 
sure that no good will come of your life.'

121
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:17,440
And so poor Monkey said goodbye to everybody. 
He flew back to the Eastern Sea and his home  

122
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,440
in the Cave of the Water Curtain on 
the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit.

123
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:27,920
'Little ones,' shouted the 
Monkey King, 'I have come back!'

124
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:36,880
At once, big and small monkeys leapt out of 
trees with cries of 'Long live our King!'  

125
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:44,800
Then, pushing each other to get near him, 
they cried, 'Why did you go for so long?  

126
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:52,080
We have been watching for your return day 
after day! While you were away, a demon took  

127
00:14:52,080 --> 00:15:00,720
our cave and everything we own and many of our 
children. Now we dare not sleep, night or day.'

128
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:08,480
'What demon dares to do this?' 
cried Monkey. 'I will make him pay!'

129
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,880
'King, he is called the Destroying Demon,  

130
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:20,240
and he lives north of here. But he 
comes and goes like a cloud, like wind,  

131
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:27,600
like rain, like thunder and lightning, so we 
do not know where his home is or how far away.'

132
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:33,920
'Well, don't worry,' said Monkey. 
'I will go and look for him.'

133
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:43,440
Dear Monkey! He leapt into the sky and 
soon saw in front of him a high mountain  

134
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,600
and a cave, where the Destroying 
Demon was waiting for him.

135
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:54,240
'Where is the owner of the Cave of 
the Water Curtain?' cried the Demon.

136
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:02,080
'You have such large eyes,' shouted 
Monkey, 'but you cannot see Monkey?'

137
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,320
'Oh! You are not half a metre high!  

138
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:12,400
If I killed such a small creature 
with my sword, I would look foolish.'

139
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:20,960
So the two of them fought with their hands and 
feet, hitting and kicking each other. Soon the  

140
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:29,440
Demon was fighting like a wild animal. Monkey 
pulled out some hairs from his chest and, crying  

141
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:37,280
'Change!' threw them into the air. At once, 
they became several hundred small monkeys.

142
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,880
See how the monkeys jump on the 
Demon, pulling and hitting him.  

143
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:51,280
Then Monkey takes up the Demon's great sword and 
brings it down on his head, breaking it in two.  

144
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:58,400
Then, by his magic, he transforms 
all the monkeys back into hairs.

145
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,880
When Monkey returned home to the cave 
on the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit,  

146
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,640
he brought the great sword 
of the Destroying Demon,  

147
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:14,320
and he amused the other monkeys by 
teaching them to make weapons of wood.

148
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:20,960
Then, one day, the Monkey King 
called all the other monkeys to him.

149
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,320
'All this,' he said, pointing 
to their wooden weapons,  

150
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:33,120
'is only a game. We cannot defend 
ourselves from a real enemy with these.'

151
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:42,000
'We know a city that is full of soldiers. They 
must have plenty of weapons,' the others said.  

152
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,840
They quickly told Monkey where it was.

153
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:52,480
'Stay here and amuse yourselves,' 
Monkey said. 'I will see what I can do.'  

154
00:17:54,320 --> 00:18:03,280
Dear Monkey! Using his magic, he flew to the city 
and, with his breath, blew such a strong wind that  

155
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:11,200
all the people locked themselves indoors. This was 
his chance. He found where the weapons were kept,  

156
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:19,200
kicked down the door, and changed his hairs into 
thousands of small monkeys who took the weapons.  

157
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,560
Carried on a magic wind, they 
were soon back at the cave.

158
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,640
The monkeys learned to use the weapons,  

159
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:36,400
and all sorts of wild animals and demon 
kings began to call Monkey their king.

160
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,840
But Monkey found his own weapon too heavy,  

161
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:50,720
so he went to the Dragon of the Eastern Sea in 
search of something lighter. The Dragon King  

162
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:57,840
welcomed him to the palace, with his dragon 
children, dragon grandchildren and fish soldiers.

163
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:05,920
Monkey made his request, and a fish 
soldier brought out a great sword.

164
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,840
'Too heavy,' said Monkey.

165
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,880
More fish soldiers brought out an enormous fork.

166
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,720
'Too light,' said Monkey.

167
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,160
The dragon mother and her daughter  

168
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:28,160
came from a back room in the palace 
and suggested their magic iron cudgel.

169
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,440
'The Gods used it when they 
decided how deep the rivers  

170
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:39,680
and the seas should be,' said the Dragon 
King. He agreed that Monkey should have it.

171
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:46,560
When it was brought, Monkey saw that it 
was a thick piece of iron six metres long.  

172
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:52,240
He used his magic to bring 
it down to less than a metre.  

173
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:57,680
Then he waved it over his head, striking 
terror into everybody in the room.

174
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,440
But now he demanded something 
to wear, to go with the weapon,  

175
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:14,720
and this was too much. A pair of cloud-stepping 
shoes, a cap of red gold and a coat of light metal  

176
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:22,160
were brought to him, but the angry Dragon King 
also sent for his brothers from the Southern,  

177
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:27,600
Northern and Western Seas and told 
them about Monkey's many requests.

178
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:35,200
The Dragon of the South was angry. 
'Put him in prison!' he cried.

179
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,800
'No, no,' warned the Dragon King.  

180
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:46,320
'We cannot go near him now. If he touches 
us with that iron cudgel, he will kill us.  

181
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:54,960
Let him keep the clothes. We will complain 
to Heaven, and Heaven will punish him.'

182
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:02,240
Monkey took the clothes, but he knew that 
they were going to complain about him.

183
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:10,720
Soon after that, the Jade Emperor received the 
complaint from the Dragon of the Eastern Sea.

184
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,560
'How long,' the Jade Emperor asked his ministers,  

185
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:22,720
'has this Monkey existed, and why 
does he behave like an Immortal?'

186
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:31,840
'In the last three hundred years, he has 
learned a lot,' said a minister. 'Let's  

187
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:36,640
give him work here in Heaven where 
we will be able to watch hint.'

188
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:43,840
This suggestion pleased the Jade Emperor, and 
a minister was sent to bring Monkey to Heaven.  

189
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:50,800
Monkey tidied his clothes, told the older 
monkeys to look after the younger ones,  

190
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,880
and followed the minister to Heaven.

191
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:59,520
'I am going to give you a job,' 
said the Jade Emperor to Monkey.  

192
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,520
'You are going to look after the Apple Garden.'

193
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:13,280
Monkey was very happy and ran to the Apple Garden 
to start work. He was told that on the outer side  

194
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:20,480
of the garden were special apples. They were 
ready to eat once in three thousand years.  

195
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:28,960
If you ate one of these, you would become wise, 
with strong arms and legs and a light body.  

196
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:37,440
In the middle were trees with apples that 
were ready to eat once in six thousand years.  

197
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:44,880
If you ate these, you would go up in the air 
and stay there, and would never grow old.  

198
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:53,840
At the back were trees with apples chat were 
ready to eat once in nine thousand years.  

199
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:59,920
If you ate these, you would live 
longer than Heaven and Earth.

200
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,320
Monkey was very happy with this information.  

201
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:12,240
He watched the trees closely, making up his mind 
to eat the fruit before anybody else got a chance.

202
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:19,760
Soon, noticing that some apples were 
ready to eat, he sent his helpers away.

203
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:26,240
He climbed into a high tree and 
ate until he could eat no more.

204
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
When the Queen of Heaven sent 
her lady assistants for apples,  

205
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,840
they were turned away at the 
gates by Monkey's helpers.  

206
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:43,040
'We must ask the Monkey King first,' they 
said. 'He is resting in one of the trees.'

207
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:51,840
But when they came to the tree, they found only 
Monkey's cap and shoes. They could not see him.  

208
00:23:53,040 --> 00:24:00,560
In fact, Monkey had made himself five 
centimetres long and was asleep under a leaf.

209
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:09,040
The Queen of Heaven's lady assistants picked three 
basketfuls from each of the first two groups of  

210
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:18,000
trees. When they came to the third, they found 
just one apple. When one of the ladies tried to  

211
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,440
pick it, Monkey woke up. At once, 
he changed back to his true size.

212
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:27,040
'Who are you?' shouted Monkey.

213
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:33,840
The lady assistants went down on their 
knees. 'Monkey King, don't be angry.  

214
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:40,240
We were sent by the Queen and we could 
not find you. Please forgive us.'

215
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:48,640
'Get up from your knees,' said Monkey, 
his voice full of kindness. 'I have  

216
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:54,800
heard that the Queen of Heaven is having a 
banquet. Can you tell me who is invited?'

217
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:02,960
Monkey was told that all the Immortals, 
Emperors of the Four Quarters and Gods  

218
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:09,840
of the seas and hills would be there. He 
immediately asked, 'Will I be invited?'

219
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:17,200
'I have not heard,' said one of the 
lady assistants. 'We do not know.'

220
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:24,400
'Quite right, ladies,' said Monkey. 
'Just wait here while I go and see.'

221
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:32,640
Dear Monkey! He recited some 
magic lines, crying 'Stay, stay,  

222
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:41,840
stay!' The lady assistants were suddenly unable 
to move while he went off on his magic cloud.

223
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:48,880
No one had arrived at the banquet yet, 
but Monkey could smell the food and wine.  

224
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:56,640
He sent the servants to sleep by magic. Look 
at them, how their hands fall to their sides,  

225
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:06,560
their heads drop on to their chests, their 
eyes close! Monkey then took some of the  

226
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:14,320
finest and best of the food and drank glass 
after glass of wine until he was quite drunk.

227
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,960
'Bad! Bad!'  

228
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:28,960
he thought to himself. 'I will certainly get 
into trouble, so I will go home and sleep.'

229
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,160
But it was too late for that.

230
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:37,840
Back at the Apple Garden, the 
Queen's ladies were finally saved.  

231
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:45,040
They reported that the Monkey King had eaten many 
of the biggest apples and had now disappeared.

232
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:54,960
When the great Goddess Kuan-yin arrived for 
the banquet, she found half the food eaten and  

233
00:26:54,960 --> 00:27:01,920
all the wine gone. When the servants were 
woken, they explained that the Monkey King  

234
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:07,520
had sent them to sleep. That was the last 
time they had seen the food and the wine.  

235
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:14,160
The Jade Emperor was informed and he 
sent heavenly soldiers to find Monkey.

236
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:21,920
Monkey was burned in fire for nine 
days, and at the end of it his  

237
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:29,040
eyes were red but he was still alive. He 
was attacked with swords and the Gods of  

238
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:33,840
Thunder threw thunder at him. 
But nothing could destroy him.

239
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:42,720
In the end, hearing of this situation, the great 
Buddha himself arrived and called Monkey to him.  

240
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:51,600
'How long ago,' he asked him, 'did you 
try to become an Immortal and learn  

241
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:55,280
the things that make you dare behave like this?'

242
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,960
Monkey at once recited:

243
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:03,920
Born of Earth and Sky, I am a magic Immortal.

244
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,000
I am an old monkey from the 
Mountain of Flowers and Fruit;

245
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:13,120
In the Cave of the Water Curtain, 
I work and laugh and play.

246
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:18,160
I found a friend and teacher 
who taught me the Great Secret;

247
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:23,200
I made myself perfect in the Ways of Immortality,

248
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,400
I learned transformations without limit or end,

249
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:32,000
I tired of the narrow world of 
men, and lived in the Jade Heaven.

250
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,400
But why should Heaven's 
palace have only one emperor?

251
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:42,240
On Earth king follows king, as 
the strong bow to the stronger.

252
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,400
Only a hero fights with the Gods of Gods.

253
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,920
That was what Monkey recited.  

254
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:59,600
Buddha laughed. 'But you are only a 
monkey-spirit,' he said. 'The Jade Emperor  

255
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:07,280
has been making himself perfect for countless 
years. How can you hope to take his place and  

256
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:15,920
become emperor yourself? You are only an animal 
that looks half human! Talk no more of this.'

257
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:23,760
'Why should he be emperor for all time? 
Tell him to go and to give me my chance,'  

258
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:31,920
said Monkey. 'That is all I ask. And if he will 
not, I will see that he never has any peace.'

259
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:39,440
'What magic have you got that would 
help you to take Heaven for yourself?'

260
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:46,320
'I have a lot of magic,' replied Monkey. 'I 
can jump through the clouds from continent  

261
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:51,120
to continent. Am I not good enough 
to live in the palaces of Heaven?'  

262
00:29:52,640 --> 00:30:02,480
Buddha said, 'If you are really so clever, you 
will sit here in my right hand and then jump off.  

263
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:11,760
If you succeed, you can become the Jade Emperor. 
But if you fail, you will go back to Earth  

264
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,400
and you will be punished for centuries.'

265
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:23,040
Monkey thought, 'This Buddha is a complete 
fool. How could I fail to jump off his hand!'

266
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:30,240
Buddha held out his hand, which 
looked about the size of a large leaf.  

267
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:35,840
Monkey took the magic iron cudgel 
that the Dragon King had given him,  

268
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:40,000
and that he had transformed into 
a stick the size of a needle.  

269
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:47,840
He put it behind his ear and then he jumped 
from the hand as far and as fast as he could.

270
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:54,000
He was flying very fast, but Buddha 
watched him with the eye of wisdom.  

271
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:59,280
Monkey came at last to five high pink towers.

272
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:08,080
'This must be the end of the world,' said 
Monkey to himself. 'Now I will return to Buddha,  

273
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:16,240
become emperor, and all Heaven will be mine. But 
I had better leave some sign that I was here.'

274
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:22,960
Pulling out a hair, he changed it 
into a writing-brush heavy with ink,  

275
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:31,840
and at the bottom of the middle tower he wrote: 
The great Monkey King reached this place.  

276
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:35,440
Then he jumped back to where he had come from.

277
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,880
Standing on Buddha's hand, he said,  

278
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:46,480
'I have gone and I have returned. You can 
tell the Jade Emperor that his job is mine.'

279
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:55,760
'You smelly creature,' said Buddha, 
'you have been on my hand all the time.'

280
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:02,400
'You are completely wrong,' said Monkey. 
'I travelled to the end of the world,  

281
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:09,120
saw five pink towers and wrote on one of them. 
Would you like me to take you and show you?'

282
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:14,720
'No need,' said Buddha. 'Just look down.'

283
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:21,280
Monkey looked down, with his eyes 
still red from the nine days of fire.

284
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:26,400
There, at the bottom of the 
middle finger of Buddha's hand,  

285
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:32,400
he saw the words "The great 
Monkey King reached this place."

286
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:39,760
Monkey could not speak and his 
red eyes opened wide in surprise.  

287
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:49,440
At last he said, 'Impossible! Impossible! I 
wrote that on a tower going high into the sky.  

288
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:56,800
How did it get on the Buddha's finger? 
It is magic! I shall go back to look!'

289
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:04,640
Dear Monkey! He was preparing to jump again 
when Buddha pushed him out of the Western  

290
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:12,720
Gate of Heaven. As he did, he changed 
his five fingers into Metal, Wood, Water,  

291
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:23,920
Fire and Earth. They became a mountain which 
pressed poor Monkey down with its great weight.

292
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:31,840
The name Mountain of Metal, Wood, Water, Fire and 
Earth was written on a large rock on the mountain.  

293
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:38,000
Under the mountain there was 
enough air for Monkey to breathe,  

294
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,400
but no opening which Monkey's head 
or hand could squeeze through.

295
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:49,680
Buddha then told a spirit to look after 
Monkey and give him food and drink.

296
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:58,480
'And when the days of his punishment are 
finished,' said Buddha, 'a man will come here  

297
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,000
and save him.'

298
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:11,200
Time passed, and then one day the Buddha said to 
his followers, 'I have noticed a lot of difference  

299
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:19,040
between the people who live in the four continents 
of the world. The people in the East are polite,  

300
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:28,320
peaceful and cheerful. People in the North 
are lazy and stupid, so do little harm.  

301
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:38,240
In our Western Continent, there is no killing, 
although there is little real wisdom. But in the  

302
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:47,840
South, they are greedy and murderous. A knowledge 
of the True Scriptures might improve them.'

303
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,560
'Do you have these Scriptures?' 
asked his followers.

304
00:34:53,760 --> 00:35:03,360
'Yes, three baskets of them,' said Buddha. 'One 
speaks of Heaven, another of Earth, and a third  

305
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:12,240
can save people from the Wrong Way. These are the 
path to perfection, the only gate to the True Way.  

306
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:22,080
But down in the real world, people are so stupid 
that they laugh at them. I need to find someone  

307
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:29,840
who will go to the Eastern land. There he might 
find a believer who could come here from China.

308
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,840
I would give this believer the Scriptures  

309
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:38,480
to take back to China and change 
the hearts of the people.'

310
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:45,600
The Goddess Kuan-yin came 
forward and bowed three times.

311
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:52,080
'I would like to go to the Eastern land 
and find someone to fetch the Scriptures.'

312
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:58,160
'Who would be better than you!' said Buddha.

313
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:01,440
So Kuan-yin called her bodyguard, Hui-yen,  

314
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:06,640
who carried a great iron cudgel, 
and they started at once.

315
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:14,240
After they had travelled a long way, 
they came to the River of Sands. There,  

316
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:20,560
a horribly ugly creature leapt out of the water 
and began a terrible fight with the bodyguard.

317
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:27,520
Suddenly, the creature stopped fighting, 
looked hard at the bodyguard and asked, 'Who  

318
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:34,800
dares to fight with me? Surely I have seen you 
before in the gardens of the Goddess Kuan-yin?'

319
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:41,440
'The Goddess herself is here, in 
front of you,' Hui-yen replied.

320
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:50,320
'I ask you to forgive me!' cried the creature. 
'I am not really the ugly creature that you see.  

321
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:56,960
I was given this horrible shape as a 
punishment for a crime that I did in Heaven.  

322
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:05,200
I was sent to the world below, where I am always 
hungry and I must attack travellers and eat them.'

323
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:10,800
'But you are adding new crimes 
on Earth to your crime in Heaven  

324
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,160
by killing people,' said the Goddess Kuan-yin.

325
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:19,280
'Why not come with us? If 
our journey is successful,  

326
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,800
you will be forgiven and 
allowed to return to Heaven.'

327
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:31,520
'I would gladly go back,' the creature 
answered. 'But I have eaten so many humans.  

328
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:37,760
Even now, nine heads are lying on 
the waters of the River of Sands.  

329
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:45,200
I have played games with them and I do not think 
I will be allowed back into Heaven after that.'

330
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:52,480
'Don't be silly,' she replied. 'Take 
the heads and hang them round your neck.

331
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:58,080
I shall make you a priest and 
give you the name "Sandy Priest".

332
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:06,240
Wait here and never again take a human life. 
You will see that a man will come this way.  

333
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:12,560
He will be looking for the Scriptures and a 
good use will be found for the nine heads.'

334
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:20,880
So the Goddess and her bodyguard continued 
their journey and came to a high mountain  

335
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:28,000
with a most horrible smell. A 
dirty, smelly, piglike creature  

336
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:34,240
leapt out and attacked Kuan-yin with a great 
fork and fought hard with her bodyguard.

337
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:39,600
For safety, Kuan-yin stood in the sky above them  

338
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:45,840
and then threw down flowers, which fell 
between the bodyguard's cudgel and the fork.

339
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:51,440
'Fighting with flowers?' cried the 
pig. 'What kind of priest are you?'

340
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:57,120
'The great Goddess Kuan-yin threw 
them down on us from her cloud,  

341
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:59,840
where she is standing,' replied the bodyguard.

342
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:07,600
At once, the pig bowed to the sky. 
'Forgive me, Goddess, forgive me!  

343
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:15,200
I am not really a pig at all. For a crime in 
Heaven, the Jade Emperor sent me down here.'

344
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:24,160
'This is a chance for you,' said Kuan-yin. 'We 
are on our way to China to look for a man who  

345
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:31,760
will collect the Scriptures. If you went with 
him to India, we would forgive all your crimes.'

346
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:37,120
'I will! I will!' the pig-like creature shouted.

347
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,960
So they gave him the name of Pigsy,  

348
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:45,840
and left him to watch for the pilgrim 
who would collect the Scriptures.

349
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,720
The Goddess and her bodyguard went on their way  

350
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:55,840
and soon they met a dragon who 
had fought against the Gods.

351
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:00,080
'Can you help me?' the dragon cried out.

352
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:06,800
Kuan-yin went back to Heaven. She 
asked the Gods to forgive the dragon  

353
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:12,800
if he would transform himself into a white 
horse and carry the pilgrim to India.

354
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:18,560
Continuing their journey, 
the Goddess and her bodyguard  

355
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:25,040
suddenly saw a mountain covered in magic 
fog and lit by golden light from Heaven.  

356
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:30,480
They recognised it at once as the 
mountain which covered the Monkey King.

357
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:34,400
Kuan-yin looked sad and recited:

358
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:38,320
Long ago he was purposelessly brave.

359
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:43,760
In his blackness of heart he 
spoiled the Heavenly Apple Banquet

360
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:46,880
And tried to take the place of the Jade Emperor.

361
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:51,840
Will he ever again be free and win back his name?

362
00:40:53,760 --> 00:41:00,080
Then came a voice from inside the mountain: 
'Who is reciting a list of my crimes?'

363
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,640
Kuan-yin found the spirit who looked after Monkey.  

364
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:12,000
This spirit led her to Monkey's prison under 
the mountain, which was a kind of stone box.

365
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:21,200
Monkey looked out through a thin opening with his 
red eyes and cried, 'You are the Goddess Kuan-yin!  

366
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:29,680
Why have you come here? Buddha tricked me and 
I have sat in this little box for five hundred  

367
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:37,280
years. But I am very sorry for the things I have 
done and now I want to do good in the world.'

368
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:43,680
Kuan-yin was very happy. 'Just wait quietly here  

369
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:49,040
until I return with my pilgrim 
and he will save you,' she said.

370
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:56,080
And so they left Monkey and went on 
to the East, to find the pilgrim.
 
 
 

371
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,240
CHAPTER TWO

372
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,720
The Journey Begins

373
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,840
'I can tell you that I have 
killed quite a lot of people.  

374
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:12,480
And I am still the great 
Monkey King!' answered Monkey.

375
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:18,240
At a time when the great and 
very old city of Ch'ang-an  

376
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:24,080
was the capital of China, there was an examination 
to find the cleverest men in the country.  

377
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,920
These men would do the work of the government.

378
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:35,360
A man by the name of Ch'en O decided 
to try his luck at the examination,  

379
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:41,760
as it was his mother's wish. Arriving late, 
he found that the examination had begun.  

380
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:49,200
But to his surprise, he won first place and 
he received a letter signed by the Emperor.

381
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:57,200
In those days, the winner of first place in 
the examination was led through the streets  

382
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:04,480
on horseback. And by chance, on that day, the 
only daughter of a minister sat in her high  

383
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:12,880
tower with a ball in her hand. Seeing the handsome 
Ch'en riding by, and knowing of his success in the  

384
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:20,960
examination, she threw the ball cleverly on to 
his hat. This was how a lady chose her husband.

385
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:28,400
No time was wasted. Ch'en and the minister's 
daughter were married, and hand in hand they  

386
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:36,160
went into the bedroom as man and wife. Early next 
morning, Ch'en was made Governor of Chiang-chou  

387
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:42,800
and, as he was told to begin work at once, 
he started on the journey with his wife.

388
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:52,240
It was late spring. There was a gentle wind in 
the trees and a light rain fell. The road to  

389
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:59,920
Chiang-chou took Ch'en and his wife close to his 
home, so they stopped at his mother's house. Ch'en  

390
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:05,920
said to his mother, 'You wanted me to take 
the examination, and look at all the good  

391
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:11,360
luck that has come from it. I would like to 
thank you and to ask you to come with us.'

392
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:19,520
His mother happily agreed and after travelling 
for some days, the three arrived at the Hotel of  

393
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:26,320
Ten Thousand Flowers. But here the mother 
suddenly became ill and asked to rest.

394
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:34,640
Next day, a man arrived with a gold-coloured fish 
for sale and young Ch'en bought it for his mother.  

395
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:43,120
Suddenly, he noticed that the fish's eyes were 
strange. 'This is not an ordinary creature,' he  

396
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:49,840
said. He asked where it was caught and then 
returned it to the river in the same place.

397
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:54,400
'You were right to put the 
fish back in the river,'  

398
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:58,960
said his mother when he told her 
about the fish's eyes. Then she said,  

399
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:05,600
'Leave me here with some of the luggage and 
I shall follow when the days are cooler.'

400
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:14,960
When Ch'en, his wife and servants arrived at the 
same river, they were met by two boatmen who Ch'en  

401
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:20,880
had harmed in an earlier life. They stared 
at his young wife, who was very beautiful.  

402
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:28,400
Then they took the boat to a lonely place 
and killed first the servants and then Ch'en  

403
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:34,320
himself. The young woman tried to throw 
herself into the river, but they stopped her.

404
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:38,480
One of the murderers, whose name was Liu,  

405
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:45,840
put on the Governor's clothes, took the official 
papers and left for Chiang-chou with Mrs Ch'en.

406
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:54,000
Liu left the boat with the other boatman, Li, 
who threw the bodies into the river. The bodies  

407
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:59,840
of the servants could be seen on the river, 
but Ch'en's body went straight to the bottom.  

408
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:07,840
A servant of the Dragon King saw it there and went 
to the palace to tell the Dragon King himself.  

409
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,720
The Dragon King asked to see it.

410
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:16,080
When Ch'en's body was brought 
to him, he recognised this man.  

411
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:24,640
In the body of a gold-coloured fish, the Dragon 
King had been saved by him only a few days before.  

412
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:31,600
In return for Ch'en's kindness, the Dragon 
King sent his servant to the place where the  

413
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:41,840
souls of the newly dead go. The servant returned 
with Ch'en's soul and Ch'en woke from the dead.

414
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:48,880
When he had heard Ch'en's story, the 
Dragon King said, 'You certainly helped me.  

415
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:56,240
So I shall now give you back your life. 
I want you to work in my Water Office.'

416
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:03,440
While this was happening, Mrs 
Ch'en was so unhappy with Liu  

417
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:08,640
that she could not eat or sleep. But because 
she was going to have her husband's child,  

418
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:13,040
she thought it was best to 
follow this terrible man quietly.  

419
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:21,440
After a long journey they reached Chiang-chou, 
where Liu the boatman became the new governor.

420
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:32,080
Time passed and Mrs Ch'en gave birth to a son. 
At the same time a mysterious voice whispered  

421
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:40,000
in her ear, 'Listen to what I am telling you. 
This child will be famous around the world.  

422
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:48,640
But you must protect him from Liu, who will 
certainly try to harm him. Your husband is safe  

423
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:56,800
with the Dragon King and one day you will all be 
together again and your enemies will be punished.'  

424
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:02,320
Then there was silence. Mrs Ch'en  

425
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:07,760
held her son in her arms, but she could 
think of no other way to protect him.

426
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:16,400
And as the voice had said, when Liu returned he 
ordered the death of the child. But the unhappy  

427
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:23,840
mother wanted more time with her son. 'I will 
put him in the river tomorrow,' she promised Liu.  

428
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:28,960
'Perhaps,' she thought, 'a 
kind god will save him.'

429
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:38,320
She bit her finger and, with her blood, wrote a 
letter giving the names of the child's parents.  

430
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:41,760
Then, so that she would know her child again,  

431
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:48,240
she bit off the top of the little toe 
of his left foot. When morning came,  

432
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:54,080
she tied the baby into one of her shirts 
and went quietly down to the river with him.

433
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:03,840
As she stood at the water's edge, a large piece 
of wood came down the river. Quickly, she tied the  

434
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:10,880
shirt with the baby in it to the wood and put 
the letter she had written in the shirt. Then  

435
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:17,760
she pushed the wood to the centre of the river 
and walked back, crying every step of the way.

436
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:25,680
The piece of wood with the baby on it was carried 
at last to the Temple of the Golden Mountain.  

437
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:30,720
The Holy Master, hearing 
the sound of a baby crying,  

438
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:38,240
went to the river and found the strange boat. 
He read the letter about the child's father, and  

439
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:45,760
immediately gave the child the name of River Wood. 
Then he asked some farmers to look after him.

440
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:54,000
Seventeen years later, the young man had been 
given the new name of Hsuan Tsang and had been  

441
00:49:54,000 --> 00:50:01,920
made a priest in the Holy Master's temple. One 
day an old and stupid priest cried out, 'Who do  

442
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:09,040
you think you are? No one even knows your real 
name!' He was jealous of the young man's wisdom.

443
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:18,000
The unhappy boy ran to the Holy Master. 'Can there 
be,' he asked, 'a man without a father or mother?'

444
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:26,560
From a hiding-place in his room, the Holy Master 
took down a small box containing the blood-letter  

445
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:34,320
and the shirt. Soon Hsuan Tsang knew the whole 
story and the terrible wrong done to his parents.  

446
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:37,840
He wanted to kill his father's murderer.

447
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:46,960
'If you must go,' said the Holy Master, 'take 
these things with you. Travel as a poor priest,  

448
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,880
go to Chiang-chou and demand to see your mother.'

449
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:59,040
That same night, his mother dreamed of a moon 
behind the clouds. When the clouds moved,  

450
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:05,840
she saw a full moon, and then she thought 
of her son. 'He must be seventeen by now.  

451
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:08,960
Perhaps Heaven will bring us together again.'

452
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:15,200
Suddenly, she heard a priest asking 
for money at the gate and went out to  

453
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:22,880
him. When she heard his place of birth, the 
Golden Mountain, she looked at him closely  

454
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:28,880
and said, 'Little priest, you are very 
like my husband. Who were your parents?'

455
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:37,520
'A wrong was done to my parents,' was the answer. 
'My Holy Master told me to come here and find my  

456
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:45,440
mother. My father's name is Ch'en, but my holy 
name is Hsuan Tsang.' Then he took from the box  

457
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:52,080
the blood-letter and the shirt. She recognised 
them at once and she put her arms around him.

458
00:51:53,040 --> 00:52:00,400
'Leave me, leave me!' she cried. 'If Liu finds 
you, he will kill you. Go now, as fast as  

459
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:06,960
lightning! But tomorrow I will say that I have 
promised a hundred pairs of shoes to the poor  

460
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:12,560
and I must journey to the temple to offer 
this present to the Gods. There we can talk.'

461
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:21,200
True to her promise, within five days a 
hundred pairs of shoes were put on a boat  

462
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:25,120
and, with some servants, she made 
the journey to the Golden Mountain.  

463
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:32,720
All the priests came out to welcome the visitor, 
but when she had prayed she asked them to leave.

464
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:40,560
Then, on her knees in front of Hsuan Tsang, she 
took off the shoe and sock from his left foot.  

465
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:45,840
As she expected, the top of 
his left toe was missing.

466
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:50,560
Again the mother and son put 
their arms around each other,  

467
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:57,680
and she thanked the Holy Master for his great 
kindness. Then she gave Hsuan Tsang a ring to  

468
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:03,280
take to the Hotel of Ten Thousand Flowers, 
where his grandmother had been left behind.

469
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:08,640
'Here, also, is a letter to 
my father in the capital,'  

470
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:15,440
she said. 'Tell him to ask the Emperor to 
send horses and men to kill Liu and save me.  

471
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:20,480
Now I dare not stay any 
longer, but must return home.'

472
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:29,280
Hsuan Tsang went to the Hotel of Ten Thousand 
Flowers and asked about his grandmother. The  

473
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:36,000
owner of the hotel told him, 'The lady was 
here for several years. But she went blind  

474
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:41,840
and now, asking people in the streets 
for money, she lives in a box.'

475
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:47,200
Hsuan Tsang finally found his 
poor grandmother, who cried,  

476
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:55,840
'Oh! I thought my son had forgotten me! And 
now Heaven has sent a grandson to find me.'

477
00:53:56,480 --> 00:54:01,120
After paying her bills and leaving her 
in a comfortable room at the hotel,  

478
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:07,840
Hsuan Tsang rushed back to the capital 
and to the house of Minister Yin. But  

479
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:13,280
they refused to let him in. 'No one in 
our family is a priest,' he was told.

480
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:21,440
'Last night I dreamed about my daughter,' said 
the wife. 'Perhaps he has a message from her.'

481
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:27,120
Hsuan Tsang bowed to them and took out 
the letter that his mother had written.  

482
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:36,400
The minister cried, 'Wife! This is our grandchild. 
Ch'en has been killed and our daughter has been  

483
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:41,920
forced to live with the murderer. I will ask 
the Emperor for soldiers to kill that man.'

484
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:50,160
The Emperor was wild with anger and sent an 
army of sixty thousand men to Chiang-chou.  

485
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:55,200
They easily found Liu and took 
him away to cut his head off.

486
00:54:56,480 --> 00:55:03,760
Now Yin sent for his daughter. She did not wish 
to see her father because she was ashamed. Had she  

487
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:10,080
not lived as the wife of her husband's murderer? 
But Yin told her that it was not her fault.  

488
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:20,240
He put his arms around her and around his grandson 
and kept them in his arms for a long, long time.

489
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:28,400
By now, the soldiers had found the other boatman, 
Li, and had cut his head off too. And where he had  

490
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:35,280
killed Ch'en, Li's body was cut open. His heart 
was offered to the soul of the man he had killed.

491
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:43,920
The Dragon King heard of this and he sent 
a message to Ch'en. 'Congratulations!  

492
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:49,200
Your wife and her father and 
your child are all by the river,  

493
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:57,200
offering the heart of the man who killed you. I 
will now return your soul to you and let you go.'

494
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:04,000
Mrs Ch'en wanted to throw herself into 
the river where her husband had died,  

495
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:08,560
but suddenly a body came up 
from the bottom of the river.  

496
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:16,240
Mrs Ch'en recognised it as her 
husband's body and cried and screamed.

497
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:24,800
The hands moved, and then the legs, and then the 
whole body, until Ch'en himself climbed out of the  

498
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:31,440
water. He looked at them in great surprise 
and said, 'What are you all doing here?'

499
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:40,160
A great banquet was ordered and next day they 
all left for home. On the way, they called  

500
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:46,560
at the Hotel of Ten Thousand Flowers for the 
grandmother and took her back to the capital.

501
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:55,760
At last Chen became a government advisor. 
His son, Hsuan Tsang, went back to his work  

502
00:56:55,760 --> 00:57:01,440
as a priest at the Temple of the Golden 
Mountain. But when the Emperor died,  

503
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:09,400
priests all over China were asked to choose 
the holiest priest, and they chose Hsuan Tsang.

504
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:17,520
At this time, the search was still continuing for 
a priest holy enough to fetch the Scriptures from  

505
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:24,800
India. The Goddess Kuan-yin, realising 
that the holiest priest was River Wood,  

506
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:28,880
said to herself, 'No one could 
be a better man than him.'

507
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:31,600
In the great city of Ch'ang-an,  

508
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:37,760
the new Emperor asked Hsuan Tsang to 
go to India and fetch the Scriptures.  

509
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:46,400
When Hsuan Tsang agreed to go, the Emperor said, 
'If you dare to go on a journey as long as this,  

510
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:55,680
with all its dangers, I will make you here and now 
the brother of my soul.' Then he bowed four times.

511
00:57:57,040 --> 00:58:01,520
'If I do not reach India and do not 
bring the Scriptures back to China,  

512
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:05,600
I must be sent to Hell,' the young priest replied.

513
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:12,240
The Emperor called for wine and 
said, 'I suggest that you take the  

514
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:21,840
name of the Scriptures in India 
- Tripitaka. What do you think?'

515
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:30,160
Hsuan Tsang accepted the name and 
from that day he was called Tripitaka.

516
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:38,400
It was three days before the full moon when 
Tripitaka left the gates of Ch'ang-an. After  

517
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:46,320
a day or two of hard riding, he reached the Temple 
of the Low Cloud. There the Holy Master and almost  

518
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:52,320
five hundred priests discussed his journey 
and its terrible dangers and difficulties.  

519
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:56,080
Tripitaka pointed in silence to his heart.

520
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:03,920
'It is only the heart that can win against 
difficulties. I have made my promise and I  

521
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:10,240
cannot go back until I have reached India, 
seen Buddha and got the Scriptures.'

522
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:18,400
Next morning, Tripitaka got up early. A bright 
moon was shining on the snow on the ground  

523
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:26,880
as he left. Almost immediately, he lost his way, 
and suddenly the ground moved under his horse.  

524
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:31,840
The horse and rider fell into a deep hole.

525
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:34,880
'Take him! Take him!'

526
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:43,440
Looking up, Tripitaka saw a crowd of ugly 
creatures looking down at him. They pulled him  

527
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:50,080
out of the hole. Their leader was an ugly 
Demon King, who gave orders to eat him.

528
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:58,960
But two dark ugly creatures arrived as guests, and 
two other men were brought out as a meal for them.  

529
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:06,240
The ugly creatures ate like wild animals, 
their teeth pulling at the men until they  

530
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:13,840
had completely eaten them. Watching this, 
Tripitaka was almost dead with fear.

531
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:17,600
But then all the ugly creatures went to sleep.  

532
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:24,240
Tripitaka was losing all hope of escape 
when suddenly an old man appeared.  

533
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:32,320
He blew in Tripitaka's face and asked him 
if the horse belonged to him. Tripitaka  

534
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:38,800
saw to his surprise that his horse was 
not harmed. He asked what this place was  

535
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:46,480
and who the ugly creatures were. He was told it 
was a mountain full of demons and animal-spirits.

536
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:53,760
'They did not eat you because your 
soul was too good,' said the old man.

537
01:00:54,480 --> 01:01:02,400
'It was your soul that saved you. Follow me 
and I will show you the way out of here.'

538
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:12,080
The old man led him out of that place; then, 
as Tripitaka turned to thank him, the old man  

539
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:20,400
flew up into the sky on a great white bird. A 
piece of paper blew down, and on it was written,  

540
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:30,560
'I was sent by the Gods to protect you on your 
journey. Remember, the Gods will be watching you.'

541
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:37,840
Tripitaka could only bow low in thanks 
before he began his journey again.  

542
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:45,360
After half a day he found himself 
in difficult mountain country,  

543
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:54,000
moving forward slowly over sharp rocks. In front 
of him, two tigers waited. Realising the danger,  

544
01:01:54,000 --> 01:02:02,400
he looked behind him and there he saw an insect 
that could kill him. On his right stood a wild  

545
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:08,400
animal that he had never seen before. His 
frightened horse went down on its knees.

546
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:13,200
As the terrible creatures all 
started attacking him at once,  

547
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:18,480
a man appeared with a sword. He 
took Tripitaka from his horse.

548
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:25,040
'I am a hunter who these animals know 
and fear. You and I are from the same  

549
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:29,840
country and you and your horse can 
rest at my house until tomorrow.'

550
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:37,280
On the way to his house the hunter 
killed a tiger, saying, 'This is luck!  

551
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:39,520
Enough meat to last you for days!'

552
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:47,200
Arriving at a mountain farm, Tripitaka 
was presented to the hunter's mother,  

553
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:52,880
who invited him to stay overnight. But when 
the cooked tiger was put in front of him  

554
01:02:53,440 --> 01:03:02,080
he had to say that, as a priest, he did not 
eat meat. He was given rice and salad instead.  

555
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:06,080
Then, putting his hands 
together, he said a prayer.

556
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:13,120
The hunter was surprised. 'You priests 
are certainly strange,' he said.  

557
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:15,840
'You cannot even eat without a prayer.'

558
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:23,680
After dinner the hunter led his guest 
to a little house full of animal skins.  

559
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:28,800
Tripitaka did not like that very much, so his host  

560
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:36,960
took him instead to a field of red and gold 
flowers. There, animals ran to him when he called.

561
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:43,840
Tripitaka had been asked by the hunter's 
mother to say prayers for her dead husband.  

562
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:51,440
So scriptures were read and prayers were 
said all through the next day until evening.

563
01:03:53,600 --> 01:04:00,800
That night everyone in the family dreamed the 
same dream: the hunter's father had been allowed  

564
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:09,520
to leave the Lower World and was born again as the 
child of a rich landowner. This, they were sure,  

565
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:16,720
was a result of Tripitaka's prayers and they all 
thanked him. They wanted to give him presents of  

566
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:23,680
silver, but he refused the presents and left 
on his journey, with the hunter as his guide.

567
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:30,320
At the Mountain Between Two 
Countries, which was steep and rocky,  

568
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:34,880
the hunter climbed quickly 
but Tripitaka was very tired.

569
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:43,600
'This country to the East,' said the hunter, 
'is our land of Tang, and to the West is the  

570
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:49,920
country of the Tartars. I cannot go into 
their country, so you must continue alone.'

571
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:56,320
Feeling a great fear and hopelessness, 
Tripitaka held the hunter's arm.  

572
01:04:58,560 --> 01:05:06,320
Suddenly, from under the mountain, a voice 
cried, again and again, 'The Master has come.'

573
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:10,720
'Who is that?' Tripitaka asked, fearfully.

574
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:19,440
'It is the voice of the old monkey calling from 
his stone box under the mountain. The story is  

575
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:26,400
that long ago, when the mountain was called the 
Mountain of Metal, Wood, Water, Fire and Earth,  

576
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:31,680
a magic monkey was put in 
a stone box by angry gods.  

577
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:38,880
He is certainly still alive. You need not 
be afraid. We will go down and have a look.'

578
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:45,520
As the hunter had said, there was 
a stone box with a hole in it,  

579
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:48,560
and through the opening they 
could see the head of a monkey.

580
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:56,320
'Master! Master! Free me from here and I will 
protect you on your journey to the West!'

581
01:05:57,520 --> 01:06:01,440
The hunter said, 'First, we 
want to know more about you.'

582
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:08,800
'I will not tell you anything,' said 
Monkey. 'I wish to speak to the priest.'

583
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:13,520
'What do you want to say to me?' asked Tripitaka.

584
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:19,840
'Were you sent by the Emperor of T'ang 
to fetch the Scriptures from India?'

585
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:21,440
'I was.'

586
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:30,560
'I am the Monkey King and five hundred years ago I 
made trouble, so Buddha put me in this stone box.  

587
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:37,840
The Goddess Kuan-yin has visited me. She 
said that if I protect the pilgrim on his  

588
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:44,240
way to India I will be forgiven and 
freed. So let me be your follower.'

589
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:48,000
'But how can I get you out of this stone box?'

590
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:52,560
'If you make a wish, Master, I will be out,'  

591
01:06:53,200 --> 01:07:00,800
said Monkey. 'Go to the top of the mountain and 
there you will see a rock with letters of gold  

592
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:05,920
written by Buddha himself. Lift 
the rock and I will be free.'

593
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:11,680
'How can we believe him?' the 
hunter whispered to Tripitaka.

594
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:17,840
'It is true! It is true!' screamed 
Monkey, from inside his box.

595
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:23,680
Tripitaka and the hunter climbed up 
again to the top of the mountain,  

596
01:07:24,320 --> 01:07:30,480
and there they saw golden light pouring 
from a rock which had gold writing on it.

597
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:37,360
Tripitaka went down on his knees and 
said, 'If this is the wish of the Gods,  

598
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:43,760
I will take this Monkey with me to 
India. Take away this rock and free him.'

599
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:52,880
A warm and sweet-smelling wind blew across the 
mountain and lifted the rock and Buddha's writing  

600
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:58,560
up into the air. Tripitaka and 
the hunter returned to Monkey.

601
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:06,480
'You can come out,' they said. With 
a great noise of breaking stone,  

602
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:11,280
Monkey came out of the stone box 
and bowed in front of Tripitaka.  

603
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:20,320
He cried, 'Master, I am out,' and then he began 
to prepare Tripitaka's horse for the journey.

604
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:28,960
Tripitaka thanked the hunter for his kindness 
and he and Monkey continued their journey.

605
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:37,280
When Tripitaka and Monkey left the mountain, 
a tiger appeared in front of them, showing its  

606
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:44,880
teeth. Monkey seemed very happy. 'He 
has come to give me his coat,' he said.

607
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:52,080
He took a needle from behind his ear and the 
needle was immediately transformed into a cudgel.  

608
01:08:53,280 --> 01:08:58,080
'It is five hundred years since I 
last used this weapon,' he cried.

609
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:08,720
Look at Monkey! He walks forward bravely, down 
comes the cudgel, and the tiger falls dead.

610
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:16,240
'Sit down,' said Monkey to 
Tripitaka, 'while I take his coat.'

611
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:25,920
Dear Monkey! He took a single hair from his own 
tail, blew on it, and said some magic words.  

612
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:33,840
The hair became a sharp little knife, and 
with this knife he cut off the tiger's skin.  

613
01:09:34,720 --> 01:09:39,280
'Now we can leave this place,' he 
said. 'When we reach the next house,  

614
01:09:39,280 --> 01:09:41,600
I will make a fine coat from the skin.'

615
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:50,160
Monkey then explained the magic of his cudgel, 
which was not only for killing tigers and dragons,  

616
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:56,000
but also for making rivers go backwards 
or starting storms on the sea.  

617
01:09:57,440 --> 01:10:01,840
But then he saw a house in some trees, 
where they could spend the night.

618
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:06,720
He got down from his horse 
and cried, 'Open the door!'

619
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:16,240
A very old man, angry at the rude command, began 
to push open the door. But seeing Monkey carrying  

620
01:10:16,240 --> 01:10:23,280
a tiger skin and looking like a demon, he became 
very frightened. Then he saw that Monkey was  

621
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:32,320
with a priest and he was told that Monkey was the 
priest's follower. Suddenly, he recognised Monkey.

622
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:40,880
'You are the Stone Monkey in the stone 
box,' said the old man in great surprise.  

623
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:43,840
'How did you get out?'

624
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:49,440
Monkey told his story and then was asked his age.

625
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:54,080
'First, how old are you?' asked Monkey.

626
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:58,800
'One hundred and thirty.'

627
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:02,480
'You are young enough to be 
my great-great-grandson,'  

628
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:08,480
said Monkey. 'I was under that 
mountain for five hundred years.'

629
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:14,080
'True,' said the old man. 'And when I was a boy,  

630
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:18,880
there was grass on your 
head and dirt on your face.'

631
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:25,280
'Yes!' said Monkey. 'I do not 
wish to make trouble, but it  

632
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:31,040
is five hundred years since I last washed. 
Could you let us have a little hot water?'

633
01:11:32,720 --> 01:11:36,560
When they had both washed, 
Monkey took Tripitaka's white  

634
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:43,120
shirt, made himself a tiger-skin coat and 
asked, 'How do I look in these clothes?'

635
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:54,000
'Fine!' said Tripitaka. 'You really look like 
a pilgrim!' And he let Monkey keep the shirt.

636
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:58,880
Many days later, the two travellers 
were attacked by six men with swords.

637
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:03,120
The men demanded their horses and 
everything they had with them.

638
01:12:04,240 --> 01:12:08,160
'You are just thieves!' cried Monkey.  

639
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:13,600
'If you give me one seventh of everything 
you have ever stolen, I will let you live.'

640
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:18,400
Angrily, they all hit Monkey 
on the head, again and again.

641
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:24,880
Monkey said, 'Let me know when you are 
tired and I will take out my needle.'

642
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:31,200
Of course the needle from behind Monkey's 
ear transformed itself into a cudgel,  

643
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:36,160
and soon he had killed all six of them.  

644
01:12:36,160 --> 01:12:41,360
He returned, crying, 'Master, we can 
start now. I have killed them all.'

645
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:47,440
'You should never kill,' said Tripitaka, sadly.

646
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:49,840
'But I had to! They were going to kill you!'

647
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:56,160
'It is better for a priest 
to die than to kill others.'

648
01:12:57,200 --> 01:13:02,000
'Well, I can tell you that I have 
killed quite a lot of people. And I  

649
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:06,000
am still the great Monkey King!' answered Monkey.

650
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:13,600
'Your bad behaviour in Heaven caused you to 
live in a stone box for five hundred years,'  

651
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:21,040
said Tripitaka. 'If you hope to come with me 
to India, you will need to change your ways.'

652
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:26,480
Monkey was very angry that Tripitaka 
had spoken to him like that.  

653
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:32,240
'Master,' he shouted, 'I am leaving.'

654
01:13:32,240 --> 01:13:39,200
Tripitaka said nothing, so Monkey leapt up, 
ran away and was soon out of Tripitaka's sight.

655
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:47,680
Tripitaka thought, 'It is no use trying 
to teach people who are like that.' So,  

656
01:13:47,680 --> 01:13:52,160
putting all the luggage on the horse's 
back, he left alone and on foot.

657
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:58,000
The young priest had not gone far when 
he met an old woman carrying a cap.  

658
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:02,880
She asked him why he was travelling 
alone without a follower to help him.

659
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:10,160
'I had a follower, but he behaved badly. 
When I told him that, he ran away.'

660
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:18,480
'That is unfortunate,' she said. 'This 
cap belonged to my son, who died.  

661
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:22,720
I can gladly give it to your 
follower if he would like it.'

662
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:26,560
'He ran away to the East,' said Tripitaka.

663
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:31,680
'Then he will certainly go to my 
house and I shall send him back.  

664
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:40,560
If you want him to return, you will need a spell.' 
She told him the words. 'You must make him wear  

665
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:48,560
this cap. When he disobeys, say the words of 
the spell and he will give you no more trouble.'

666
01:14:50,160 --> 01:14:56,400
The old woman transformed herself into a 
golden light and disappeared towards the East.  

667
01:14:57,920 --> 01:15:02,560
Tripitaka knew then that she 
was really the Goddess Kuan-yin.

668
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:10,160
Monkey had jumped on to a cloud and was returning 
to his cave in the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit.  

669
01:15:10,160 --> 01:15:13,760
On the way, he decided to 
drink tea with the Dragon King.  

670
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:20,640
When Monkey had told his story, the Dragon 
King told him about the value of patience.

671
01:15:21,680 --> 01:15:28,800
'Monkey King, it is necessary to control yourself 
if you do not want to spoil all your chances.'

672
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:33,280
Monkey thought about that and then jumped up.  

673
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:38,960
'Don't say another word!' he said. 
'I will return to my Master at once.'

674
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:46,480
'Master,' said Monkey, when he found Tripitaka 
sitting sadly by the side of the road,  

675
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:49,520
'what are you doing, still sitting here?'

676
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:54,960
'Waiting for you,' he answered. 
'I could not continue alone.'

677
01:15:56,160 --> 01:16:00,080
'I only went to drink tea with 
the Dragon King,' said Monkey.

678
01:16:01,680 --> 01:16:06,240
'If that is true, you should think 
about my thirst and my hunger too.'

679
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:12,000
Monkey went to their luggage to look 
for food and found the gift of the cap.

680
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:16,640
'If a person wears that cap,' said Tripitaka,  

681
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:21,040
'they can recite the Scriptures 
without learning them first.'

682
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:24,080
'Let me put it on!' cried Monkey.

683
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:26,000
'Yes, put it on.'

684
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:32,080
As Monkey put it on, Tripitaka 
pretended to eat some dried fruit,  

685
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:35,600
but he was really reciting the magic spell.

686
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:41,280
'My head is hurting!' screamed Monkey.

687
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:43,920
Monkey fell on the ground,  

688
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:51,280
trying to take the cap off, but a metal ring 
inside the cap was getting tighter and tighter.  

689
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:59,040
Tripitaka stopped reciting the spell because he 
was afraid that Monkey would break the metal ring.

690
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:05,440
The pain in Monkey's head disappeared, 
but the cap was still tightly there.

691
01:17:06,480 --> 01:17:10,000
'You have put a spell on me,' cried Monkey.

692
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:18,720
'Yes,' said Tripitaka. 'It is called the Scripture 
of the Tight Cap. Will you make trouble again?'

693
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:22,960
'Never! I promise,' answered Monkey,  

694
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:29,840
but in his heart he was very angry. 
He ran at Tripitaka with his cudgel.

695
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:34,160
Quickly, the priest again 
recited the words of the spell,  

696
01:17:34,160 --> 01:17:38,880
and Monkey fell to the ground screaming. 
The cudgel dropped from his hand.

697
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:43,120
'Were you going to hit me?' Tripitaka asked.

698
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:47,680
'Hit you? I dare not!' cried Monkey.

699
01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:54,880
Tripitaka stopped reciting because he did not 
like to see Monkey suffering such terrible pain.

700
01:17:56,720 --> 01:18:01,040
'Who taught you this trick?' 
Monkey asked when the pain stopped.

701
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:04,400
'An old woman who I met recently.'

702
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:11,840
'Then it was the Goddess Kuan-yin. I will go to 
the Southern Ocean and hit her with my cudgel!'

703
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:18,640
'As she taught me this spell, she can 
surely use it herself,' said Tripitaka.

704
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:26,640
Monkey sat up, holding his head, which 
still hurt him. 'I am very sorry,' he said.  

705
01:18:27,200 --> 01:18:33,280
'I will travel to India and never leave 
you. I will protect you until the end.'

706
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:36,480
Unable to defend himself,  

707
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:42,080
Monkey put the luggage together, and they started 
off again towards the West.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

708
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:46,000
CHAPTER THREE

709
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:49,440
Tripitaka Finds New Followers

710
01:18:51,680 --> 01:18:54,880
With her magic breath she shouted 'Change!'  

711
01:18:55,520 --> 01:18:59,680
She transformed the Dragon into 
the horse that he had just eaten.

712
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:06,560
It was the middle of winter and a 
cold wind was blowing from the North.

713
01:19:07,120 --> 01:19:13,840
There was ice everywhere and deep snow was 
lying on the ground. But the brave priest,  

714
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:19,360
his follower and the white horse continued 
their journey across the mountains.

715
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:26,160
They were looking down at a river when 
suddenly a dragon appeared in it and  

716
01:19:26,160 --> 01:19:33,600
then climbed slowly out of the water. While 
Monkey and Tripitaka ran and hid, the Dragon,  

717
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:39,680
moving along at speed and without stopping, 
opened its mouth and ate the horse.

718
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:46,080
Monkey left Tripitaka sitting on a rock 
and went back to get the horse and luggage,  

719
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:53,200
but he could not find the horse. He took the 
luggage to the place where he had left Tripitaka.

720
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:56,800
'The Dragon is gone,' said Monkey,  

721
01:19:56,800 --> 01:20:01,360
'and the horse is too. It probably 
ran away because it was frightened.'

722
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:05,440
'How are we going to find it?' asked Tripitaka.

723
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:09,600
'Wait here and I will have a look,' said Monkey.

724
01:20:10,640 --> 01:20:15,600
Monkey leapt into the sky and looked 
for it with his bright red eyes.

725
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:22,720
'I cannot see it anywhere,' he told 
Tripitaka. 'I think the Dragon ate it.'

726
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:29,200
'How can I travel if it has been 
eaten? It is much too far to walk,'  

727
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:35,280
cried Tripitaka. Poor Tripitaka was 
so sad that he could not stop crying.

728
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:41,040
Monkey, who hated that kind of 
attitude, shouted at Tripitaka,  

729
01:20:41,680 --> 01:20:47,760
'You look like a fool, sitting there crying! 
Wait there while I go after the Dragon.'

730
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:53,360
'You cannot do anything to the 
Dragon if he is in the water,'  

731
01:20:53,360 --> 01:20:58,320
said the young priest, still crying. 
'And next time he will eat me!

732
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:04,800
'You are hopeless! Hopeless!' 
shouted Monkey, angrier than ever.  

733
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:09,200
'Do you want to sit there 
staring at the luggage forever?'

734
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:17,280
He was still shouting angrily when the voices 
of Gods were heard in the sky. 'Monkey,  

735
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:26,160
don't be angry. Priest, don't cry. We 
are here to protect you,' they said.

736
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:32,480
'Then you had better stay here and 
look after the Master,' said Monkey.  

737
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:36,000
'I am going to find that 
horse! Don't worry about me!'

738
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:41,840
Tripitaka, feeling better, 
asked Monkey to be careful.

739
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:47,120
Dear Monkey! He pulled his 
tiger-skin coat around his body,  

740
01:21:47,680 --> 01:21:50,800
picked up his cudgel and walked down to the river.

741
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:58,320
'You demon fish, return my horse 
to me,' he called into the water.

742
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:06,880
The Dragon leapt out of the river. 'Who is 
making all that noise?' it shouted, angrily.

743
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:14,480
'Come and fight,' shouted Monkey, as he waved 
his cudgel. 'And give me back my horse!'

744
01:22:16,160 --> 01:22:22,560
Monkey hit the Dragon's head with his cudgel. The 
Dragon came forwards with his mouth wide open.  

745
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:30,800
It was a long and brave fight. They fought 
backwards and forwards, round and round, and  

746
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:37,760
up and down until the Dragon began to feel 
weak. With a quick turn of his long tail,  

747
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:43,440
he disappeared back into the river. Monkey 
shouted for him to come back and fight,  

748
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:50,000
but the Dragon did not listen. Monkey 
decided to go back and tell Tripitaka.

749
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:56,480
When Monkey returned, Tripitaka said 
something that Monkey did not like.  

750
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:04,240
'The other day, after you fought the tiger, 
you said you could also kill dragons.  

751
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:09,280
I do not understand why you are having 
such difficulties with this dragon.'

752
01:23:10,240 --> 01:23:15,520
'Not another word!' he cried. 'I 
will soon show you who is master!'

753
01:23:16,480 --> 01:23:22,960
Annoyed, Monkey went back to the river 
and used his magic to make a storm. The  

754
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:29,840
Dragon leapt up and shouted, 'What sort of 
creature are you? Where do you come from?'

755
01:23:31,120 --> 01:23:35,040
'That is not your business 
- just return my horse!'

756
01:23:35,680 --> 01:23:42,480
'How can I? Your horse is inside me. And 
if I do not, what will you do to me?'

757
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:48,000
'Look at this cudgel,' said 
Monkey. 'If you do not give  

758
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:51,920
me back the horse, you will 
pay for it with your life.'

759
01:23:53,200 --> 01:23:57,760
Again they fought, and then 
the Dragon transformed himself  

760
01:23:58,320 --> 01:24:05,280
into an insect and disappeared into the long 
grass. Beating the grass with his cudgel,  

761
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:10,640
Monkey danced around wildly, trying 
to find him. But it was impossible.  

762
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:16,320
So Monkey returned to Tripitaka, who 
was feeling quite sorry for himself.

763
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:23,280
'I will be dead from cold or hunger before 
we get across this river,' said Tripitaka.

764
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:27,680
Monkey danced and jumped and leapt in anger,  

765
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:36,560
but finally he had to ask the Goddess Kuan-yin 
for help. When he saw her, he became angry again.

766
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:43,840
'You told me to look after this priest,' shouted 
Monkey. 'So why did you give him a cap that I  

767
01:24:43,840 --> 01:24:49,920
cannot take off my head? It gives me terrible 
pains when he says the words of the spell!'

768
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:58,160
The Goddess laughed. 'Because you are so full of 
tricks, there is no other way to control you.'

769
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:02,480
'But what about this dragon? 
That is your work too.  

770
01:25:03,280 --> 01:25:08,800
Why did you let him eat my Master's 
horse? You should be ashamed of yourself!'

771
01:25:09,920 --> 01:25:12,800
'That dragon,' said the Goddess Kuan-yin,  

772
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:20,720
'behaved badly in Heaven. If he carries the priest 
of the Emperor T'ang on his journey to India,  

773
01:25:20,720 --> 01:25:27,360
he will be forgiven and he knows this. No 
ordinary Chinese horse could possibly do it.  

774
01:25:28,240 --> 01:25:33,840
I cannot understand why he ate the 
horse. I will go with you and find out.'

775
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:42,160
She got down from her seat inside her cave 
and rode on a magic light to find the Dragon.  

776
01:25:43,200 --> 01:25:47,040
When the Dragon saw Kuan-yin, 
he changed into a human.

777
01:25:48,320 --> 01:25:52,800
'Did you know that this is 
Tripitaka's follower?' asked Kuan-yin.

778
01:25:53,680 --> 01:25:59,680
'How could I? I asked him what kind of 
creature he was and he shouted at me,  

779
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:04,560
"That is not your business." I ate 
his horse because I was hungry.  

780
01:26:05,120 --> 01:26:11,040
He never said anything about looking for 
Scriptures. He never once used the word "T'ang".'

781
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:19,360
'Monkey is fonder of showing others his own 
powers than explaining anything,' said Kuan-yin.  

782
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:26,400
'But in future, if anyone questions him, he 
must say that he is looking for Scriptures.  

783
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:28,880
Then there will be no more trouble.'

784
01:26:30,240 --> 01:26:37,920
The Goddess went to the Dragon and put some drops 
of sweet water on him. Then with her magic breath  

785
01:26:37,920 --> 01:26:44,880
she shouted 'Change!' She transformed the 
Dragon into the horse that he had just eaten.  

786
01:26:45,680 --> 01:26:51,760
She told the Dragon to change his bad behaviour 
and to promise never to go back to his old ways.

787
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:56,000
'If you keep this promise, you will be given a  

788
01:26:56,000 --> 01:27:00,640
golden body,' she told him, 
'and you will be given wisdom.'

789
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:06,160
The Dragon said, 'Thank you. 
I will keep this promise.'

790
01:27:07,280 --> 01:27:15,360
Then the Goddess turned to go, but Monkey held her 
arm saying, 'That is not good enough! How can I  

791
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:22,000
help a priest to travel over these mountains with 
only a horse? I cannot continue this journey.'

792
01:27:23,680 --> 01:27:29,760
'That is strange,' said the Goddess. 'You 
always used to be brave, if nothing else.  

793
01:27:30,720 --> 01:27:33,520
But there is one more power I can give you.'

794
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:38,560
She took three leaves from a tree 
and dropped them on Monkey's back,  

795
01:27:39,200 --> 01:27:42,240
where they immediately became magic hairs.

796
01:27:43,200 --> 01:27:47,520
'These,' she said, 'will 
get you out of any trouble.'

797
01:27:49,040 --> 01:27:53,600
Monkey thanked her. Then he took 
the horse and led him to Tripitaka.

798
01:27:55,200 --> 01:27:58,160
'This horse is in much better 
condition than the old one.  

799
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:01,920
How did you manage to find it?' asked Tripitaka.

800
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:08,160
Monkey answered, 'Kuan-yin changed the 
Dragon into the horse that he had eaten.'

801
01:28:09,520 --> 01:28:15,440
Tripitaka wanted to say 'thank you' to Kuan-yin, 
but Monkey said that she was already far away.  

802
01:28:16,480 --> 01:28:22,960
So Tripitaka bowed towards the South. Then 
he helped Monkey to prepare their luggage.

803
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:27,840
'We still need a boat to cross 
this river,' said the priest.

804
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:33,600
'Just sit on the horse and he will 
carry you across,' Monkey replied.

805
01:28:34,320 --> 01:28:40,320
But then an old fisherman in a strange 
boat appeared. Monkey waved to him.  

806
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:44,000
'We have come from the East to fetch scriptures.  

807
01:28:44,640 --> 01:28:49,680
My Master does not know how to get 
across the river. Could you take him?

808
01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:55,840
The old fisherman took them all across 
the river, without asking for payment.

809
01:28:56,960 --> 01:29:00,160
'Do you know who that fisherman was?' said Monkey.  

810
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:06,400
'He is the God of the River and he did not 
help us in our fight against the Dragon.  

811
01:29:07,040 --> 01:29:11,680
He knew he had done wrong. That 
is why he did not take any money.'

812
01:29:13,280 --> 01:29:16,720
Tripitaka did not know how true that story was.  

813
01:29:17,440 --> 01:29:21,520
But he sat on the horse and followed 
Monkey along the road to the West.

814
01:29:22,960 --> 01:29:26,640
One evening they saw a group 
of houses in the far distance.

815
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:34,400
'Let me go and see if it is a farm and if 
it seems lucky or unlucky,' said Monkey.

816
01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:41,680
A young man in a blue jacket came out of the farm 
and tried to walk past Monkey without a word.  

817
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:46,880
But Monkey held his arm tightly 
while the young man tried to escape.

818
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:51,760
'Now, you must not be angry,' laughed Monkey,  

819
01:29:51,760 --> 01:29:56,240
holding him even tighter. 'We only 
want to know the name of this place.'

820
01:29:57,440 --> 01:30:04,640
The young man, seeing that he could not get away 
from Monkey, answered, 'The place is called Kao  

821
01:30:04,640 --> 01:30:11,760
Farm and I am Kao Ts'ai. Old Mr Kao has 
a daughter of twenty who is unmarried.  

822
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:20,000
Three years ago, a creature took her and has 
lived with her here as his wife. Six months ago  

823
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:25,360
the creature locked her in his little house, 
and none of the family has seen her since then.  

824
01:30:26,400 --> 01:30:30,560
I am going to find someone with strong 
enough magic to fight this creature.'

825
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:37,600
'This is your lucky day,' said Monkey. 
'Here I am, and I can help you.  

826
01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:41,200
Come, lead us to the master of the house.'

827
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:48,560
'Your words are true, I hope,' said the young man. 
'You will get me into great trouble if you fail.'

828
01:30:49,520 --> 01:30:53,520
'I promise,' said Monkey. 'Now, take us in.'

829
01:30:55,680 --> 01:31:03,600
Seeing the young man returning, old Mr Kao 
shouted, 'You fool!' But he quickly became  

830
01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:11,040
more polite when he saw the young priest. Seeing 
Monkey, though, he said, 'It is surely bad enough  

831
01:31:11,040 --> 01:31:18,000
to have a dirty creature living with my daughter. 
Now another ugly creature has come to visit me.'

832
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:25,760
'You have lived a long time but have learned 
very little wisdom,' said Monkey. 'You should  

833
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:31,120
not judge people only by appearances. 
But I shall return your daughter to you.'

834
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:36,640
'I do not understand. I thought 
you wanted a bed for the night.'

835
01:31:36,640 --> 01:31:43,520
'Yes, we do,' said Monkey. 'But I am also 
happy to kill any dirty creatures for you,  

836
01:31:43,520 --> 01:31:44,480
for something to do.'

837
01:31:46,240 --> 01:31:52,160
'We have three daughters. Our hope was that the 
youngest would marry a farmer and work this farm.  

838
01:31:53,040 --> 01:32:00,640
Well, about three years ago, a nice-looking young 
man came here and said his name was Pig. He seemed  

839
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:06,800
the right man for our daughter and at first he 
worked hard on the farm. But then he started  

840
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:15,840
to change: his nose became longer, his ears 
became bigger, he ate more and more. Finally,  

841
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:24,080
he turned into a pig. But that was not all. 
He could bring magic winds, he could disappear  

842
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:31,920
and then appear again, he could make stones fly 
through the air. And now he keeps our daughter,  

843
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:39,840
Blue Flower, in his little house, and for six 
months we have not known if she is alive or dead.'

844
01:32:41,040 --> 01:32:46,800
'Have no fear,' said Monkey. 'I shall catch 
him tonight and return your daughter to you.'

845
01:32:47,760 --> 01:32:49,920
'But do you need weapons?'

846
01:32:49,920 --> 01:32:52,000
'I have my weapon already,'  

847
01:32:52,720 --> 01:32:58,400
said Monkey, taking his needle from behind 
his ear and changing it into an iron cudgel.  

848
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:08,160
'I need only a nice old person to sit with my 
Master and talk to him. And now I will leave you!'

849
01:33:08,160 --> 01:33:15,520
Old Mr Kao led Monkey to the little house and 
Monkey broke the door with one blow of his hand.  

850
01:33:16,640 --> 01:33:22,400
Inside it was dark as the old man 
called, 'Number three daughter!'

851
01:33:23,760 --> 01:33:25,680
'Father, I am here.'

852
01:33:27,120 --> 01:33:34,880
Monkey looked hard with his red eyes and saw 
a sad sight. The daughter's face was unwashed,  

853
01:33:34,880 --> 01:33:38,000
her hair was full of dirt and her lips were pale.  

854
01:33:39,200 --> 01:33:43,920
She walked slowly forwards and fell, 
crying, into her father's arms.

855
01:33:45,520 --> 01:33:50,800
'Don't make that noise. But where 
is the creature?' asked Monkey.

856
01:33:51,360 --> 01:33:54,320
'I do not know,' said the unhappy girl.  

857
01:33:55,040 --> 01:34:00,000
'He goes out early in the morning and 
does not come back until late at night.'

858
01:34:01,680 --> 01:34:04,960
'Take your daughter back to 
the house and stay with her,'  

859
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:10,800
said Monkey to Mr Kao. 'I shall 
wait here and end your troubles.'

860
01:34:13,520 --> 01:34:19,920
When the girl and her father had gone, Monkey 
transformed himself into a girl who looked like  

861
01:34:19,920 --> 01:34:27,520
Blue Flower. Then he waited. Soon stones 
came flying through the air and there in  

862
01:34:27,520 --> 01:34:33,360
front of him stood a terrible creature. He 
had short hairs on his dark skin, a long  

863
01:34:33,360 --> 01:34:40,640
nose and enormous ears. He wore a green jacket and 
had a spotted handkerchief tied round his head.

864
01:34:42,160 --> 01:34:48,880
Dear Monkey! He did not say hello to the 
creature. He lay on the bed making noises  

865
01:34:48,880 --> 01:34:56,240
like a person who is ill. When the creature tried 
to kiss him, he pushed it hard across the room.

866
01:34:57,520 --> 01:35:00,400
'Why are you angry with me?' asked the creature.

867
01:35:01,200 --> 01:35:03,440
'I am not angry. Get into bed.'

868
01:35:04,480 --> 01:35:09,120
The creature undressed in the dark, 
but could not find his wife in the bed.  

869
01:35:09,920 --> 01:35:14,080
Then he heard her crying on 
the far side of the room.

870
01:35:14,080 --> 01:35:17,280
'Oh, I am so unhappy!'

871
01:35:18,480 --> 01:35:21,280
'What are you complaining 
about?' asked the creature.  

872
01:35:21,920 --> 01:35:26,720
'Have I not kept my promises to 
you? I have worked on the farm,  

873
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:32,720
built walls and dug new fields. You have 
all the food and clothes that you need.'

874
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:41,440
'That is not the problem,' said Monkey in Blue 
Flower's voice. 'Today my parents came and  

875
01:35:41,440 --> 01:35:47,760
shouted through the wall that you are ugly. And 
nobody knows anything about you or who you are.'

876
01:35:49,120 --> 01:35:51,520
'There is no mystery about who I am.  

877
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:58,720
Because I look a little like a pig, I am called 
Pigsy. Next time they ask, just tell them that.'

878
01:36:00,400 --> 01:36:02,880
'They are looking for a priest to send you away,'  

879
01:36:03,440 --> 01:36:10,720
said Monkey. 'In fact, old Mr Kao has called 
the great Monkey King himself to help.'

880
01:36:11,920 --> 01:36:18,320
'If that is true, I am leaving this minute,' cried 
the creature. 'That Monkey is very powerful!'  

881
01:36:19,280 --> 01:36:23,840
And getting dressed quickly, 
he opened the door to leave.

882
01:36:24,560 --> 01:36:28,560
With a magic spell, Monkey 
transformed himself back again.

883
01:36:29,840 --> 01:36:34,320
'Look around,' he cried, 'and 
you will see that I am Monkey.'

884
01:36:35,440 --> 01:36:41,040
When Pigsy turned and saw Monkey, with 
his sharp little teeth and big smile,  

885
01:36:41,040 --> 01:36:47,920
his red eyes, flat head and hairy face, 
he ran like the wind back to his cave.

886
01:36:48,880 --> 01:36:54,400
Monkey cried after him, 'Where are you going? 
If you go up to Heaven, I will follow you.  

887
01:36:54,400 --> 01:36:59,760
And if you go down to the deepest part 
of Hell, I will follow you there too.'

888
01:37:01,360 --> 01:37:05,840
Monkey followed the creature to his 
cave and it came out waving a fork.

889
01:37:06,960 --> 01:37:13,600
They fought together all night, but at last 
the creature leapt back into the cave and  

890
01:37:13,600 --> 01:37:21,360
locked the door. Monkey now saw the name of 
the cave on a rock: it was Cloud-Ladder Cave.

891
01:37:22,960 --> 01:37:27,120
'I had better return to my Master 
now, because he might want something,'  

892
01:37:27,120 --> 01:37:31,120
Monkey thought. 'I can always 
return and catch this creature.'  

893
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:36,880
And leaping from one cloud to 
another, he was soon back at the farm.

894
01:37:38,320 --> 01:37:41,600
No one had slept all night, 
waiting for Monkey's return.  

895
01:37:42,640 --> 01:37:46,480
Tripitaka was sitting with the 
old man when Monkey arrived.

896
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:49,920
'Master, here I am,' he said.

897
01:37:51,840 --> 01:37:56,560
'Did you have to go a long way to 
catch the creature?' asked Tripitaka.

898
01:37:57,600 --> 01:38:03,200
'That is no ordinary creature. He used to 
live in Heaven, where he was in charge of  

899
01:38:03,200 --> 01:38:09,280
water-spirits. But he did wrong and he was 
sent down to Earth as a pig-like creature.  

900
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:18,000
He still has all his magic powers. I chased him to 
his mountain cave, where he fetched a large fork  

901
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:24,960
and we fought all night. As the sun came up, 
he gave up the fight and locked himself in his  

902
01:38:24,960 --> 01:38:32,240
cave. I was going to beat down the door, but I 
knew it was going to take some time. I thought  

903
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:37,760
Master might be getting anxious 
so I wanted to report back here.'

904
01:38:39,840 --> 01:38:44,720
'Monkey King,' said old Mr 
Kao, 'you have driven him away,  

905
01:38:45,280 --> 01:38:53,120
but he is certain to come back. If you can get him 
for us, you can have half of all that is ours.'

906
01:38:54,560 --> 01:38:59,120
'I think you worry too much about 
him. He knows that he eats a lot.  

907
01:38:59,840 --> 01:39:06,640
But he has also done a lot of work around 
here. He feels that his work easily pays  

908
01:39:06,640 --> 01:39:12,400
for the cost of feeding him. He is a god 
who has been sent to Earth as a punishment.  

909
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:18,160
It seems that he has done no harm 
to your daughter,' said Monkey.

910
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:24,320
'It is true,' said old Mr Kao, 
'that he has done her no harm.  

911
01:39:25,040 --> 01:39:31,120
But it is very bad for our family 
name. Everywhere I go, I hear,  

912
01:39:31,120 --> 01:39:38,400
"Mr Kao has taken a dirty creature for his 
daughter's husband." What can I say to that?'

913
01:39:39,760 --> 01:39:47,120
'Monkey,' said Tripitaka, 'do you not think that 
you should return? Have one more fight with him  

914
01:39:47,120 --> 01:39:51,120
and see if you can find a way to 
end this difficult situation.'

915
01:39:52,880 --> 01:39:58,400
'Don't worry. I was only having a little 
game with him. This time I will catch him  

916
01:39:58,400 --> 01:40:05,200
and bring him back here. Look after my Master 
until I get back!' Monkey said to Mr Kao.

917
01:40:06,800 --> 01:40:11,120
Monkey disappeared into the clouds 
and soon arrived at the cave.  

918
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:17,520
This time, Pigsy was asleep in his cave 
when Monkey broke the door in pieces.  

919
01:40:18,640 --> 01:40:22,560
Angrily, Pigsy jumped out of 
bed and took up his fork again.

920
01:40:23,680 --> 01:40:30,400
'You dirty rat! What do you think you are doing? 
It is a crime to break down someone else's door!'  

921
01:40:30,400 --> 01:40:36,960
shouted Pigsy. 'I remember you now...' 
he said, looking more closely at Monkey.  

922
01:40:37,920 --> 01:40:43,920
'You once lived in a cave behind a 
Water Curtain. How did you get here?'

923
01:40:45,360 --> 01:40:50,880
'I am a priest now. I am going with 
a Chinese pilgrim called Tripitaka  

924
01:40:50,880 --> 01:40:52,640
to fetch scriptures from India.'

925
01:40:54,000 --> 01:41:01,360
The fork fell from Pigsy's hand. 'Where is 
the pilgrim?' he said. 'Take me to him.'

926
01:41:02,720 --> 01:41:05,280
'Why do you want to see him?' asked Monkey.

927
01:41:06,320 --> 01:41:12,080
'The Goddess Kuan-yin put me here to prepare 
myself for the arrival of a pilgrim who I  

928
01:41:12,080 --> 01:41:19,280
must follow. After doing this, I will receive 
wisdom. I have been waiting for this pilgrim for  

929
01:41:19,280 --> 01:41:26,480
years. Why did you not tell me that you are his 
follower? Why did you prefer to fight with me?'

930
01:41:27,840 --> 01:41:34,080
'I am not so sure that your story is true. If 
you really want to follow my Master to India,  

931
01:41:34,080 --> 01:41:38,800
you must promise that this story is 
true. Then I will take you to him.'

932
01:41:40,960 --> 01:41:47,840
Pigsy threw himself down on his knees and 
bowed repeatedly. 'I promise holy Buddha, this  

933
01:41:47,840 --> 01:41:57,280
is true - every word. If it is not true, let the 
judges in Heaven cut me into ten thousand pieces.'

934
01:41:59,040 --> 01:42:05,840
'I believe you,' said Monkey, 'but give 
me your fork.' Then Monkey took a hair,  

935
01:42:06,480 --> 01:42:11,600
blew on it with his magic breath, and 
changed it into a long thick string.

936
01:42:12,640 --> 01:42:18,800
He tied Pigsy's hands behind his back, took 
him by the ear and pulled him along with him.

937
01:42:20,320 --> 01:42:25,920
When Monkey arrived at Mr Kao's farm 
with Pigsy, everyone was very happy.  

938
01:42:26,880 --> 01:42:31,760
After hearing Pigsy's story, 
Tripitaka told Monkey to untie him.  

939
01:42:32,560 --> 01:42:37,440
Tripitaka said some prayers and then 
they sat down and ate supper together.

940
01:42:38,720 --> 01:42:45,440
The next day, Tripitaka sat on the white horse 
that had been a dragon. Pigsy carried the luggage  

941
01:42:46,080 --> 01:42:50,720
and Monkey carried his cudgel, 
as they all left for the West.

942
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:57,280
At last they came to a flat country. 
Summer had passed and autumn had come,  

943
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:02,320
and now in front of them was a great, wild river.

944
01:43:05,520 --> 01:43:09,840
Monkey leapt into the air and 
looked far down into the water.

945
01:43:10,720 --> 01:43:17,760
'Master,' he reported, 'this will not be easy. 
For me, it will not be difficult because I can  

946
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:24,080
jump across in one leap, but for you it 
will be impossible. When I looked down,  

947
01:43:24,640 --> 01:43:28,480
I saw that this river is twelve 
thousand kilometres across.'  

948
01:43:30,080 --> 01:43:36,400
Tripitaka was very unhappy but, looking down, 
he saw a rock with some writing which said  

949
01:43:37,040 --> 01:43:41,280
River of Sands. Under that, in 
small letters, were the words:

950
01:43:42,080 --> 01:43:45,920
In the River of Sands, twelve thousand wide,

951
01:43:46,480 --> 01:43:50,160
In Dead Waters, fifteen thousand deep,

952
01:43:50,960 --> 01:43:53,680
Nothing will stay on the water -

953
01:43:53,680 --> 01:43:56,960
Even the lightest flower 
goes straight to the bottom.

954
01:43:59,040 --> 01:44:04,400
As they looked, a terrible creature came 
towards them through the water. His eyes  

955
01:44:04,400 --> 01:44:11,360
were like bright lights, and around his neck were 
nine heads. He rushed straight at the pilgrims.

956
01:44:12,560 --> 01:44:16,320
Monkey pushed Tripitaka to 
a safe place while Pigsy  

957
01:44:16,320 --> 01:44:20,800
attacked the creature with his 
fork. The creature fought hard  

958
01:44:20,800 --> 01:44:28,240
and the fight was a good one. Monkey was impatient 
to join in and at last, with a wild scream,  

959
01:44:28,240 --> 01:44:35,600
he leapt at the creature. As he brought his cudgel 
down on its head, it disappeared into the water.

960
01:44:36,880 --> 01:44:44,640
Pigsy was very angry. 'Brother, who asked you to 
fight my fight? That creature was just getting  

961
01:44:44,640 --> 01:44:49,840
tired and I had almost finished 
him. You have spoilt everything.'

962
01:44:51,040 --> 01:44:58,080
'I am sorry,' laughed Monkey. 'But I could 
not stand and watch. I have not used my  

963
01:44:58,080 --> 01:45:05,520
cudgel for months and I got so excited that I 
could not stop myself. I wanted to join the fun.'

964
01:45:07,040 --> 01:45:10,960
So, hand in hand, they returned to Tripitaka.

965
01:45:12,160 --> 01:45:15,840
'It will be your turn next time,' promised Pigsy.

966
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:24,320
'Thank you, but I am really not at my best in 
water,' said Monkey. 'I am happier in the clouds  

967
01:45:24,320 --> 01:45:30,240
and I have enough tricks on land. If you 
can make this creature leave the river,  

968
01:45:30,240 --> 01:45:31,520
I will come and help you.'

969
01:45:33,360 --> 01:45:37,040
Pigsy went into the river and 
discovered that he had not  

970
01:45:37,040 --> 01:45:42,240
lost his water-magic. He soon found the 
creature at the bottom of the river.

971
01:45:43,680 --> 01:45:50,560
'You ugly pig,' the creature shouted. 'Can you 
not see that I am not an ordinary creature?  

972
01:45:50,560 --> 01:45:57,840
I am a god. One day, at a banquet in Heaven, 
I accidentally broke the Jade Emperor's bowl.  

973
01:45:58,400 --> 01:46:07,760
He was very angry and I was sent down here to the 
River of Sands. When I am hungry, as I am now,  

974
01:46:07,760 --> 01:46:16,240
I eat people. You would taste very good if I 
cut you up and put some sugar and salt on you.'

975
01:46:17,280 --> 01:46:20,880
'You will not eat me! You can eat my fork!'

976
01:46:21,920 --> 01:46:30,240
So again they started fighting, and they fought 
for two hours. After that, Pigsy pretended to  

977
01:46:30,240 --> 01:46:40,080
be tired and ready to stop. When he left the water 
and climbed on to the land, the creature followed.

978
01:46:40,080 --> 01:46:45,280
'Come on,' cried Pigsy. 'With 
the hard earth under our feet,  

979
01:46:45,280 --> 01:46:48,320
we will have a better fight than we did before.'

980
01:46:49,280 --> 01:46:55,840
'I know what you are trying to do,' said the 
creature. 'You are trying to get me out of the  

981
01:46:55,840 --> 01:47:03,200
river so your friend can help you. We will go 
back in the water and finish the fight there.'

982
01:47:04,400 --> 01:47:08,720
The creature refused to move, so 
they fought on the water's edge.  

983
01:47:09,600 --> 01:47:11,600
Monkey was watching from a distance.

984
01:47:12,800 --> 01:47:17,120
'Wait here,' he said to Tripitaka, 
'while I try one of my tricks.'

985
01:47:18,960 --> 01:47:23,440
Monkey leapt into the air and jumped 
straight down at the creature.  

986
01:47:24,240 --> 01:47:28,080
But the creature saw him coming 
and ran back into the water.

987
01:47:29,680 --> 01:47:33,360
'He is probably not going to 
come out again,' Monkey said.

988
01:47:34,080 --> 01:47:38,160
'This is difficult,' said Pigsy. 
'What are we going to do?'

989
01:47:39,680 --> 01:47:42,480
'Let's go and see the Master,' said Monkey.

990
01:47:44,240 --> 01:47:52,800
They told Tripitaka, who started crying loudly. 
'We will never get across,' he said sadly.

991
01:47:53,840 --> 01:47:58,800
'Don't worry,' Monkey said. 'It 
is true that we cannot get across  

992
01:47:58,800 --> 01:48:04,560
yet. That creature is a terrible 
problem, but he is not going to stop us.'

993
01:48:06,160 --> 01:48:08,720
'What are we going to do?' asked Pigsy.

994
01:48:09,920 --> 01:48:16,000
'Pigsy,' said Monkey, 'stay here with the 
Master while I go to the Southern Ocean to  

995
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:23,600
find the Goddess Kuan-yin. This search for the 
Scriptures was her idea and she must help us now.'

996
01:48:25,360 --> 01:48:29,680
'You had better go now,' said 
Tripitaka, 'and get back here quickly.'

997
01:48:31,280 --> 01:48:36,160
Leaping through the clouds, Monkey reached 
the Southern Ocean in no time at all.  

998
01:48:37,040 --> 01:48:40,800
He found the Goddess with 
the Dragon King's daughter.

999
01:48:42,800 --> 01:48:46,640
'Why are you not looking after 
your Master?' she asked at once.

1000
01:48:47,520 --> 01:48:54,560
'When we came to the River of Sands,' said Monkey, 
'we found a creature that we cannot destroy.  

1001
01:48:54,560 --> 01:49:02,240
He is a very good fighter. My friend Pigsy tried 
hard to beat him, but he was not successful.  

1002
01:49:03,280 --> 01:49:05,040
This is why I have come to you.'

1003
01:49:06,480 --> 01:49:12,480
'Monkey, do you ever listen? It 
is the same story again and again.  

1004
01:49:13,520 --> 01:49:17,360
Why did you not say that you 
are with the Priest of T'ang?'

1005
01:49:18,560 --> 01:49:22,400
'I suppose we were too busy 
trying to catch him,' said Monkey.

1006
01:49:23,120 --> 01:49:29,120
'I put him there. I intended him to 
help the Master and his pilgrims,'  

1007
01:49:29,680 --> 01:49:36,320
said Kuan-yin. 'You did not tell him that you 
were from China and looking for the Scriptures,  

1008
01:49:36,320 --> 01:49:42,480
did you? That was your mistake. He 
is there to help you, you fool!'

1009
01:49:43,840 --> 01:49:49,760
'He is sitting at the bottom of the river 
and he is not happy,' said Monkey. 'How  

1010
01:49:49,760 --> 01:49:55,840
can I make him come out and help us? And how 
is Tripitaka going to get across the river?'

1011
01:49:57,360 --> 01:50:02,880
Kuan-yin gave a red water-bottle to 
her follower Hui-yen. She told him,

1012
01:50:03,600 --> 01:50:11,440
'Go with Monkey to the river and shout "Sandy!" 
The creature will come out at once. Take him  

1013
01:50:11,440 --> 01:50:18,640
to the Master. Then put this red water-bottle in 
the middle of the nine heads that he wears around  

1014
01:50:18,640 --> 01:50:26,560
his neck. A ship will be sent from the Gods. It 
will carry Tripitaka across the River of Sands.'

1015
01:50:28,120 --> 01:50:37,840
Hui-yen went to the river and called, 'Sandy, 
Sandy! Come out and meet the Master and his  

1016
01:50:37,840 --> 01:50:45,360
pilgrims. They are looking for the Scriptures 
and they have been here for a long time.'

1017
01:50:46,880 --> 01:50:54,160
The creature came up at once. He bowed 
politely and asked, 'Where are the pilgrims?'

1018
01:50:55,280 --> 01:50:59,360
'They are sitting over there, on 
the eastern side,' replied Hui-yen.

1019
01:51:00,400 --> 01:51:06,960
'Well,' said Sandy, looking at Pigsy, 
'that dirty creature never said a word  

1020
01:51:06,960 --> 01:51:11,680
about Scriptures and I fought 
with him for two whole days.'  

1021
01:51:12,960 --> 01:51:19,840
Then, seeing Monkey, he cried, 'Him 
too? I am not going near them.'

1022
01:51:21,280 --> 01:51:28,640
'The first is Pigsy,' said Hui-yen, 
'and the second is Monkey. They are both  

1023
01:51:28,640 --> 01:51:35,120
Tripitaka's followers and both were made 
priests by Kuan-yin. You have nothing to fear.  

1024
01:51:35,920 --> 01:51:38,560
I myself will introduce you to the Master.'

1025
01:51:40,080 --> 01:51:46,960
Sandy came out of the river, tidied himself and 
went down on his knees in front of Tripitaka.  

1026
01:51:47,680 --> 01:51:55,360
He said, 'I did not recognise you, Master, 
so forgive me for being so impolite.'

1027
01:51:56,320 --> 01:51:59,600
'You rude creature,' said Pigsy,  

1028
01:51:59,600 --> 01:52:04,400
'why did you want to fight with us, 
instead of joining us from the beginning?'

1029
01:52:05,360 --> 01:52:09,280
'Brother,' laughed Monkey, 
'don't be angry with him,  

1030
01:52:09,280 --> 01:52:14,320
because it is all our fault. We never told 
him that we are going to get the Scriptures.'

1031
01:52:15,360 --> 01:52:19,360
'Do you really want to be a priest 
in our religion?' asked Tripitaka.

1032
01:52:20,240 --> 01:52:25,120
Sandy said that he did, so Monkey 
was asked to shave Sandy's head.

1033
01:52:26,080 --> 01:52:30,960
Monkey took a knife and soon Sandy 
had no hair left on his head.

1034
01:52:32,160 --> 01:52:38,880
Sandy bowed many times in front of Tripitaka, 
but only once in front of Monkey and Pigsy.  

1035
01:52:40,080 --> 01:52:45,440
Tripitaka liked Sandy's new appearance and 
he was very pleased with his new follower.

1036
01:52:47,280 --> 01:52:51,200
'You had better be quick and start 
your boat-building,' said Hui-yen.

1037
01:52:52,560 --> 01:52:57,280
Taking the heads from his neck, Sandy 
laid them at the edge of the water  

1038
01:52:57,280 --> 01:53:02,480
in the shape of a magic square. He put 
Kuan-yin's water-bottle in the middle.  

1039
01:53:03,280 --> 01:53:08,400
At once, the heads and the bottle 
became a ship, sent by the Gods.

1040
01:53:09,440 --> 01:53:16,640
Tripitaka came down to the water and walked on to 
the holy ship. Pigsy supported him on the left,  

1041
01:53:17,200 --> 01:53:23,680
Sandy on the right. Monkey, behind him, held 
on to the white horse, which followed as well  

1042
01:53:23,680 --> 01:53:29,840
as it could. They soon arrived perfectly 
safely at the other side.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

1043
01:53:33,200 --> 01:53:34,000
CHAPTER FOUR

1044
01:53:34,960 --> 01:53:37,120
A Dead King and a Competition

1045
01:53:39,280 --> 01:53:42,640
Then Manjusri said a spell, the magician  

1046
01:53:42,640 --> 01:53:47,840
returned to his tiger shape, and the 
God rode him away over the clouds.

1047
01:53:49,840 --> 01:53:57,280
Tripitaka sat in the Great Hall of the Wood Temple 
reciting the True Scriptures. It was midnight and  

1048
01:53:57,280 --> 01:54:04,640
he was tired. Soon he lay across his reading 
desk and slept. Although his eyes were closed,  

1049
01:54:04,640 --> 01:54:11,280
he seemed to know what was happening. He heard 
a voice outside the Hall whispering 'Master.'

1050
01:54:12,720 --> 01:54:21,040
Tripitaka lifted his head. In his dream he saw 
a man who was wet from head to foot. When he  

1051
01:54:21,040 --> 01:54:28,160
looked more closely, he saw that the man was 
a king. The King told Tripitaka his story:

1052
01:54:30,560 --> 01:54:37,360
'Five years ago, the rain stopped falling, 
the grass stopped growing and all my people  

1053
01:54:37,360 --> 01:54:43,600
were dying of hunger. I prayed to the 
Gods, but still the rivers were empty.  

1054
01:54:44,560 --> 01:54:51,760
But then a magician came who could call the 
wind and the rain. I asked him to pray for rain  

1055
01:54:51,760 --> 01:55:00,080
and he did. The rain came pouring down. For the 
next two years I was very kind to this magician.  

1056
01:55:01,200 --> 01:55:06,240
Then, in spring, when the two of us were 
walking by the great water hole in my palace,  

1057
01:55:06,960 --> 01:55:14,160
I suddenly saw a white light and he pushed 
me into the hole. He covered the top of it  

1058
01:55:14,160 --> 01:55:22,720
and then made a tree grow over it. Pity me! I 
have been dead for three years and nobody knows.'

1059
01:55:24,320 --> 01:55:30,480
Tripitaka was white with fear, but at last 
he said, 'Why did nobody look for you?'

1060
01:55:31,680 --> 01:55:38,320
'Ah, with his great power the magician 
transformed himself into a man who looked like me.  

1061
01:55:38,960 --> 01:55:45,920
Now he is the king of my people. But the 
Night Spirit blew me to you and gave me  

1062
01:55:45,920 --> 01:55:51,520
hope with talk of a great Monkey King 
who can kill demons with his cudgel.'

1063
01:55:53,200 --> 01:55:56,560
'But everybody in your country 
thinks that the magician is you.  

1064
01:55:57,360 --> 01:56:01,840
My follower would be attacked if 
he tried to help,' said Tripitaka.

1065
01:56:03,120 --> 01:56:09,360
'I have a son, the Prince, who spends most 
of his time in the Palace of Golden Bells.  

1066
01:56:10,240 --> 01:56:16,720
He is not allowed to see his mother, the 
Queen, because she might say something. He  

1067
01:56:16,720 --> 01:56:23,040
knows nothing about his true father except 
that I had this piece of white jade.'

1068
01:56:24,320 --> 01:56:28,480
'But how can a poor priest like me 
get to the Palace of Golden Bells?'

1069
01:56:29,760 --> 01:56:35,440
'Tomorrow my son will hunt with three 
thousand followers, and when you give  

1070
01:56:35,440 --> 01:56:43,520
him the jade he will know what to do. But now 
I must tell my Queen everything in a dream.'

1071
01:56:46,080 --> 01:56:49,840
As he turned to go, the dead 
king hit his head on the floor  

1072
01:56:50,480 --> 01:56:56,640
and Tripitaka woke up. 'Followers!' 
he called. 'Where are my followers?'

1073
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:05,120
'Now what?' said Pigsy. 'I was happier with 
my old life, although the food was bad.  

1074
01:57:05,840 --> 01:57:10,480
Now I am woken up in the middle of 
the night to look after a priest.'

1075
01:57:11,680 --> 01:57:17,040
'I had a strange dream,' 
said Tripitaka, uncertainly.

1076
01:57:18,240 --> 01:57:25,520
Monkey then came in and said, 'Master, your 
dreams come from your waking thoughts because  

1077
01:57:25,520 --> 01:57:32,640
you worry all the time. I think only of seeing 
Buddha in the West, and no dream comes near me.'

1078
01:57:34,080 --> 01:57:37,840
But Tripitaka made Monkey 
listen to the dead king's story.

1079
01:57:39,120 --> 01:57:43,120
'Say no more,' said Monkey. 'This is work for me!'

1080
01:57:44,480 --> 01:57:51,840
'The King left this,' said Tripitaka, 
remembering, and he gave Monkey the piece of jade.

1081
01:57:52,800 --> 01:57:58,960
Dear Monkey! He pulled a hair from his 
tail, blew on it, and said a magic spell.  

1082
01:58:00,160 --> 01:58:06,080
When a beautiful small box appeared, 
he put the piece of jade in it.

1083
01:58:06,080 --> 01:58:08,720
'In the early morning,' he told Tripitaka,  

1084
01:58:09,520 --> 01:58:16,480
'read the Scriptures in the Great Hall. I 
shall transform myself into a little priest,  

1085
01:58:16,480 --> 01:58:23,600
five centimetres high, and I shall jump into the 
box with the jade. When the Prince opens the box,  

1086
01:58:24,160 --> 01:58:28,640
I shall jump out, show him the 
jade and tell him the dream.'

1087
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:34,400
Both the follower and his teacher 
were too excited to sleep that night.  

1088
01:58:35,280 --> 01:58:41,280
At last, the first light of morning came 
in the East. After giving whispered orders  

1089
01:58:41,280 --> 01:58:47,840
to Pigsy and Sandy to wait quietly for 
him, Monkey leapt into the air and flew.

1090
01:58:49,520 --> 01:58:57,760
At once, his red eyes found a walled city to the 
West. The sadness of its people hung in clouds  

1091
01:58:57,760 --> 01:59:05,760
over the city. But as Monkey was watching this sad 
sight, the gates opened and the huntsmen came out.  

1092
01:59:06,880 --> 01:59:11,440
It was clear from his fine clothes 
which huntsman was the Prince.

1093
01:59:12,960 --> 01:59:16,480
'Let me play a trick on 
him,' said Monkey to himself.

1094
01:59:18,320 --> 01:59:25,600
Dear Monkey! Coming down from his cloud, he 
transformed himself into a small woodland animal  

1095
01:59:26,240 --> 01:59:33,360
and ran in front of the Prince's horse. The Prince 
chased it and the huntsmen followed the Prince.  

1096
01:59:34,320 --> 01:59:38,160
Soon, Monkey had led all 
of them to the Wood Temple.

1097
01:59:40,160 --> 01:59:44,000
'Of course, I have known of 
this place,' said the Prince,  

1098
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:47,520
'although I have never visited it. I will go in.'

1099
01:59:48,800 --> 01:59:55,200
As the Prince and his followers went into the 
Great Hall, everybody welcomed him and bowed,  

1100
01:59:55,200 --> 02:00:02,320
except Tripitaka. The angry Prince told his 
followers to take the priest and tie him up.  

1101
02:00:03,280 --> 02:00:10,800
But Monkey, now five centimetres high and in 
the box, told the Gods to protect Tripitaka,  

1102
02:00:10,800 --> 02:00:12,640
so the huntsmen could not touch him.

1103
02:00:13,680 --> 02:00:18,880
'What magic are you using,' asked 
the Prince, 'to protect yourself?'

1104
02:00:20,160 --> 02:00:27,280
'I have no magic,' replied Tripitaka. 'I am 
only a priest from China, on the way to India  

1105
02:00:27,280 --> 02:00:33,840
to fetch the Scriptures. But in this box there 
is someone who knows something very important.'

1106
02:00:35,360 --> 02:00:41,520
As he spoke, Tripitaka opened the box 
and out leapt a very small Monkey.

1107
02:00:42,720 --> 02:00:47,280
The Prince laughed and said, 'What 
can that little creature know!'

1108
02:00:48,560 --> 02:00:55,040
But Monkey, to the great surprise of everybody, 
used his magic to return to his full size.  

1109
02:00:56,240 --> 02:01:02,800
'Prince,' he said, 'please listen to me. 
Five years ago your country had no food  

1110
02:01:02,800 --> 02:01:09,360
because no rain fell, but then a magician 
came and he brought rain. Is this true?'

1111
02:01:10,240 --> 02:01:12,800
'Yes, yes, yes. Go on!'

1112
02:01:13,760 --> 02:01:15,360
'And what happened to the magician?'

1113
02:01:16,800 --> 02:01:23,120
'Three years ago, when he and my father were 
walking in the garden, a magic wind blew a  

1114
02:01:23,120 --> 02:01:29,760
piece of jade out of the King's hand and the 
magician went back to his mountains with it.  

1115
02:01:30,560 --> 02:01:35,840
But the King, my father, still misses the 
magician and he has locked the garden.'

1116
02:01:37,680 --> 02:01:44,400
Monkey laughed, but he asked the huntsmen to move 
away so he could speak privately to the Prince.  

1117
02:01:45,440 --> 02:01:52,400
'Sir, it was your father who disappeared. The man 
in the palace is the magician who brought rain.'

1118
02:01:53,360 --> 02:01:56,160
'That is not true!' said the Prince.

1119
02:01:56,880 --> 02:01:59,920
'Here is the piece of jade,' said Monkey.

1120
02:02:00,720 --> 02:02:06,000
'You stole the jade!' shouted the 
Prince to the priest. 'Take him away!'

1121
02:02:07,120 --> 02:02:13,760
Tripitaka shouted fearfully to Monkey, 
'Oh Monkey, you fool. What have you done?'

1122
02:02:14,640 --> 02:02:23,280
'Wait!' cried Monkey. 'I am the Monkey King 
and a follower of Tripitaka. Last night  

1123
02:02:23,280 --> 02:02:27,120
in this temple your father 
came to my Master in a dream.  

1124
02:02:27,920 --> 02:02:33,040
He told him that the magician had pushed 
him into a great water hole in the palace  

1125
02:02:33,040 --> 02:02:38,480
and changed into a man who looked like 
him. He could then pretend to be the king.

1126
02:02:39,600 --> 02:02:45,040
I changed into a hunted animal to lead 
you here because I wanted to tell you  

1127
02:02:45,040 --> 02:02:52,160
this. Will you believe my story or not?' The 
young Prince did not know what to believe.  

1128
02:02:53,680 --> 02:03:00,000
'Ride home,' suggested Monkey. 'Take 
this piece of jade with you and ask  

1129
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:04,800
your mother, the Queen, if the 
present king is her husband.'

1130
02:03:06,320 --> 02:03:09,600
The young Prince agreed and 
went back to the palace.  

1131
02:03:10,640 --> 02:03:15,440
He found his mother, the Queen, still worried 
about a dream she had had the night before.

1132
02:03:17,040 --> 02:03:21,600
'Mother,' said the Prince, 'forgive 
my words before I speak them.  

1133
02:03:22,720 --> 02:03:27,440
Compare your life with my 
father in the last three years  

1134
02:03:27,440 --> 02:03:33,840
with the years before that, and tell 
me if his love is as warm today.'

1135
02:03:35,120 --> 02:03:37,760
In answer the Queen recited:

1136
02:03:39,040 --> 02:03:46,720
'Three years ago something warm and kind. These 
last three years has been as cold as ice.'

1137
02:03:48,960 --> 02:03:52,320
The Prince told his mother everything 
that he had heard that day.  

1138
02:03:53,440 --> 02:03:56,320
Then he showed her the piece of jade.

1139
02:03:57,680 --> 02:04:06,640
'Oh, my son,' said the Queen, 'when you came I 
was crying because of a dream I had last night.  

1140
02:04:06,640 --> 02:04:14,080
I dreamt I saw your father. His head was 
under water and he was dead. But his soul  

1141
02:04:14,080 --> 02:04:22,160
had visited a priest of T'ang and asked him to 
destroy the magician. He also asked him to save  

1142
02:04:22,160 --> 02:04:28,880
his own body from where it had been thrown. 
Go quickly and ask that priest to help us.'

1143
02:04:30,400 --> 02:04:33,600
The young prince ran out, jumped on his horse,  

1144
02:04:34,160 --> 02:04:41,280
rode back to the Wood Temple and asked the 
pilgrims to find his father. So the next  

1145
02:04:41,280 --> 02:04:48,560
night Monkey and Pigsy were at the gates of the 
locked Flower Garden. But Monkey had told Pigsy  

1146
02:04:48,560 --> 02:04:54,000
that there was gold at the bottom of the water 
hole. He had said nothing about the dead king.

1147
02:04:56,080 --> 02:05:00,080
Pigsy brought his fork down on the 
lock of the gates and broke it.  

1148
02:05:00,960 --> 02:05:06,240
Inside the garden, Monkey could not stop 
himself jumping and shouting happily.

1149
02:05:06,880 --> 02:05:13,120
'Brother,' said Pigsy, 'you will 
ruin us, making all that noise!'

1150
02:05:14,080 --> 02:05:17,920
'Why are you trying to make 
me nervous?' said Monkey.

1151
02:05:19,120 --> 02:05:23,520
They found the tree that the magician 
had planted on top of the hole.  

1152
02:05:24,640 --> 02:05:29,760
'Now, Pigsy, the gold is hidden 
under this tree,' said Monkey.

1153
02:05:30,800 --> 02:05:36,400
At once, the fool Pigsy hit the tree 
with his fork until it fell down.  

1154
02:05:37,280 --> 02:05:44,320
Then he used his nose to dig under it until, 
about a metre down, he found a big stone.  

1155
02:05:45,440 --> 02:05:51,280
'Brother!' he cried. 'This is 
luck. The gold will be under this.'

1156
02:05:52,720 --> 02:05:56,320
Pigsy used his nose again 
and lifted the big stone.  

1157
02:05:57,520 --> 02:06:05,840
Below it something was shining. 'That is 
the gold!' cried Pigsy. But looking closer,  

1158
02:06:05,840 --> 02:06:10,160
they saw it was the light of the 
stars and the moon in the water.

1159
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:18,560
Monkey made his cudgel grow until it was 
ten metres long, and Pigsy climbed down it.  

1160
02:06:19,600 --> 02:06:27,360
When he was in the water, he began to swim. Monkey 
called down to him, 'The gold is at the bottom.'

1161
02:06:28,720 --> 02:06:36,720
So Pigsy dived down and, opening his eyes 
again, saw a door with a sign on it that said  

1162
02:06:36,720 --> 02:06:43,840
The Palace at the Bottom of the Water Hole. 
Pigsy went in and a servant called out,  

1163
02:06:44,720 --> 02:06:50,720
'Great King, something awful has happened 
- a priest with a long nose has come in.

1164
02:06:52,320 --> 02:06:59,440
The Dragon King of the Water Hole was not 
surprised. 'That must be Pigsy,' he explained.  

1165
02:06:59,440 --> 02:07:03,600
'He has come with the Monkey King 
to find the dishonest magician.  

1166
02:07:04,640 --> 02:07:09,200
Please come in and sit down,' he called to Pigsy.

1167
02:07:11,280 --> 02:07:18,960
Pigsy, happy and wet, sat in the best 
seat and asked, 'Where is the gold?'

1168
02:07:19,920 --> 02:07:22,240
'I am sorry,' said the Dragon King,  

1169
02:07:22,960 --> 02:07:30,560
'but I live down here in this hole and never 
see the sky above. Where would I get gold from?'

1170
02:07:31,680 --> 02:07:39,840
'Oh, please!' said Pigsy. 'I know it is here 
somewhere, so you had better bring it out.'

1171
02:07:41,200 --> 02:07:46,800
'I have one thing that is of value. 
You can look,' said the Dragon King.  

1172
02:07:47,920 --> 02:07:55,840
He led Pigsy to the body of the dead king. 
Pigsy went back up to Monkey. Monkey told him  

1173
02:07:55,840 --> 02:08:02,640
that the body was better than gold. So Pigsy 
dived back down again and brought the body up.

1174
02:08:04,320 --> 02:08:08,640
Monkey looked closely at the body, 
which had been dead for three years.  

1175
02:08:09,760 --> 02:08:15,840
He asked Pigsy, 'After three years, 
how can it still look so fresh?'

1176
02:08:16,960 --> 02:08:25,680
'The Dragon King used a magic stone to keep it 
like that,' Pigsy answered. 'That was a bit of  

1177
02:08:25,680 --> 02:08:32,720
luck,' said Monkey. 'But we must still get his 
enemy and make him pay for this terrible murder.  

1178
02:08:33,520 --> 02:08:39,520
And we will be thanked for our good work. 
Quickly, Pigsy, carry the King away.'

1179
02:08:40,720 --> 02:08:43,440
'Where to?' asked Pigsy.

1180
02:08:44,400 --> 02:08:48,560
'To the temple,' said Monkey, 
'to show him to Tripitaka.'

1181
02:08:49,600 --> 02:08:53,600
'What an idea!' Pigsy complained to himself.  

1182
02:08:54,320 --> 02:09:01,040
'I was tricked into doing this job. I 
do not want to carry this dead body.'

1183
02:09:02,400 --> 02:09:05,520
'Hurry, Pigsy,' said Monkey impatiently.

1184
02:09:06,560 --> 02:09:10,880
'I am not going to carry it,' said Pigsy.

1185
02:09:11,920 --> 02:09:18,000
'If you do not want to be beaten, you 
will carry it away now,' said Monkey.

1186
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:23,280
Pigsy feared the cudgel, so he lifted 
up the dead body and put it on his back.

1187
02:09:24,080 --> 02:09:31,920
'This Monkey,' he said to himself, 'has 
played a dirty trick on me, but he will be  

1188
02:09:31,920 --> 02:09:40,160
sorry. When we get back to the temple, I will tell 
Tripitaka that Monkey can bring the dead to life.  

1189
02:09:41,200 --> 02:09:48,480
Monkey will say that he cannot. And I 
will tell Tripitaka to recite the spell.  

1190
02:09:49,440 --> 02:09:59,840
Monkey's head will hurt, but I will not be 
happy until his brains shoot out of his head.'

1191
02:09:59,840 --> 02:10:04,160
They took the body back to the 
temple and showed it to Tripitaka.  

1192
02:10:05,120 --> 02:10:07,680
He told Monkey to bring it back to life.

1193
02:10:09,360 --> 02:10:13,120
'Only Yama, King of Death, 
can do that,' said Monkey.

1194
02:10:13,760 --> 02:10:20,400
'Don't believe him!' cried Pigsy. 
'Just tighten that cap on his head.'

1195
02:10:22,160 --> 02:10:29,360
Poor Monkey! He was soon holding his head in 
great pain as Tripitaka recited the spell.  

1196
02:10:30,080 --> 02:10:33,040
The cap became tighter and tighter.

1197
02:10:34,080 --> 02:10:38,080
'But Master,' said Monkey, 
'what will happen if I fail?'

1198
02:10:39,440 --> 02:10:42,000
'If someone puts a good breath into him,  

1199
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:48,640
he will be himself again, even after 
three years under water,' said Tripitaka.

1200
02:10:50,960 --> 02:10:56,400
Pigsy at once offered his breath, but 
Tripitaka knew that it was not pure.  

1201
02:10:57,040 --> 02:11:04,080
Pigsy had eaten the bodies of humans. So 
he asked for Monkey, whose food had been  

1202
02:11:04,080 --> 02:11:12,560
only apples and food from the forest. Monkey blew 
hard into the King's mouth and his soul returned.

1203
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:19,600
Then they all went back to the city to find the 
magician who had taken the appearance of the King.  

1204
02:11:21,200 --> 02:11:24,480
When they were led to him, they refused to bow.

1205
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:30,400
'And who are you?' asked 
the false king, surprised.

1206
02:11:31,360 --> 02:11:38,000
'My Master,' said Monkey, 'is called 
Tripitaka and he is like a younger brother  

1207
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:46,400
to the Emperor of China. I am his main 
follower.' Then he told the false king  

1208
02:11:46,400 --> 02:11:52,480
about Pigsy and Sandy, but he introduced 
the true king as a temple servant.

1209
02:11:53,680 --> 02:12:00,800
The false king wanted to know more about this 
'temple servant'. He looked at the true king,  

1210
02:12:00,800 --> 02:12:06,960
who was afraid of him, but Monkey whispered, 
'It is all right! I will speak for you.'

1211
02:12:08,560 --> 02:12:14,880
Dear Monkey! He stepped forwards and cried 
to the magician in a loud, clear voice.  

1212
02:12:16,320 --> 02:12:23,440
'Oh, King, this old man has had some 
hard times in his life. Five years ago,  

1213
02:12:23,440 --> 02:12:31,280
disaster came to his family when Heaven sent no 
rain and people died because there was no water.  

1214
02:12:32,160 --> 02:12:40,480
Then from the mountains came a magician who helped 
the people. But he then destroyed this man's life.  

1215
02:12:41,120 --> 02:12:47,840
He pushed him into a great water hole in the 
palace and became a false king of the people.  

1216
02:12:48,560 --> 02:12:57,120
But I have returned life to the dead man and 
he should be king again - not this magician.'

1217
02:12:58,880 --> 02:13:02,160
The magician felt fear deep in his heart.  

1218
02:13:03,040 --> 02:13:07,760
Taking a sword from a soldier, he 
jumped on a cloud and disappeared.

1219
02:13:09,120 --> 02:13:17,040
Both Sandy and Pigsy were very angry. 'Now we 
will never be able to find him,' they shouted.

1220
02:13:18,560 --> 02:13:26,400
Dear Monkey! Telling Pigsy and Sandy to take 
good care of the Prince, the King, his ministers,  

1221
02:13:26,400 --> 02:13:34,640
the Queen and Tripitaka, he suddenly leapt into 
the clouds. Looking down, he saw the magician  

1222
02:13:34,640 --> 02:13:41,920
running to the North-east. He shouted, 'Where 
do you think you are going? Monkey has come!'

1223
02:13:42,960 --> 02:13:46,320
'Keep out of my way,' shouted the magician.

1224
02:13:48,640 --> 02:13:55,600
Monkey fought a terrible fight with his cudgel 
against the magician and his sword, but suddenly  

1225
02:13:55,600 --> 02:14:01,840
the magician escaped back to the city. 
He transformed himself into someone who  

1226
02:14:01,840 --> 02:14:08,560
looked like Tripitaka. Monkey followed 
him but did not dare use his cudgel.

1227
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:14,640
'Which is the real Tripitaka?' 
he shouted to Pigsy and Sandy.

1228
02:14:15,760 --> 02:14:20,560
'We do not know,' they 
answered. 'We have no idea.'

1229
02:14:22,080 --> 02:14:25,840
'Master, recite your spell,' called Monkey.

1230
02:14:26,960 --> 02:14:34,560
The real Tripitaka at once recited. Pigsy lifted 
up his fork as the magician flew up into the air.  

1231
02:14:35,360 --> 02:14:41,120
Dear Pigsy! He chased the magician, 
with Sandy and Monkey close behind him.

1232
02:14:42,960 --> 02:14:49,760
What a fight there was then, with three 
wild priests hitting and kicking at one  

1233
02:14:49,760 --> 02:14:57,360
terrible ugly creature again and again. In the 
end, Monkey leapt above the creature, and he  

1234
02:14:57,360 --> 02:15:05,440
was going to cut him in half with his cudgel 
when a voice said, 'Monkey, stop the fight.'

1235
02:15:07,200 --> 02:15:11,680
It was the God Manjusri. He 
had come down from Heaven  

1236
02:15:11,680 --> 02:15:16,080
with a magic mirror which showed 
demons in their true form.

1237
02:15:17,760 --> 02:15:24,240
'But I do not understand,' said Monkey. 
'In this mirror, the magician is a tiger.'

1238
02:15:25,360 --> 02:15:32,400
'Yes,' said Manjusri. 'As a magician, 
he was acting under Buddha's orders.'

1239
02:15:33,440 --> 02:15:40,640
'What!' cried Monkey. 'The magician is 
protected by Buddha! How can that be?'

1240
02:15:42,080 --> 02:15:45,520
'Let me explain,' said Manjusri.  

1241
02:15:46,640 --> 02:15:52,640
'In the beginning, the true king pleased 
Buddha so much that he sent me to fetch  

1242
02:15:52,640 --> 02:15:58,480
him to the Western Heaven. But I said 
something to the King that offended him.  

1243
02:15:59,200 --> 02:16:07,520
He told his soldiers to throw me into the river. 
Then Buddha sent this magician to throw the King  

1244
02:16:07,520 --> 02:16:14,560
into the water hole for three years. But 
now, with your help, he has been forgiven.'

1245
02:16:16,160 --> 02:16:19,360
'Yes, but the people of the city?' asked Monkey.

1246
02:16:20,400 --> 02:16:28,000
'Nothing has happened to them. During these three 
years, rain has fallen and there has been peace.'

1247
02:16:29,040 --> 02:16:31,840
'And the Queen, who has 
slept with him as his wife?'

1248
02:16:33,280 --> 02:16:40,160
'He has not been a husband to her,' was 
the answer. 'He is not a whole man.'

1249
02:16:41,840 --> 02:16:50,000
'Then take him away,' said Monkey. 'He can thank 
you for saving him.' Manjusri said a spell,  

1250
02:16:50,800 --> 02:16:56,720
the magician returned to his tiger shape, 
and the God rode him away over the clouds.

1251
02:16:58,479 --> 02:17:02,000
As the pilgrims travelled further 
on their journey to the West,  

1252
02:17:02,720 --> 02:17:06,080
they heard a noise that 
sounded like a thousand voices.

1253
02:17:07,600 --> 02:17:14,720
Dear Monkey! He leapt high into the clouds, 
looked down, and at a little distance he saw  

1254
02:17:14,720 --> 02:17:22,400
a hill outside a city. There, a great crowd of 
Buddhist priests were carrying bricks and wood  

1255
02:17:22,399 --> 02:17:28,960
for building. They were hot and tired and crying 
out to the God of Power to give them strength.

1256
02:17:30,560 --> 02:17:33,840
'They are going to build 
a temple,' thought Monkey.  

1257
02:17:34,800 --> 02:17:40,720
But suddenly the gates of the city 
opened and two Taoist priests came out.  

1258
02:17:41,760 --> 02:17:46,640
Monkey saw at once that the Buddhists 
were afraid of them. He thought,  

1259
02:17:47,280 --> 02:17:55,840
'This must be the city I have heard about. The 
religion of Buddha has been destroyed here.'

1260
02:17:55,840 --> 02:17:59,680
Monkey transformed himself into a Taoist magician,  

1261
02:18:00,479 --> 02:18:04,639
walked towards the two young 
Taoist priests and bowed low.

1262
02:18:06,240 --> 02:18:09,840
'Can a poor Taoist find food in this city?'

1263
02:18:10,479 --> 02:18:19,280
'Oh, yes,' said the priests. 'Even the King is 
pleased to give food to Taoists. Twenty years ago  

1264
02:18:19,280 --> 02:18:25,679
there was not enough food in this place 
and it was saved by three Taoist Immortals  

1265
02:18:25,680 --> 02:18:33,040
who came out of the sky. They can bring 
wind or rain or turn stones into gold.'

1266
02:18:34,560 --> 02:18:40,320
'Your king is lucky to have these 
Immortals here. I would like to meet him.'

1267
02:18:41,680 --> 02:18:48,400
'That is no problem,' said the priests. 
'But first we must count those Buddhists  

1268
02:18:48,399 --> 02:18:50,319
and check that they are working well.'

1269
02:18:51,600 --> 02:18:56,320
'But they are priests, like us! 
We should not make them work.'

1270
02:18:57,520 --> 02:19:03,840
'Well, when we had no food, the Buddhists 
prayed to Buddha with no success at all.  

1271
02:19:04,800 --> 02:19:13,440
We Taoists prayed to our gods and we were 
successful. So they are not really priests and we  

1272
02:19:13,439 --> 02:19:20,639
should really destroy their temples. But now 
they work for us as builders and cleaners.'

1273
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:25,520
'Then I cannot meet your masters,' Monkey said,  

1274
02:19:26,160 --> 02:19:31,200
'because I am looking for an uncle 
who became a Buddhist priest.'

1275
02:19:32,800 --> 02:19:36,960
'That is no problem,' they replied. 'Take our list  

1276
02:19:36,960 --> 02:19:42,560
and check while we wait here. See 
if your uncle is among our priests.'

1277
02:19:44,800 --> 02:19:48,240
As Monkey walked towards 
the priests with the list,  

1278
02:19:48,240 --> 02:19:50,880
they all went down on their knees in front of him.

1279
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:54,720
'Please don't harm us, Father!' they said.  

1280
02:19:55,359 --> 02:20:00,639
'We have all worked hard and we 
have never been ill or missed work.'

1281
02:20:01,760 --> 02:20:05,520
Monkey told them to get up. He said that they did  

1282
02:20:05,520 --> 02:20:09,680
not need to fear him - he was 
only looking for his uncle.

1283
02:20:11,200 --> 02:20:17,840
Hearing this, they all crowded near him. 
'Which of us do you want?' they asked.

1284
02:20:18,880 --> 02:20:22,400
Monkey laughed. 'You are priests!' he said.  

1285
02:20:23,280 --> 02:20:26,880
'Why do you work as servants 
instead of reading the Scriptures?'

1286
02:20:27,760 --> 02:20:35,680
'Ah, don't laugh at us,' cried the 
priests. 'Our King has chosen other masters  

1287
02:20:35,680 --> 02:20:42,720
and we do what they tell us. The three 
Immortals are very powerful and can perform  

1288
02:20:42,720 --> 02:20:51,440
a lot of magic. Now they are using magic to 
keep the King young. That is why he obeys them.'

1289
02:20:52,479 --> 02:20:55,280
'Why do you not run away?' asked Monkey.

1290
02:20:56,240 --> 02:21:00,160
'There are pictures of us 
in every part of the country  

1291
02:21:00,160 --> 02:21:07,599
and there are police everywhere. Many of us 
have taken our own lives. But the spirits  

1292
02:21:07,600 --> 02:21:15,201
tell us that one day a pilgrim will come and 
with him is a follower called the Monkey King.  

1293
02:21:15,840 --> 02:21:21,520
He will use his great powers to 
right wrongs, and he will free us.'

1294
02:21:23,439 --> 02:21:30,080
Monkey went back to the two Taoist priests. 
They asked him if he had found his relative.

1295
02:21:31,439 --> 02:21:38,879
'They are all relatives of mine,' replied 
Monkey. 'Two hundred on my father's side  

1296
02:21:38,880 --> 02:21:44,640
and three hundred on my mother's. 
I would like you to free them.'

1297
02:21:45,840 --> 02:21:48,480
'We cannot do that!' said the priests.  

1298
02:21:49,120 --> 02:21:56,880
'One or two of them can stop work if they are ill, 
but all of them? Impossible! You must be mad!'

1299
02:21:58,319 --> 02:22:04,319
'Really?' said Monkey and, taking his 
cudgel, he killed them where they stood.

1300
02:22:06,800 --> 02:22:14,080
The Buddhists came running. 'Oh, what have you 
done!' they said. 'The people will say that we  

1301
02:22:14,080 --> 02:22:22,240
killed the priests! You must come to the King 
at once and explain that you are responsible.'

1302
02:22:22,240 --> 02:22:28,080
'I am not what you think I am,' said Monkey. 
'I am the one who has come to free you.'

1303
02:22:28,880 --> 02:22:35,280
'But you are a murderer!' said the Buddhist 
priests. 'The spirits described the one who  

1304
02:22:35,280 --> 02:22:42,880
will free us. He has a flat head, bright 
red eyes, a hairy face and no chin.'

1305
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:47,680
Monkey transformed himself 
back from a Taoist priest  

1306
02:22:47,680 --> 02:22:52,080
into himself, and the Buddhists 
bowed in front of him.

1307
02:22:53,359 --> 02:23:00,479
'Now go away from here!' cried Monkey. 'But 
first I shall give you some protecting magic.'

1308
02:23:01,760 --> 02:23:05,440
Dear Monkey! He pulled out a handful of his hairs,  

1309
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:10,560
bit them into pieces and gave a 
small piece to each of the Buddhists.

1310
02:23:11,920 --> 02:23:19,920
'Put this behind your ear. If you are in any 
danger, press your ear and call out "Monkey King!"  

1311
02:23:20,800 --> 02:23:25,760
I will come at once to help you, even 
if I am thousands of kilometres away.'

1312
02:23:27,760 --> 02:23:34,720
Some of the braver priests tested the 
hairs and called out 'Monkey King!' At once  

1313
02:23:34,720 --> 02:23:41,920
a thunder god with a great cudgel appeared. 
'If you say "Quiet", he will disappear,'  

1314
02:23:41,920 --> 02:23:47,040
Monkey told them. And at the 
word 'Quiet', he disappeared.

1315
02:23:48,640 --> 02:23:53,440
'Don't go far from this place and 
there will be news for you soon,'  

1316
02:23:53,439 --> 02:23:59,839
Monkey called as the priests departed. He 
left to tell Tripitaka what had happened.

1317
02:24:01,200 --> 02:24:06,000
As the pilgrims entered the city, 
some people were afraid of them.  

1318
02:24:06,880 --> 02:24:14,080
But an old Buddhist priest recognised Monkey 
and shouted, 'I have dreamt of you, Monkey  

1319
02:24:14,080 --> 02:24:19,920
King. Thanks to you, we are not 
ghosts - we are living men.'

1320
02:24:21,680 --> 02:24:29,520
That night, Monkey's head was so full of plans for 
the next day that he could not sleep. He got up,  

1321
02:24:30,160 --> 02:24:35,840
looked down into the street and saw that the 
Taoists were all celebrating in the temple.  

1322
02:24:36,800 --> 02:24:39,200
They were led by the three Immortals.

1323
02:24:41,040 --> 02:24:44,399
At once, Monkey went to find Pigsy and Sandy.  

1324
02:24:45,520 --> 02:24:48,880
'Come and have some fun,' 
he whispered in Sandy's ear.

1325
02:24:49,920 --> 02:24:56,000
'Who wants fun in the middle of 
the night?' said Sandy, sleepily.

1326
02:24:56,000 --> 02:25:04,160
'The Taoist Temple has plenty of food in it,' 
said Monkey. 'Bread, cake, fruit, sweets...'

1327
02:25:05,200 --> 02:25:12,240
Pigsy woke up at the sound of a list of 
food. 'Brother, I am coming too,' he cried.

1328
02:25:13,280 --> 02:25:21,439
When they arrived at the temple, Pigsy could not 
wait. 'They are all still praying!' he complained.

1329
02:25:22,319 --> 02:25:25,840
'I will soon stop that,' said Monkey,  

1330
02:25:25,840 --> 02:25:32,880
and he blew hard. A great wind passed through 
the temple, blowing everything on to the ground  

1331
02:25:32,880 --> 02:25:38,720
and putting all the lights out. Frightened 
in the dark, all the Taoists ran away.

1332
02:25:39,920 --> 02:25:44,480
The three pilgrims went inside and the 
three of them finished all the food.

1333
02:25:45,680 --> 02:25:51,920
But a little Taoist remembered that he had left 
his hand-bell in the temple and went back for it.  

1334
02:25:52,880 --> 02:25:59,920
He opened the door and saw that all the food was 
gone. He ran away to fetch the three Immortals.

1335
02:26:01,040 --> 02:26:05,840
When they came, one of them thought 
that their gods had eaten the food.

1336
02:26:06,880 --> 02:26:11,920
'Let's pray to them,' the Immortal 
said, 'for long life for the King.'

1337
02:26:13,120 --> 02:26:15,519
Then Monkey jumped out and called to them.  

1338
02:26:16,160 --> 02:26:23,840
'How could you be such fools?' he said. 'We 
are not gods, we are priests from China. We  

1339
02:26:23,840 --> 02:26:29,680
have eaten all your food and your king will 
have to go somewhere else for a long life.'

1340
02:26:31,040 --> 02:26:33,840
The Taoist Immortals attacked the pilgrims,  

1341
02:26:34,479 --> 02:26:41,120
but Monkey took Sandy in one hand and Pigsy in 
the other and leapt on to a cloud with them.  

1342
02:26:42,160 --> 02:26:48,559
In no time, they were back in their beds, in the 
hotel where they were staying with Tripitaka.

1343
02:26:50,080 --> 02:26:57,040
Next day, the King was very angry when he heard 
that three Buddhist pilgrims wanted to see him.  

1344
02:26:57,920 --> 02:27:00,000
But one of his ministers stepped forward.

1345
02:27:01,439 --> 02:27:06,639
'The country of T'ang is fifty 
thousand kilometres away,' he said.  

1346
02:27:07,600 --> 02:27:14,640
'If they really come from there, they 
must have magic powers. Let's hear them.'

1347
02:27:15,600 --> 02:27:18,720
So the King allowed the pilgrims to come in,  

1348
02:27:19,920 --> 02:27:26,560
but before they could speak, three important 
Taoists came in and made a report to the King.

1349
02:27:27,520 --> 02:27:34,320
'Yesterday,' they said, 'these three killed two 
of our followers and helped five hundred Buddhist  

1350
02:27:34,319 --> 02:27:40,160
priests to escape. That night, they went 
into our temple and ate all the food.'

1351
02:27:41,439 --> 02:27:46,160
The angry King ordered the immediate 
death of the three pilgrims.  

1352
02:27:46,800 --> 02:27:53,280
But before anyone could do anything about the 
order, some men arrived asking urgently for rain.  

1353
02:27:54,479 --> 02:27:57,839
The King thought about the pilgrims' magic powers.

1354
02:27:59,040 --> 02:28:05,680
'There will be a rain-making competition between 
you and the Immortals,' he said to the pilgrims.  

1355
02:28:06,319 --> 02:28:11,840
'If you win, you will go free. 
If you lose, you will die!'

1356
02:28:12,640 --> 02:28:18,480
A tower was quickly built and the King, the 
pilgrims and the Immortals went outside.

1357
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:24,160
'You must say what you are going to 
pray for,' said Monkey to an Immortal.  

1358
02:28:24,800 --> 02:28:27,120
'How else will we know if you are successful?'

1359
02:28:28,800 --> 02:28:35,120
When the King heard Monkey's words, he said, 
'This little priest is a sensible Monkey.'

1360
02:28:36,640 --> 02:28:41,760
'There is no need to tell you,' said the 
Immortal. 'The King knows what I am going to do.'

1361
02:28:43,200 --> 02:28:50,319
'That is not what I mean. We must each have our 
programme. If we do not, we will get confused.'

1362
02:28:50,960 --> 02:28:59,280
'Yes, fine. I shall cry out four times,' said 
the Immortal. 'At the first cry, wind will come;  

1363
02:28:59,280 --> 02:29:05,840
at the second, clouds will appear in the 
sky; at the third, you will hear thunder;  

1364
02:29:06,479 --> 02:29:13,280
at the fourth, rain will fall. But I shall 
cry out once more and the rain will stop.'

1365
02:29:14,880 --> 02:29:19,440
'Please begin,' said Monkey. 'This 
will be very entertaining for us.'

1366
02:29:20,960 --> 02:29:27,040
The tower was ten metres high. On each side 
there were the twenty-eight flags of the Great  

1367
02:29:27,040 --> 02:29:33,359
House of the Moon. There was a long table with 
burners on it, which gave a sweet-smelling smoke.  

1368
02:29:34,160 --> 02:29:38,479
There was a metal plate with the name 
of the thunder-spirit written on it  

1369
02:29:38,479 --> 02:29:45,519
next to each burner. At the foot of the table 
there were five great bowls of clear water  

1370
02:29:45,520 --> 02:29:53,121
with flowers in them. Behind the tower were 
some Taoists writing down religious teachings.

1371
02:29:55,120 --> 02:29:58,640
The Immortal went to the 
tower and climbed to the top.  

1372
02:29:59,520 --> 02:30:07,440
With his sword in his hand, he recited spells, and 
a strong wind was heard and felt in the air above.

1373
02:30:08,720 --> 02:30:13,200
'That is bad,' whispered Pigsy. 'He is winning.'

1374
02:30:14,160 --> 02:30:17,840
'Quiet, Brother,' whispered 
Monkey, 'and leave it to me.'

1375
02:30:19,040 --> 02:30:25,280
Dear Monkey! He leapt into the air and 
cried, 'Who is in charge of the wind?'

1376
02:30:26,240 --> 02:30:29,679
At once, the Old Woman of the Wind appeared.

1377
02:30:30,880 --> 02:30:36,720
'I am protecting Tripitaka on his way 
to India,' said Monkey. 'We are having  

1378
02:30:36,720 --> 02:30:42,720
a rain-making competition with the Immortals 
here. Why are you helping them instead of us?  

1379
02:30:43,439 --> 02:30:49,919
Stop that wind!' cried Monkey, 
and immediately the wind stopped.

1380
02:30:51,680 --> 02:30:57,120
The Immortal now hit the tower hard 
and the sky filled with clouds.

1381
02:30:58,720 --> 02:31:04,800
'Who is in charge of the clouds?' cried Monkey, 
and the Cloud Boy appeared in front of him.  

1382
02:31:05,680 --> 02:31:10,880
'Stop the clouds!' he commanded, 
and again the sky became clear.

1383
02:31:12,080 --> 02:31:18,720
The Immortal loosened his hair and then 
knocked again on the tower. The Thunder God  

1384
02:31:18,720 --> 02:31:23,920
and the Mother of Lightning appeared in 
the sky, but they bowed towards Monkey.

1385
02:31:25,200 --> 02:31:30,080
'The Jade Emperor in Heaven,' they 
said, 'ordered us to make a storm.'

1386
02:31:30,880 --> 02:31:34,480
'You are allowed to do that,' 
said Monkey, 'but not yet.'

1387
02:31:36,640 --> 02:31:42,640
As there was no thunder and no lightning, 
the Immortal was confused as well as angry.

1388
02:31:44,160 --> 02:31:51,280
'Listen well,' said Monkey, up in the sky. 
'Here are my orders. When I point my cudgel  

1389
02:31:51,280 --> 02:31:59,759
upwards once, you will give me wind. Twice, and 
you will give me clouds. Three times, thunder  

1390
02:31:59,760 --> 02:32:08,240
and lightning. And four times, rain. 'And when I 
point it a fifth time, you will stop the storm.'

1391
02:32:09,680 --> 02:32:14,241
The Immortal sadly left the tower 
and went to speak to the King.

1392
02:32:15,840 --> 02:32:23,840
'I have been watching,' said the King. 'You have 
not produced either wind or rain. What is wrong?'

1393
02:32:24,880 --> 02:32:29,120
'The rain-dragons are not at 
home today,' said the Immortal.

1394
02:32:30,319 --> 02:32:37,439
'Don't believe him!' cried Monkey. 'They are 
all at home. That Immortal has no real power  

1395
02:32:37,439 --> 02:32:44,080
over them. We, the followers of Buddha, 
will soon put them to work. You will see!'

1396
02:32:45,600 --> 02:32:52,480
'Go to the tower,' said the King to Monkey. 'I 
will wait here and see if there is any rain.'

1397
02:32:53,760 --> 02:32:57,281
'I need your help too,' said Monkey to Tripitaka.  

1398
02:32:57,920 --> 02:33:01,920
'Go quietly to the tower and 
start reciting your Scriptures.'

1399
02:33:02,880 --> 02:33:08,640
'My dear friend,' said Tripitaka, 'I do 
not know anything about making rain!'

1400
02:33:09,920 --> 02:33:12,560
'Don't let him pull you into this,'  

1401
02:33:12,560 --> 02:33:18,480
whispered Pigsy to Tripitaka. 'He 
will blame you if no rain comes.'

1402
02:33:19,520 --> 02:33:26,000
'It is true that you do not know how to 
make rain,' said Monkey to Tripitaka. 'But  

1403
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:31,280
you know how to recite the Scriptures. 
If you do that, I will do the rest.'

1404
02:33:32,720 --> 02:33:39,120
Tripitaka went up the tower, sat 
down and began silently reciting.  

1405
02:33:40,319 --> 02:33:43,519
Then Monkey took his cudgel from behind his ear,  

1406
02:33:44,160 --> 02:33:50,080
and made it bigger until it was nearly a 
metre long. He pointed it towards the sky.

1407
02:33:51,520 --> 02:34:00,081
The Old Woman of the Wind brought out her bag and 
when she opened it, a great wind rushed out of it.  

1408
02:34:00,080 --> 02:34:08,479
It blew through the city, lifting stones and rocks 
high into the air. Monkey pointed again and a  

1409
02:34:08,479 --> 02:34:16,559
black cloud covered the sky, so the people of the 
city could not even see their palace. He pointed  

1410
02:34:16,560 --> 02:34:25,600
again and loud thunder shook the Earth. When he 
pointed a fourth time, rain fell down until it  

1411
02:34:25,600 --> 02:34:33,920
seemed that the Yellow River had fallen out of the 
sky. In seconds, the whole city was under water.

1412
02:34:34,880 --> 02:34:38,240
The people of the city were filled with terror  

1413
02:34:38,240 --> 02:34:45,280
and they all began saying their prayers. The 
rain fell from early morning until midday.

1414
02:34:46,240 --> 02:34:52,399
'Enough!' cried the King. 'Stop the 
rain or nothing will grow this year!'

1415
02:34:54,160 --> 02:34:58,080
Monkey at once pointed a 
fifth time with his cudgel  

1416
02:34:58,800 --> 02:35:03,920
and the storm stopped. There 
was not even a cloud in the sky.

1417
02:35:05,520 --> 02:35:15,281
'Wonderful priests!' cried the happy King. 'So 
it is true! There is always a stronger magic  

1418
02:35:15,280 --> 02:35:25,599
than the strongest! In the past we have seen our 
Immortals bring rain successfully. But even they  

1419
02:35:25,600 --> 02:35:32,560
could not stop it suddenly. Light rain 
always continued for the rest of the day.  

1420
02:35:33,200 --> 02:35:37,840
But these priests stopped the rain completely!'

1421
02:35:39,600 --> 02:35:42,000
The Immortal began making excuses.

1422
02:35:43,040 --> 02:35:46,800
'You said that the rain-dragons were not at home,'  

1423
02:35:46,800 --> 02:35:51,280
the King said, 'and that made 
it impossible to get rain.  

1424
02:35:51,280 --> 02:36:00,399
But look! The Buddhists, in their quiet way, made 
the rain fall. They were successful, not you.'

1425
02:36:01,359 --> 02:36:05,280
Again, the Immortal tried 
to change the King's mind,  

1426
02:36:05,280 --> 02:36:08,800
but Monkey jumped in front 
of him and spoke to the King.

1427
02:36:09,840 --> 02:36:16,560
'Sir, the Dragon Kings made the wind, the 
clouds and the rain. They are still in the sky,  

1428
02:36:17,280 --> 02:36:18,719
so would you like to see them?'

1429
02:36:19,439 --> 02:36:28,639
'Of course!' cried the King. 'I have been king 
for a long time, but I have never seen a dragon. I  

1430
02:36:28,640 --> 02:36:37,440
will reward anyone who can show me one. But if you 
do not produce a dragon, you will be punished.'

1431
02:36:38,640 --> 02:36:42,560
The Taoists knew quite well that 
this was beyond their powers.  

1432
02:36:43,439 --> 02:36:49,839
They tried, but no dragon answered 
their call. Then it was Monkey's turn.

1433
02:36:51,280 --> 02:36:58,080
'Are you there?' Monkey called up into the sky. 
'Let's have a look at you and your brothers.'

1434
02:36:59,359 --> 02:37:05,439
When the four Dragon Kings immediately 
appeared through the clouds, the King began  

1435
02:37:05,439 --> 02:37:12,160
to burn sweet-smelling sticks. His ministers 
went down on their knees in front of them.

1436
02:37:13,120 --> 02:37:21,680
'I feel ashamed,' said the King. 'I have 
troubled them for no reason. Tell them that  

1437
02:37:21,680 --> 02:37:31,840
I do not want to trouble them anymore. I will find 
an opportunity to repay them soon with offerings.'

1438
02:37:32,640 --> 02:37:35,201
'Spirits, you can leave us now,'  

1439
02:37:35,920 --> 02:37:42,319
said Monkey. 'The King will repay you with 
offerings at the earliest opportunity.'

1440
02:37:44,080 --> 02:37:50,240
The Dragons flew off, each to his own 
ocean, and again the sky was clear.

1441
02:37:51,439 --> 02:37:58,000
The King gave orders for a banquet the next day, 
to thank the pilgrims. All the Buddhists were  

1442
02:37:58,000 --> 02:38:04,160
invited to return to the city, and they were 
welcomed to the banquet by the King himself.

1443
02:38:05,520 --> 02:38:11,121
After the banquet, the Buddhist priests 
took the pilgrims to the gates of the city,  

1444
02:38:11,680 --> 02:38:19,920
and they gave Monkey back the hairs he had 
given them. Then Monkey said, 'Now you can see  

1445
02:38:20,479 --> 02:38:27,839
that Buddhism is the True Way, but you 
must obey all priests - Taoist priests  

1446
02:38:27,840 --> 02:38:34,800
too - and become better men. Then these 
hills and streams will be safe forever.'

1447
02:38:36,479 --> 02:38:40,479
The King himself rode out with the pilgrims  

1448
02:38:40,479 --> 02:38:44,319
far beyond the city's walls, where 
they said goodbye.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

1449
02:38:47,280 --> 02:38:48,160
CHAPTER FIVE

1450
02:38:49,040 --> 02:38:50,399
The River to Heaven

1451
02:38:52,640 --> 02:38:56,720
'What has happened to Tripitaka?' 
shouted Monkey from the air.

1452
02:38:57,520 --> 02:39:02,400
'There is no Tripitaka now!' Pigsy shouted back.

1453
02:39:04,960 --> 02:39:10,480
They travelled without stopping for 
many days. Then Tripitaka stopped his  

1454
02:39:10,479 --> 02:39:16,959
horse and said to Monkey, 'Follower, 
when and where are we going to rest?'

1455
02:39:18,080 --> 02:39:25,920
'Comfort,' answered Monkey, 'is for ordinary 
people, so pilgrims cannot expect it. By day  

1456
02:39:25,920 --> 02:39:32,240
or by night, in wet or dry weather, if there 
is a road to travel, we must continue.'

1457
02:39:34,319 --> 02:39:39,200
Soon Sandy shouted, 'There is 
a great river in front of us!'

1458
02:39:40,399 --> 02:39:45,759
'Wait here!' cried Monkey, leaping 
high into the air. Soon he was back.  

1459
02:39:46,960 --> 02:39:53,600
'I cannot see land on the other side,' he 
said, 'but I thought I saw a fisherman. He  

1460
02:39:53,600 --> 02:39:57,680
was standing at the water's edge. 
I will ask him about the river.'

1461
02:39:59,200 --> 02:40:01,920
But it was not a fisherman that Monkey had seen.  

1462
02:40:02,720 --> 02:40:09,840
It was a sign that said: The River That Leads to 
Heaven. Few people have reached the other side.

1463
02:40:11,200 --> 02:40:14,720
When Tripitaka read this, he cried quietly.  

1464
02:40:15,680 --> 02:40:22,560
'I knew so little of the difficulties in 
our way, on the road to India,' he said.

1465
02:40:23,439 --> 02:40:30,559
'Listen,' said Pigsy. 'That music means there 
are priests praying somewhere near here.  

1466
02:40:31,279 --> 02:40:34,719
They will tell us how we 
can get across the river.'

1467
02:40:36,240 --> 02:40:40,800
Following the sound, they soon 
saw a village of several hundred  

1468
02:40:40,800 --> 02:40:46,080
houses. One of them had a flag 
at its gate and lights outside.

1469
02:40:46,760 --> 02:40:50,320
'I shall go in first,' said Tripitaka,  

1470
02:40:51,040 --> 02:40:56,800
'because you three look a little strange 
and I do not want people to be frightened.'

1471
02:40:58,479 --> 02:41:03,200
An old man came to the door and 
when he saw Tripitaka he said,  

1472
02:41:03,760 --> 02:41:10,720
'You have come a little late. The banquet is 
almost finished and there is not much to eat.'

1473
02:41:11,920 --> 02:41:16,000
'I did not come for the 
banquet,' answered Tripitaka.  

1474
02:41:16,000 --> 02:41:21,040
'I have come from China and I would like 
a bed for the night if that is possible.'

1475
02:41:21,920 --> 02:41:27,359
'China is a very long way away,' said the old man,  

1476
02:41:27,359 --> 02:41:32,479
whose name was Ch'en. 'How do I 
know that your words are true?'

1477
02:41:33,840 --> 02:41:36,480
'My three followers have helped me on the journey.  

1478
02:41:37,120 --> 02:41:39,920
They have made it possible 
for me to travel so far.'

1479
02:41:40,880 --> 02:41:44,720
'Well, they had better come in with you.'

1480
02:41:46,640 --> 02:41:51,760
The three pilgrims came rushing in out 
of the dark, leading the white horse,  

1481
02:41:51,760 --> 02:42:01,600
carrying the luggage and shouting. The old man 
fell on the floor, crying, 'Demons! Help! Demons!'

1482
02:42:02,800 --> 02:42:09,600
'Not demons,' said Tripitaka, 'but 
my followers. I know they are ugly,  

1483
02:42:09,600 --> 02:42:14,720
but they are very good at fighting 
tigers, dragons and other creatures.'

1484
02:42:16,160 --> 02:42:22,559
A group of praying priests jumped up 
and ran away in fear. The pilgrims  

1485
02:42:22,560 --> 02:42:26,800
laughed so loudly at this that 
the priests ran even faster.

1486
02:42:28,000 --> 02:42:35,920
'You fools!' cried Tripitaka to his followers. 
'I have tried so hard to teach you to behave  

1487
02:42:35,920 --> 02:42:42,640
correctly! Learn this: It is admirable 
to be good without being taught.  

1488
02:42:43,200 --> 02:42:51,200
It is normal to be good after being taught. 
Only a fool is taught and then is still  

1489
02:42:51,200 --> 02:42:56,319
bad. Do you not understand that I 
will have to take the blame for this?'

1490
02:42:57,680 --> 02:43:04,400
The three stood silently, so the old man believed 
that they really were followers of Tripitaka.  

1491
02:43:05,680 --> 02:43:09,040
He sat Tripitaka in the best place at the table,  

1492
02:43:09,600 --> 02:43:16,480
and food was brought for them all. Tripitaka 
began to recite the Scripture Before Eating,  

1493
02:43:17,120 --> 02:43:23,359
but Pigsy poured all the food into his mouth 
from the bowl before Tripitaka had finished.

1494
02:43:24,479 --> 02:43:35,279
As Pigsy was calling 'More food, more food' to the 
servants, the old man spoke to Tripitaka. 'Did you  

1495
02:43:35,279 --> 02:43:44,080
read the sign by the river? You were quite near 
the Temple of the Great King of Magic,' he said.  

1496
02:43:44,800 --> 02:43:54,960
'He is the god who sends us rain. He makes things 
grow.' But as he spoke, he began to cry loudly.

1497
02:43:56,240 --> 02:44:00,319
'Why are you crying when you 
speak of the God?' asked Monkey.

1498
02:44:01,760 --> 02:44:11,120
'That god is an angry god and every year he 
takes the life of a boy and a girl, so we have  

1499
02:44:11,120 --> 02:44:20,960
few children here. I have one child, a son called 
War Boy, and my brother has one girl, called  

1500
02:44:20,960 --> 02:44:28,880
Much Gold. This year our family must give the 
children to the God and both of them must die.'

1501
02:44:30,720 --> 02:44:33,040
'Let me see the boy,' said Monkey.

1502
02:44:34,319 --> 02:44:41,279
The boy was brought down from his bed and 
ran around eating fruit. Without a word,  

1503
02:44:41,279 --> 02:44:45,840
Monkey transformed himself into a 
boy who looked exactly the same.

1504
02:44:46,640 --> 02:44:54,880
'That is unbelievable,' cried the father. 
'Look! When I call, both come running to me.'

1505
02:44:56,560 --> 02:45:03,440
Monkey then changed back to his own form. 'I 
am going to save this child's life,' he said  

1506
02:45:03,439 --> 02:45:08,799
to the father. 'I will let the Great 
King of Magic kill me for the gods.'

1507
02:45:09,840 --> 02:45:13,840
The old man's brother was standing 
in the doorway, watching and crying.

1508
02:45:15,040 --> 02:45:18,800
'I think you are worried about 
your daughter,' said Monkey.

1509
02:45:20,080 --> 02:45:24,399
'Father,' said the old man, 'I cannot lose her.  

1510
02:45:24,399 --> 02:45:28,639
She is my only child. Who 
will cry for me when I die?'

1511
02:45:30,319 --> 02:45:36,399
Monkey pointed at Pigsy. 'If you feed that 
long-nosed brother of mine enough,' he said,  

1512
02:45:37,040 --> 02:45:40,240
'he will transform himself into your girl  

1513
02:45:40,240 --> 02:45:46,559
and do anything else you ask. The Great 
King of Magic can kill us both together.'

1514
02:45:47,840 --> 02:45:52,640
Pigsy was shocked. 'Leave 
me out of this!' he said.

1515
02:45:53,439 --> 02:45:59,040
'You know what they say,' said Monkey. 
"'Even a chicken must work for its food.'"

1516
02:46:00,160 --> 02:46:08,720
'I am no good at transformations,' complained 
Pigsy. 'I can change into a mountain or a tree,  

1517
02:46:09,359 --> 02:46:14,000
but it is much more difficult 
to change into a small girl.'

1518
02:46:15,200 --> 02:46:19,840
'Don't believe him,' said Monkey to 
the girl's father. 'Bring your child.'

1519
02:46:21,520 --> 02:46:28,241
Soon the man returned with his child, and all 
the priests and servants asked Pigsy to save her.

1520
02:46:29,520 --> 02:46:33,920
'Here she is,' said Monkey. 
'Have a look and be quick.'

1521
02:46:34,960 --> 02:46:43,600
The fool Pigsy shook his head, said 
a spell and cried 'Change!' His head  

1522
02:46:43,600 --> 02:46:48,640
was now the same as the child's but 
his big stomach had not changed.

1523
02:46:49,520 --> 02:46:57,041
'You can hit me if you like,' complained 
Pigsy, 'but I cannot do any better than that.'

1524
02:46:58,640 --> 02:47:02,320
'I can see that I will have to help,' said Monkey.  

1525
02:47:02,319 --> 02:47:07,759
And he blew on Pigsy, who was soon 
like the child from head to foot.

1526
02:47:09,279 --> 02:47:13,599
'What happens now?' asked Monkey. 
'How are we brought to the God?'

1527
02:47:14,640 --> 02:47:22,080
The girl's father came forward. 'It is quite 
simple,' he said. 'You sit in two dishes,  

1528
02:47:22,960 --> 02:47:28,880
two men carry you to the temple, and 
then the Great King of Magic eats you.'

1529
02:47:30,160 --> 02:47:36,479
'Watch me,' Monkey said to Pigsy. 'While he 
is cutting me into pieces, you can run away.'

1530
02:47:37,439 --> 02:47:41,519
'But he might begin with the girl!' cried Pigsy.

1531
02:47:42,479 --> 02:47:49,439
'No,' said War Boy's father quietly. 
'The meal always begins with the boy.'

1532
02:47:50,399 --> 02:47:53,839
'Well, that is lucky,' said Pigsy.

1533
02:47:55,040 --> 02:48:00,640
Suddenly, they all saw lights outside and 
heard the sound of voices as the gate opened.  

1534
02:48:01,359 --> 02:48:06,559
A loud voice cried, 'Bring 
out the boy and the girl!'

1535
02:48:08,720 --> 02:48:14,560
The two fathers cried while the Great King's 
servants carried the boy and the girl away.

1536
02:48:15,600 --> 02:48:19,600
'Great King,' said the villagers, 
when everything was ready,  

1537
02:48:20,160 --> 02:48:26,880
'we now offer you a boy child, War 
Boy, and a girl child, Much Gold,  

1538
02:48:27,439 --> 02:48:33,439
with a pig, a sheep and some wine.' 
They then went back to their homes.

1539
02:48:34,319 --> 02:48:37,840
'I think I will go home too,' said Pigsy.

1540
02:48:38,640 --> 02:48:42,560
'You have no home,' said 
Monkey. 'What rubbish you talk!  

1541
02:48:43,120 --> 02:48:46,479
We have started this job and 
now we have to finish it.'

1542
02:48:48,000 --> 02:48:55,200
Just then, a strong wind blew through the 
door, and as it opened the Great King appeared.  

1543
02:48:55,200 --> 02:49:01,200
He was a horrible creature, with 
eyes like fire and teeth like a pig.

1544
02:49:02,880 --> 02:49:07,520
'Which family do you come 
from?' asked the Great King.

1545
02:49:08,880 --> 02:49:12,240
'The family of Ch'en,' answered Monkey.

1546
02:49:12,240 --> 02:49:17,840
The King did not understand why the 
boy was so brave. Usually the children  

1547
02:49:17,840 --> 02:49:20,640
were too frightened to talk 
before they were killed.

1548
02:49:21,520 --> 02:49:25,840
'You understand that I am now going to eat you?'

1549
02:49:27,040 --> 02:49:28,720
'Do it!' said Monkey.

1550
02:49:30,000 --> 02:49:38,000
'You are too brave,' said the Great King. 
'This time I shall begin with the girl.'

1551
02:49:38,880 --> 02:49:45,440
'No, no!' said Pigsy. 'It is never 
a good idea to change an old custom.  

1552
02:49:46,000 --> 02:49:49,600
Do what you usually do - that is always best.'

1553
02:49:50,880 --> 02:49:57,600
The fool leapt off his dish, changed back into 
Pigsy, took his fork and hit the Great King.  

1554
02:49:58,399 --> 02:50:01,120
Then he and Monkey leapt into the air,  

1555
02:50:01,120 --> 02:50:05,920
just as the Great King changed into a 
wind and disappeared into the river.

1556
02:50:07,359 --> 02:50:14,799
'Oh, let him go now,' said Monkey. 'We will finish 
him tomorrow and get our Master across the river.'

1557
02:50:16,240 --> 02:50:22,319
So they returned to Ch'en's farm, where they 
were soon asleep in the best room in the house.

1558
02:50:23,840 --> 02:50:30,160
But under the river, the Great King was unhappy. 
He told his fish-servants what had happened.  

1559
02:50:30,960 --> 02:50:38,160
He told them about Tripitaka, who was like a 
god. If somebody ate him, they would never die.

1560
02:50:39,520 --> 02:50:47,920
The Great King's fish-sister made a suggestion. 
'Start a cold wind and a great fall of snow,  

1561
02:50:48,479 --> 02:50:55,279
so the river freezes. Then some of us will 
change into human form and walk across it,  

1562
02:50:55,279 --> 02:51:04,319
carrying luggage. Tripitaka is in such a hurry to 
get to India that he will walk across it too. When  

1563
02:51:04,319 --> 02:51:12,399
you hear him above you, heat the ice. The pilgrims 
will fall through it and you will have them all.'

1564
02:51:14,399 --> 02:51:23,279
Just before the sun came up, Tripitaka and 
his followers began to feel cold. 'Pilgrims,'  

1565
02:51:23,279 --> 02:51:26,880
said Monkey, 'should not 
feel either heat or cold.'

1566
02:51:27,920 --> 02:51:34,160
But they could not sleep, and when they looked 
out of the window everything was white. The  

1567
02:51:34,160 --> 02:51:41,519
snow was so lovely that they sat and watched it 
fall. It was like small pieces of white jade.

1568
02:51:42,960 --> 02:51:49,600
Soon servants brought them hot water to wash 
in, hot tea to drink and hot food to eat.  

1569
02:51:50,640 --> 02:51:56,560
They even brought heaters for the rooms, but when 
the meal was finished the pilgrims were colder  

1570
02:51:56,560 --> 02:52:05,121
than ever. By now there was nearly a metre of snow 
outside and, seeing this, Tripitaka began to cry.

1571
02:52:07,120 --> 02:52:10,640
But towards evening everyone 
was talking about the river.  

1572
02:52:11,279 --> 02:52:17,359
It had frozen and people were walking 
on the ice. The next morning the ice was  

1573
02:52:17,359 --> 02:52:24,319
even thicker and Tripitaka gave thanks to the 
Gods for this chance to walk across the river.

1574
02:52:26,000 --> 02:52:29,520
'Master,' said Sandy, 'should we not wait  

1575
02:52:29,520 --> 02:52:35,201
until the ice goes away? Then we can go 
across the river in Mr Ch'en's boat.'

1576
02:52:36,240 --> 02:52:43,599
'But if we wait until the spring,' said Tripitaka, 
'we will lose half a year's travelling. I promised  

1577
02:52:43,600 --> 02:52:49,840
the Goddess Kuan-yin that the journey would 
take three years. Already seven have passed.'

1578
02:52:51,920 --> 02:52:55,840
He ordered Pigsy to put the luggage 
on the horse, and they left.

1579
02:52:57,359 --> 02:53:00,960
When they had gone fifteen or 
twenty kilometres across the ice,  

1580
02:53:01,520 --> 02:53:06,241
Pigsy showed Tripitaka how to 
carry his stick across his body.

1581
02:53:07,680 --> 02:53:10,960
'Ice often has holes in it,' he explained.  

1582
02:53:11,520 --> 02:53:18,720
'If you put your foot in a hole, you will go 
down into the water. It will close above you  

1583
02:53:18,720 --> 02:53:25,920
and you will never get out again. Carry your 
stick across your body and you will feel safer.'

1584
02:53:27,200 --> 02:53:31,439
Monkey looked disbelieving, but 
they all did as Pigsy had said.

1585
02:53:32,560 --> 02:53:38,000
They rode all night until the sun 
began to come up. Then they stopped to  

1586
02:53:38,000 --> 02:53:42,560
eat some food from their luggage 
and then continued towards the West.

1587
02:53:43,840 --> 02:53:49,600
But after some time, the ice began to 
break and the white horse almost fell.  

1588
02:53:50,800 --> 02:53:57,760
They continued walking, not knowing that the Great 
King and his fish-followers were waiting below.  

1589
02:53:59,040 --> 02:54:05,840
Suddenly, a great hole opened in the ice. 
Monkey at once leapt high into the air,  

1590
02:54:06,560 --> 02:54:12,800
but the white horse and all the 
others fell through it. The Great King  

1591
02:54:12,800 --> 02:54:19,840
took Tripitaka and carried him down 
to the Great Palace under the water.

1592
02:54:21,359 --> 02:54:25,120
'Where is my fish-sister?' said the Great King.  

1593
02:54:25,760 --> 02:54:32,080
'Come, fetch the sharp knives. Let's 
eat Tripitaka and live forever.'

1594
02:54:32,840 --> 02:54:41,279
'Great King,' answered the Fish-Sister. 'Let's 
wait for a couple of days until we can be sure  

1595
02:54:41,279 --> 02:54:44,080
that his followers cannot spoil our fun.'

1596
02:54:45,520 --> 02:54:52,720
The King agreed, and Tripitaka was put in a 
great stone box at the back of the palace.

1597
02:54:54,240 --> 02:55:00,399
At the same time, Pigsy and Sandy had 
managed to get the luggage out of the water  

1598
02:55:00,399 --> 02:55:05,759
and put it on to the horse's back. They 
started swimming back the way they had come.

1599
02:55:07,359 --> 02:55:11,519
'What has happened to Tripitaka?' 
shouted Monkey from the air.

1600
02:55:12,399 --> 02:55:20,719
'There is no Tripitaka now!' Pigsy shouted 
back. 'We are going back to Ch'en's farm.'

1601
02:55:27,920 --> 02:55:33,760
Mr Ch'en cried uncontrollably when he 
heard what had happened to Tripitaka.

1602
02:55:35,200 --> 02:55:40,080
'Don't worry,' said Monkey. 'I think 
the Master will live for a long time.  

1603
02:55:41,040 --> 02:55:45,680
Let's dry our clothes and then we will 
go back and finish that creature!'

1604
02:55:47,680 --> 02:55:54,880
Back at the river, Monkey asked Pigsy to carry 
him down while Sandy swam behind them. And at  

1605
02:55:54,880 --> 02:56:00,400
the bottom of the river they found a gate 
with the sign Turtle House written on it.

1606
02:56:01,760 --> 02:56:10,000
Monkey whispered, 'You two hide at each side of 
the door!' Then he changed himself into a fish and  

1607
02:56:10,000 --> 02:56:17,279
swam inside. The Great King and his fish-followers 
were talking about eating Tripitaka,  

1608
02:56:18,000 --> 02:56:25,840
but Monkey could not see his Master. Then he 
heard Tripitaka crying inside a stone box.

1609
02:56:26,880 --> 02:56:31,040
'Don't worry,' said Monkey, 
'we will soon get you out.'

1610
02:56:32,160 --> 02:56:37,599
'Be quick! Oh, be quick!' cried 
Tripitaka from inside his box.

1611
02:56:38,399 --> 02:56:46,000
'I am going now,' said Monkey, 'but I 
shall return.' And soon he and Pigsy  

1612
02:56:46,000 --> 02:56:48,319
and Sandy were back at the riverbank.

1613
02:56:49,840 --> 02:56:55,200
'I am not at my best in the water, so it 
is not a good plan for me to go down again  

1614
02:56:55,200 --> 02:56:57,760
and fight the Great King,' said Monkey.  

1615
02:56:58,720 --> 02:57:04,080
'I shall go to the Goddess of the Southern 
Ocean for help. I shall not waste a minute.'

1616
02:57:06,080 --> 02:57:13,040
Dear Monkey! He shot up in the air on a magic 
light, leapt on a cloud and found Kuan-yin.  

1617
02:57:14,000 --> 02:57:17,760
She was expecting him, but had 
not finished getting dressed.

1618
02:57:19,279 --> 02:57:25,279
'Let's leave now,' she said, when she saw 
Monkey. 'We will go and save Tripitaka.'

1619
02:57:26,720 --> 02:57:32,800
Monkey went down on his knees in front of her. 'Do 
you not want to finish dressing first?' he asked.

1620
02:57:33,680 --> 02:57:38,160
'It is too much trouble,' she 
answered. 'I am going like this.'

1621
02:57:40,000 --> 02:57:43,359
She left on her cloud, followed by Monkey.

1622
02:57:44,319 --> 02:57:50,880
'Well, that was quick!' said Pigsy, 
as they appeared. 'You did well to  

1623
02:57:50,880 --> 02:57:56,480
get a goddess to come immediately, before 
she had even finished combing her hair!'

1624
02:57:58,000 --> 02:58:01,600
The Goddess sailed low over 
the river like a cloud.  

1625
02:58:02,399 --> 02:58:09,040
Untying the belt from her dress, she tied a basket 
to it and pulled the basket through the water.  

1626
02:58:09,920 --> 02:58:19,200
She repeated the words, 'The dead go, the living 
stay,' seven times and pulled the basket up.  

1627
02:58:20,000 --> 02:58:25,760
There was a gold fish in it. Its 
tail moved and its eye stared.

1628
02:58:27,120 --> 02:58:32,960
'Go at once into the water and fetch 
your Master,' said the Goddess to Monkey.

1629
02:58:34,240 --> 02:58:37,519
'But what shall I do with the 
Great King?' asked Monkey.

1630
02:58:38,800 --> 02:58:45,680
'The Great King is in the basket,' said the 
Goddess. 'He used to live in a little pool  

1631
02:58:45,680 --> 02:58:54,160
in my garden. Every day he used to put his head 
out and listen to the Scriptures, until at last  

1632
02:58:54,160 --> 02:59:01,359
he held great magical powers. But one day 
there was a great storm and the water took  

1633
02:59:01,359 --> 02:59:08,719
him far out to sea. I thought that he might 
be using his magic against your Master.  

1634
02:59:09,439 --> 02:59:15,839
So without stopping to comb my hair, I 
made this magic basket to catch him in.'

1635
02:59:17,760 --> 02:59:23,920
'If you want to make humans believe in the 
Gods,' said Monkey, 'you will wait here. I  

1636
02:59:23,920 --> 02:59:28,880
will call the people of the village to hear 
this story and look at your golden face.'

1637
02:59:30,399 --> 02:59:33,839
So men and women, young and old,  

1638
02:59:33,840 --> 02:59:38,800
were soon hurrying to the river to go down 
on their knees in front of the Goddess.  

1639
02:59:39,600 --> 02:59:45,920
One of them later painted a famous painting 
called Kuan-yin with the Fish Basket.

1640
02:59:47,439 --> 02:59:53,200
When the Goddess had returned to the 
Southern Ocean, Pigsy and Sandy dived  

1641
02:59:53,200 --> 02:59:59,760
down to the Great King's palace. All the 
Great King's fish-followers were dead,  

1642
03:00:00,399 --> 03:00:06,080
so they soon helped Tripitaka out of the 
stone box and took him back to Ch'en's farm.

1643
03:00:07,520 --> 03:00:12,800
'We are sorry, Sirs,' said the Ch'en 
brothers, 'that you had so many problems.'

1644
03:00:13,760 --> 03:00:20,640
'Oh, that is all finished now,' said Monkey. 
'The important thing is that next year,  

1645
03:00:20,640 --> 03:00:25,120
and every other year, your village 
will not lose its children.  

1646
03:00:25,840 --> 03:00:30,160
But we would be glad if you could give 
us a boat to carry us across the river.'

1647
03:00:31,680 --> 03:00:37,840
All the villagers started to make boats. But 
when the pilgrims went back to the river,  

1648
03:00:37,840 --> 03:00:44,480
they heard a voice: 'Oh, great Monkey 
King, you do not need to build a boat.  

1649
03:00:45,120 --> 03:00:53,279
I will take you.' And above the waters they saw 
the white head and the enormous body of a turtle.

1650
03:00:55,200 --> 03:01:02,399
'You!' cried Monkey. 'You demon! If you come 
near us, I will kill you with my cudgel.'

1651
03:01:03,439 --> 03:01:06,479
'Great Monkey King,' said the turtle,

1652
03:01:07,120 --> 03:01:15,439
'listen to me. I am not a follower of the Great 
King. His palace below the river used to be mine.  

1653
03:01:15,439 --> 03:01:22,799
Then one day that creature came swimming into 
the river killed many of my family and made the  

1654
03:01:22,800 --> 03:01:31,600
others work for him. I am grateful for all that 
you have done - you have made us free again.'

1655
03:01:33,200 --> 03:01:38,559
'Promise me and promise the Gods 
that this is all true,' said Monkey.

1656
03:01:39,439 --> 03:01:47,040
The turtle opened his red mouth wide. 
'I promise you and all the Gods.

1657
03:01:47,040 --> 03:01:54,800
If I do not take Tripitaka safely across 
the river, my bones will turn to water.'

1658
03:01:56,399 --> 03:02:02,879
The turtle came out of the river, and people 
saw that his back was fifteen metres wide.

1659
03:02:04,800 --> 03:02:10,320
'Climb on the turtle's back,' called Monkey 
to the others. 'He has promised that we  

1660
03:02:10,319 --> 03:02:16,960
will be safe. When creatures speak human 
language, their words are usually true.'

1661
03:02:19,120 --> 03:02:25,920
The white horse was led to the middle of the 
turtle's back. Tripitaka stood to the left, Sandy  

1662
03:02:25,920 --> 03:02:33,359
to the right, and Pigsy behind the horse's tail. 
Monkey put himself in front of the horse's head.

1663
03:02:34,800 --> 03:02:44,000
'Now, turtle,' he cried. 'Go gently, because if 
you do not, there will be a cudgel on your head!'

1664
03:02:44,000 --> 03:02:48,080
With this warning, the turtle 
moved smoothly over the water.  

1665
03:02:49,200 --> 03:02:54,479
As the pilgrims left, all the people of 
the village bowed and thanked Buddha.

1666
03:02:55,600 --> 03:03:01,600
The turtle travelled quickly, and in less 
than a day they had arrived at the other side.

1667
03:03:03,120 --> 03:03:07,519
Tripitaka said to the turtle, 'I 
have nothing that I can give you.  

1668
03:03:08,160 --> 03:03:11,840
But I would like to thank you 
for taking us across the river.'

1669
03:03:12,960 --> 03:03:20,399
'Master,' replied the turtle, 'there is something 
that you could do for me. I have been trying to  

1670
03:03:20,399 --> 03:03:29,120
become perfect for about a thousand years, and 
that is a long time. I can now use human speech,  

1671
03:03:29,680 --> 03:03:36,640
but I am still a turtle. Please ask 
the Buddha if I can become a human.'

1672
03:03:38,640 --> 03:03:42,241
Tripitaka gladly promised 
to ask Buddha the question,  

1673
03:03:42,960 --> 03:03:45,920
and the turtle swam back to his home in the river.

1674
03:03:47,520 --> 03:03:53,840
Again Pigsy carried the luggage, and Monkey 
helped Tripitaka on to the white horse.  

1675
03:03:54,479 --> 03:03:58,319
With Sandy behind them, they 
soon found the road to the West.

1676
03:04:00,160 --> 03:04:05,680
They travelled for many months. The country was 
very different from anything they had seen before.  

1677
03:04:06,560 --> 03:04:10,560
The flowers were like jewels, 
the grass looked magical  

1678
03:04:11,120 --> 03:04:13,439
and there were strange and wonderful trees.

1679
03:04:15,520 --> 03:04:22,000
In every village, families were entertaining 
priests. On every hill, Immortals were  

1680
03:04:22,000 --> 03:04:28,720
practising control over their bodies. In every 
wood, pilgrims were reciting and singing.

1681
03:04:30,640 --> 03:04:38,161
Every night, they found somewhere to stay and left 
again at the first light of day. They travelled on  

1682
03:04:38,160 --> 03:04:46,639
in this way for many more days until suddenly the 
light grew bright and they saw a wonderful castle.

1683
03:04:47,760 --> 03:04:54,640
'Monkey,' said Tripitaka admiringly, 
pointing at it, 'that's a fine place!'

1684
03:04:56,319 --> 03:05:02,960
'Do you remember,' said Monkey, 'how often 
on our journey you have bowed in front of  

1685
03:05:02,960 --> 03:05:10,240
the caves and hiding-places and palaces 
of false magicians? It is strange that  

1686
03:05:10,240 --> 03:05:18,240
you do not even get off your horse now - 
when you see the Buddha's holy castle!'

1687
03:05:18,240 --> 03:05:21,040
So Tripitaka, in great excitement,  

1688
03:05:21,600 --> 03:05:28,161
jumped down from his horse. When they reached 
the gates, a young priest came out to greet them.

1689
03:05:29,279 --> 03:05:34,240
He asked, 'Are you the pilgrims who have 
come from the East for the Scriptures?'

1690
03:05:35,600 --> 03:05:41,360
The boy was dressed in beautiful clothes 
and carried a bowl of jade dust in his hand.  

1691
03:05:42,800 --> 03:05:45,840
Monkey knew him at once, and turned to Tripitaka.

1692
03:05:47,200 --> 03:05:54,880
'This,' he said, 'is the Golden-Headed Immortal of 
the Jade Temple at the foot of the Holy Mountain.'

1693
03:05:57,200 --> 03:06:01,200
'Here you are at last!' said 
the Golden-Headed Immortal.  

1694
03:06:02,080 --> 03:06:08,240
'It is now ten years since the Goddess 
Kuan-yin told me to expect your arrival.  

1695
03:06:09,040 --> 03:06:13,840
Year after year I have waited, 
but there has been no sign!'

1696
03:06:15,600 --> 03:06:22,241
'Great Immortal,' said Tripitaka, bowing low, 
'I cannot thank you enough for your patience.'

1697
03:06:23,920 --> 03:06:28,480
Inside the temple, sweet-smelling 
hot water was brought to wash in,  

1698
03:06:29,120 --> 03:06:32,640
and after supper the pilgrims 
were shown to their beds.

1699
03:06:34,240 --> 03:06:39,200
Early the next day, Tripitaka put 
on his finest clothes and jewellery  

1700
03:06:39,760 --> 03:06:41,840
and greeted the young Immortal.

1701
03:06:42,880 --> 03:06:49,920
'That is better,' said the young Immortal. 
'Yesterday you looked rather untidy,  

1702
03:06:50,640 --> 03:06:58,640
but today you look like a true child of Buddha! 
You must let me show you the way. Monkey knows it,  

1703
03:06:58,640 --> 03:07:02,720
but only by air, and you 
must travel on the ground.'

1704
03:07:04,319 --> 03:07:10,479
Taking Tripitaka by the hand, he led 
the pilgrims through the temple gardens  

1705
03:07:10,479 --> 03:07:14,639
to the back of the building and 
up a path to the hill behind.

1706
03:07:15,760 --> 03:07:18,080
'Do you see that mountain in front of you?'  

1707
03:07:18,800 --> 03:07:26,320
said the young Immortal, pointing up. 'That is 
where Buddha has his home. I shall now turn back.'

1708
03:07:27,680 --> 03:07:33,120
Tripitaka at once began bowing low, 
hitting his head on the holy ground.

1709
03:07:34,319 --> 03:07:38,000
'If you are going to do that 
all the way up,' said Monkey,  

1710
03:07:38,000 --> 03:07:41,840
'there will not be much of your 
head left by the time we get there!'

1711
03:07:43,279 --> 03:07:48,719
So Tripitaka stopped bowing and they 
climbed some way, walking easily.  

1712
03:07:50,000 --> 03:07:53,840
Then they came to a fast-moving 
river with rough water.

1713
03:07:54,960 --> 03:07:58,080
Tripitaka said, 'This cannot be the way.'  

1714
03:07:58,960 --> 03:08:07,439
But then he saw a bridge and a sign which said 
Cloud Reach Bridge. When they came to the bridge,  

1715
03:08:08,080 --> 03:08:15,120
they saw that it was just some trees laid end to 
end. It was only a little wider than a man's hand.

1716
03:08:16,160 --> 03:08:21,920
'Monkey!' cried Tripitaka, afraid. 
'I cannot walk across that!'

1717
03:08:23,120 --> 03:08:29,519
'Yes, yes, people walk across it to get 
to the Buddha. Wait while I show you how!'

1718
03:08:30,880 --> 03:08:34,400
Dear Monkey! He walked 
confidently up to the bridge,  

1719
03:08:34,960 --> 03:08:39,279
leapt lightly on to it and was 
soon waving from the other side.

1720
03:08:40,319 --> 03:08:42,799
'Follow me!' he shouted back.

1721
03:08:44,160 --> 03:08:52,880
But Pigsy and Sandy repeated to themselves, 'It 
cannot be done.' Tripitaka did not move at all.

1722
03:08:54,479 --> 03:08:58,479
Monkey leapt back again and 
started pulling at Pigsy.  

1723
03:08:59,359 --> 03:09:06,000
'Fool, follow me across!' But Pigsy lay 
flat on the ground and refused to move.

1724
03:09:07,600 --> 03:09:12,640
'If you do not come, how will you 
ever become a Buddha?' said Monkey.

1725
03:09:13,439 --> 03:09:20,160
'Buddha or no Buddha,' answered 
Pigsy, 'I will not go on that bridge!'

1726
03:09:21,760 --> 03:09:28,080
As they all started arguing, a boatman 
appeared with a boat. He was shouting,  

1727
03:09:28,080 --> 03:09:34,800
'Who wants to cross the river?' But when the 
boat came nearer, they saw that it had no bottom.

1728
03:09:37,200 --> 03:09:39,359
Monkey, with his sharp eyesight,  

1729
03:09:39,359 --> 03:09:45,120
had recognised the boatman as the Bringer 
of Souls, but he did not tell the others.

1730
03:09:46,560 --> 03:09:51,760
'How can you take people across a river 
in a bottomless boat?' asked Tripitaka.

1731
03:09:52,880 --> 03:09:58,720
'Many pilgrims ask me that,' he answered. 
'But since the beginning of time  

1732
03:09:58,720 --> 03:10:02,160
I have carried too many souls to count.'

1733
03:10:03,600 --> 03:10:06,720
'Get in the boat, Master,' said Monkey.  

1734
03:10:06,720 --> 03:10:11,840
'You will find that it will carry 
you quite easily and pleasantly.'

1735
03:10:11,840 --> 03:10:17,279
But Tripitaka still did not get in, 
so Monkey pushed him into the boat  

1736
03:10:17,279 --> 03:10:21,200
and Tripitaka immediately fell out into the water.  

1737
03:10:22,239 --> 03:10:29,519
The boatman caught him and pulled him in again. 
He sat there, unhappily squeezing the water  

1738
03:10:29,520 --> 03:10:35,280
out of his clothes and complaining to Monkey, 
who had more important things to think about.

1739
03:10:36,720 --> 03:10:42,640
Monkey put Pigsy, Sandy and the white horse 
on the side of the boat with Tripitaka.

1740
03:10:43,760 --> 03:10:48,960
The boat left and the boatman had 
taken them some way down the river  

1741
03:10:48,960 --> 03:10:53,840
when they saw a body in the water. 
Tripitaka looked very frightened.

1742
03:10:54,880 --> 03:11:00,400
Monkey laughed. 'Don't be frightened, 
Master,' he said. 'That is you.'

1743
03:11:01,439 --> 03:11:05,120
And Pigsy cried, 'It is you, it is you!'

1744
03:11:06,560 --> 03:11:14,000
The boatman said the same words to Tripitaka, 
adding, 'There you go! Congratulations!'

1745
03:11:15,600 --> 03:11:22,720
Safe on the other side of the river, Tripitaka 
stepped out of the boat. His earthly body was gone  

1746
03:11:22,720 --> 03:11:31,120
now, gone into the river, and all the foolishness 
of his early years was washed away. He now had the  

1747
03:11:31,120 --> 03:11:38,160
highest wisdom, the Wisdom of the Far Side of 
the River, and there is no end to that wisdom.

1748
03:11:40,399 --> 03:11:44,799
Before they could thank him, the 
boatman and his boat had disappeared,  

1749
03:11:45,439 --> 03:11:51,120
and now Monkey explained who 
the boatman was. Tripitaka began  

1750
03:11:51,120 --> 03:11:56,319
thanking his followers for all they had 
done for him, but Monkey interrupted.

1751
03:11:57,600 --> 03:12:03,360
'We should all give thanks to each other,' 
he said. 'This journey was too difficult  

1752
03:12:03,359 --> 03:12:09,599
for one man alone, and without all of us 
the Master could not lose his human body.'

1753
03:12:11,279 --> 03:12:14,719
With a strange feeling of 
lightness and great happiness,  

1754
03:12:15,279 --> 03:12:22,479
they went up the Holy Mountain. Near the 
top, Immortals greeted the pilgrims and  

1755
03:12:22,479 --> 03:12:28,879
then they were met by the Keeper of 
Metal, Wood, Water, Fire and Earth.

1756
03:12:30,399 --> 03:12:34,879
'So you are here at last, 
Great Priest,' he smiled.

1757
03:12:36,080 --> 03:12:42,960
'Your follower Hsuan Tsang, the priest Tripitaka, 
has finally arrived,' said Tripitaka, bowing.

1758
03:12:43,920 --> 03:12:52,000
The Great Buddha was very pleased at the news 
and ordered all the Gods to come to him. Then  

1759
03:12:52,000 --> 03:12:59,840
his command was shouted for everyone to hear: 
'The priest of Tsang must be brought in.'

1760
03:13:01,200 --> 03:13:10,000
Tripitaka, Monkey, Pigsy and Sandy all went in, 
followed by the white horse and the luggage. In  

1761
03:13:10,000 --> 03:13:16,720
the Great Hall they first lay flat in front of 
Buddha, then bowed to the right and to the left.

1762
03:13:18,160 --> 03:13:25,760
Then Tripitaka said, 'The follower of Buddha, 
Hsuan Tsang, has come by order of the Emperor  

1763
03:13:25,760 --> 03:13:31,840
of the great land of T'ang to fetch 
the True Scriptures. They will save  

1764
03:13:31,840 --> 03:13:37,200
all the people of the world. I ask 
the Great Buddha for these Scriptures  

1765
03:13:37,760 --> 03:13:41,840
and also to allow me a quick 
return to my own country.'

1766
03:13:43,520 --> 03:13:46,640
Then the Great Buddha said these words:  

1767
03:13:47,920 --> 03:13:57,200
'In all your great Eastern Land there is killing 
and lying; there are bad thoughts and bad actions.  

1768
03:13:58,000 --> 03:14:05,680
But I have three baskets of Scriptures that 
can save the people. One contains the Law,  

1769
03:14:06,319 --> 03:14:15,599
which tells of Heaven. One contains the 
Lessons, which tell of Earth. One contains  

1770
03:14:15,600 --> 03:14:23,680
the Scriptures, which save the Dead. They 
are written in fifteen thousand one hundred  

1771
03:14:23,680 --> 03:14:32,240
and forty-four books. They are the Path to 
Perfection, the gate that leads to True Good.  

1772
03:14:33,200 --> 03:14:46,479
In them you can learn everything about men, birds, 
animals, flowers, trees, stars and Earth. I would  

1773
03:14:46,479 --> 03:14:55,120
like to give them all to you. But the people 
of China are too foolish to understand them. So  

1774
03:14:55,920 --> 03:15:02,640
a few books from each basket will be given 
to these priests to take back to the East.'

1775
03:15:04,720 --> 03:15:09,760
The pilgrims were taken to a lower room 
and shown the books from each basket.  

1776
03:15:10,880 --> 03:15:17,120
Then they were given food of a beauty and 
taste that was unknown on Earth. When they  

1777
03:15:17,120 --> 03:15:23,040
had finished eating, two followers of Buddha 
took them to a special room down some stairs.  

1778
03:15:24,479 --> 03:15:32,479
The door was opened and a magic light filled the 
room. On the many beautiful jewelled boxes were  

1779
03:15:32,479 --> 03:15:39,679
written the names of the holy books. The two 
followers of Buddha led Tripitaka to the place  

1780
03:15:39,680 --> 03:15:47,201
where the Scriptures lay. After inviting him to 
study the titles, they asked Tripitaka to show  

1781
03:15:47,200 --> 03:15:54,319
them the gifts he had brought for them. They 
planned to give him the Scriptures in return.

1782
03:15:55,760 --> 03:15:59,600
'I have brought nothing at 
all for you,' said Tripitaka.  

1783
03:16:00,319 --> 03:16:08,319
'On my journey I have sometimes received gifts, 
but nobody has ever asked for gifts in return.'

1784
03:16:09,439 --> 03:16:12,960
And Monkey, hearing these words, shouted angrily,  

1785
03:16:13,600 --> 03:16:17,680
'Come with me, Master! We will 
see what Buddha says about this!'

1786
03:16:19,840 --> 03:16:23,920
One of the two followers said 
quickly, 'There is no need to shout.  

1787
03:16:24,560 --> 03:16:26,880
Come here and fetch your Scriptures.'

1788
03:16:28,080 --> 03:16:32,960
The pilgrims hid their anger, put 
the Scriptures on the horse's back  

1789
03:16:32,960 --> 03:16:38,160
and bowed to Buddha's followers. 
Then they left, down the mountain.

1790
03:16:39,279 --> 03:16:45,279
The Buddha of the Past was sitting in an 
upper room and had heard everything the two  

1791
03:16:45,279 --> 03:16:52,479
followers had said. He was sure they had given the 
pilgrims Scriptures with nothing written on them  

1792
03:16:52,479 --> 03:16:59,359
because they had received no gifts. So he sent a 
messenger after the pilgrims and, of course, the  

1793
03:16:59,359 --> 03:17:06,479
Buddha of the Past was correct. When the pilgrims 
opened the Scriptures, they saw only white pages.

1794
03:17:07,520 --> 03:17:12,960
Tripitaka cried, 'How can I go back 
to the Emperor of T'ang with these?  

1795
03:17:13,520 --> 03:17:17,520
He will think I am laughing at 
him. He will order my death.'

1796
03:17:19,520 --> 03:17:25,920
'I know the reason for this. Those two 
followers did not get any gifts, so you did  

1797
03:17:25,920 --> 03:17:33,200
not get any Scriptures! We will have to go back 
to Buddha,' said Monkey. They went back at once.

1798
03:17:34,800 --> 03:17:38,160
'Listen to this!' shouted Monkey to Buddha.  

1799
03:17:38,160 --> 03:17:43,599
'They have given us white pages with no words 
on them because we did not bring them gifts.'

1800
03:17:44,880 --> 03:17:48,319
'You need not shout,' said Buddha, smiling.  

1801
03:17:49,040 --> 03:17:54,560
'I have sometimes thought that perhaps 
it should not be too easy to get the  

1802
03:17:54,560 --> 03:18:01,840
Scriptures. My two followers expected a 
gift because of a bad experience they had.  

1803
03:18:02,800 --> 03:18:10,800
Not long ago, I gave them permission to go down 
the mountain with some Scriptures. After letting  

1804
03:18:10,800 --> 03:18:18,480
Chao read a few Scriptures to his people, my 
followers were given only some rice in return.  

1805
03:18:19,600 --> 03:18:25,920
The result of hearing these Scriptures was that 
his people were protected from all their enemies.  

1806
03:18:26,960 --> 03:18:33,680
Afterwards I told my two followers that 
they had sold the Scriptures too cheaply.  

1807
03:18:34,720 --> 03:18:42,960
So, you see, they are not to blame. In fact, 
these white pages are the True Scriptures.  

1808
03:18:43,760 --> 03:18:50,640
But the people of China are not very clever, 
so they cannot understand such things.  

1809
03:18:51,600 --> 03:18:55,600
You had better have some 
scriptures with writing on them.'

1810
03:18:57,680 --> 03:19:03,120
This time Tripitaka offered the two 
Buddhist followers the only gift he  

1811
03:19:03,120 --> 03:19:10,239
could think of - his golden bowl. He had 
received this bowl from the Emperor of China,  

1812
03:19:10,239 --> 03:19:14,719
who told him to use it for collecting 
money from kind people on his journey.  

1813
03:19:16,160 --> 03:19:22,960
The followers accepted the gift, but many of the 
Gods laughed because it was such a small present.

1814
03:19:26,319 --> 03:19:33,359
As they started to leave again, the Goddess 
Kuan-yin appeared in front of Buddha. 'I  

1815
03:19:33,359 --> 03:19:41,120
found this man for you and he has now fetched the 
Scriptures. It took him five thousand and forty  

1816
03:19:41,120 --> 03:19:49,599
days. The number of chapters in the Scriptures 
is five thousand and forty-eight. Please allow  

1817
03:19:49,600 --> 03:19:56,000
him to make the return journey in eight 
days. Then the numbers will be the same.'

1818
03:19:57,200 --> 03:20:02,639
'That is a good idea,' said Buddha. 
'I will make sure that it is done.'

1819
03:20:04,720 --> 03:20:11,680
Buddha then sent for eight of his messengers 
and said to them, 'Use your magic powers  

1820
03:20:12,319 --> 03:20:19,519
and carry Tripitaka back to the East. When he 
has left the Scriptures, bring him back here.  

1821
03:20:20,399 --> 03:20:23,519
All of this must be done in eight days.

1822
03:20:25,279 --> 03:20:32,559
Buddha's messengers went immediately to put 
Tripitaka and the pilgrims on a magic cloud. And  

1823
03:20:32,560 --> 03:20:41,840
as the pilgrims flew away, they had little idea 
of what was going to happen next.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

1824
03:20:42,960 --> 03:20:43,840
CHAPTER SIX

1825
03:20:44,640 --> 03:20:46,080
The End of the Journey

1826
03:20:47,200 --> 03:20:55,840
'Hey!' said Pigsy. 'You have just made the 
others Buddhas. Why am I not a Buddha too?'

1827
03:20:58,000 --> 03:21:03,920
Many Protectors had watched over Tripitaka 
and his followers on their frightening but  

1828
03:21:03,920 --> 03:21:09,760
wonderful journey to the West. Now 
the Protectors appeared to Kuan-yin.

1829
03:21:11,279 --> 03:21:14,319
'We wish to report that we 
have followed your holy orders.  

1830
03:21:14,880 --> 03:21:21,279
And, without his knowledge, we have protected the 
young Priest of T'ang on his journey to the West.'

1831
03:21:22,800 --> 03:21:28,880
'I would like to know,' said the Goddess, 
'how the pilgrims behaved on their journey.'

1832
03:21:30,000 --> 03:21:35,439
'They were brave, they never gave up, and they 
never forgot the importance of their work.  

1833
03:21:36,399 --> 03:21:40,319
They had many problems along 
the way - too many to tell.  

1834
03:21:41,279 --> 03:21:44,160
But we have a record of 
the most difficult fights.'

1835
03:21:45,600 --> 03:21:50,880
The Protectors then read to the Goddess 
Kuan-yin a list of all the fights that the  

1836
03:21:50,880 --> 03:21:57,840
pilgrims had fought. They had fought on their 
journey against animals, humans and spirits.

1837
03:21:59,359 --> 03:22:02,160
Kuan-yin read the list slowly and carefully:  

1838
03:22:03,279 --> 03:22:10,800
'Tripitaka falls into a hole and is attacked by 
a tiger, but is saved by his follower Monkey...'  

1839
03:22:12,160 --> 03:22:17,760
She finished with Tripitaka losing his human 
body when he stepped into the bottomless boat.

1840
03:22:19,680 --> 03:22:24,320
'In our religion, nine times 
nine is a very important number.  

1841
03:22:25,359 --> 03:22:31,599
You have listed eighty fights,' said the 
Goddess. 'That is one short of the holy  

1842
03:22:31,600 --> 03:22:38,400
number of eighty-one. There has to be 
one more fight, so please arrange it.'

1843
03:22:40,800 --> 03:22:45,760
When the Goddess had spoken, the Protectors 
immediately stopped the magic wind that  

1844
03:22:45,760 --> 03:22:51,840
was carrying the pilgrims through space. 
Suddenly, and without any warning, the horse,  

1845
03:22:51,840 --> 03:22:58,160
the Scriptures, the Master, Monkey, 
Sandy and Pigsy all fell down to Earth.

1846
03:22:59,760 --> 03:23:03,120
Tripitaka looked very surprised to find himself  

1847
03:23:03,120 --> 03:23:06,160
standing on the ground instead 
of flying through the air.

1848
03:23:07,439 --> 03:23:16,719
Pigsy laughed and laughed. 'Well, you never know 
what is going to happen next, do you?' he said.  

1849
03:23:16,720 --> 03:23:25,040
'One minute we are rushing at great speed; the 
next minute we have both feet on the ground.'

1850
03:23:26,239 --> 03:23:30,000
Sandy said, 'I think that 
it was very thoughtful of  

1851
03:23:30,000 --> 03:23:33,120
them. They probably thought we would like a rest.'

1852
03:23:34,399 --> 03:23:39,359
'Well,' said Monkey, 'if you 
sit without moving for ten days,  

1853
03:23:39,359 --> 03:23:43,839
then surely you will speed down 
nine waterfalls in one day.'

1854
03:23:45,439 --> 03:23:51,439
'That is enough rubbish!' said Tripitaka. 
'Will you please try to find out where we are.'

1855
03:23:52,479 --> 03:23:59,040
'I know, I know,' said Sandy, looking 
around. 'Listen to that sound of water.'

1856
03:24:00,239 --> 03:24:03,120
'It makes Sandy feel at home,' said Monkey.

1857
03:24:04,080 --> 03:24:08,960
'It must be...' Pigsy started to 
say, but Sandy interrupted him.

1858
03:24:09,680 --> 03:24:17,040
'It is the River That Leads to Heaven and 
this is the western riverbank,' Sandy said.

1859
03:24:18,319 --> 03:24:25,519
'I recognise it now,' said Tripitaka. 
'On the other side is Mr Ch'en's farm,  

1860
03:24:25,520 --> 03:24:30,880
where you saved the boy and the girl from 
the Great King. They were very grateful  

1861
03:24:30,880 --> 03:24:36,880
to us and wanted to build a boat for us. 
In the end, the turtle carried us across.  

1862
03:24:37,920 --> 03:24:44,880
I remember that on this side there are no houses 
at all. How are we going to manage this time?'

1863
03:24:46,000 --> 03:24:55,200
'A trick like this from humans is to be expected,' 
said Pigsy. 'But not from Buddha's own followers.  

1864
03:24:55,920 --> 03:25:02,080
Buddha told them to take us straight back 
to China. What do they mean by dropping  

1865
03:25:02,080 --> 03:25:07,840
us in the middle of the journey? They 
have left us in a difficult situation.'

1866
03:25:08,960 --> 03:25:15,359
'I do not know what you two are complaining 
about,' said Sandy. 'The Master is not a common  

1867
03:25:15,359 --> 03:25:22,639
mortal now. We saw his earthly body go past us 
down the Cloud River. He will not sink into the  

1868
03:25:22,640 --> 03:25:28,880
water this time. With all three of us to help 
him, he will surely be able to get across.'

1869
03:25:30,560 --> 03:25:35,840
Monkey smiled to himself. 'It is not 
going to be as easy as that,' he said.

1870
03:25:37,120 --> 03:25:42,559
Why did Monkey say that it was not going 
to be easy? They had enough magic power to  

1871
03:25:42,560 --> 03:25:49,840
cross a thousand rivers! But Monkey knew that the 
number 'nine times nine' had not yet been reached.  

1872
03:25:50,800 --> 03:25:53,840
He knew that Buddha expected one more fight.

1873
03:25:55,840 --> 03:25:59,120
They walked along slowly, wondering what to do.  

1874
03:26:00,239 --> 03:26:07,279
Suddenly, they heard a voice saying, 'Priest 
of T'ang, Priest of T'ang, come over here.'

1875
03:26:08,399 --> 03:26:11,759
As there was nobody on land 
and no boat on the river,  

1876
03:26:11,760 --> 03:26:17,840
they were very surprised. But suddenly a 
large white head appeared in the water.

1877
03:26:18,800 --> 03:26:24,880
'Well,' called the turtle, 'I have 
been waiting for you all this time.'

1878
03:26:26,080 --> 03:26:30,319
'We are very glad to meet you,' 
said Monkey. 'Come a little closer.'

1879
03:26:31,520 --> 03:26:38,400
Once again, the turtle came out of the river. 
Monkey led the white horse and then the pilgrims,  

1880
03:26:38,399 --> 03:26:45,839
carrying their luggage, on to its back. Pigsy sat 
behind its tail, Tripitaka stood on one side of  

1881
03:26:45,840 --> 03:26:52,319
its head and Sandy on the other. Monkey stood with 
one foot on its neck and the other on its head.

1882
03:26:53,600 --> 03:26:57,920
Monkey cried, 'Time to go, Old Turtle! Go gently!'  

1883
03:26:58,720 --> 03:27:04,240
And the turtle swam easily through 
the endless waters until evening came.

1884
03:27:06,000 --> 03:27:11,040
But when they were nearly at the far side, 
the turtle suddenly asked Tripitaka an  

1885
03:27:11,040 --> 03:27:18,640
important question. 'When I took you across 
last time, I asked you to find out from  

1886
03:27:18,640 --> 03:27:27,840
Buddha how long I have to wait before I become 
a human. Did you remember to ask Buddha?'

1887
03:27:28,560 --> 03:27:35,520
Unfortunately, Tripitaka had been so busy with 
his own problems - losing his mortal body,  

1888
03:27:35,520 --> 03:27:39,280
going up the mountain, meeting 
Buddha and all his followers,  

1889
03:27:39,920 --> 03:27:44,800
taking the Scriptures - that he had 
had no time to think of anything else.

1890
03:27:45,840 --> 03:27:50,640
Tripitaka did not want to tell a 
lie but he did not know what to say.

1891
03:27:52,160 --> 03:27:56,319
When no answer came, the turtle 
knew that he had not asked.  

1892
03:27:57,359 --> 03:28:04,719
It was very annoyed. The turtle did not think it 
had asked for much. And it was true, it had not.

1893
03:28:05,680 --> 03:28:14,480
'You have broken your promise!' said the 
turtle. Without another word, it dived deep  

1894
03:28:14,479 --> 03:28:21,359
down into the water, leaving the four pilgrims, 
the horse and the holy Scriptures in the river.

1895
03:28:23,200 --> 03:28:30,720
But there was some good fortune in their 
misfortune. First, Tripitaka was now immortal  

1896
03:28:30,720 --> 03:28:38,160
and could not die under water. Second, the 
white horse was really a dragon and could swim  

1897
03:28:38,160 --> 03:28:44,559
very well. Third, Pigsy and Sandy were 
both perfectly happy in the water.  

1898
03:28:45,600 --> 03:28:50,480
Monkey, of course, just leapt into the air 
and helped his Master back to the land.

1899
03:28:51,600 --> 03:28:57,920
But the Scriptures and all the luggage were wet, 
and as they climbed to the riverbank a great wind  

1900
03:28:57,920 --> 03:29:04,640
began to blow. The sky grew black and 
lightning lit up the sky. Tripitaka  

1901
03:29:04,640 --> 03:29:10,640
held the Scriptures close to him while Sandy 
held the luggage and Pigsy held the white horse.

1902
03:29:11,920 --> 03:29:16,640
Monkey knew that this storm was caused 
by demons who were trying to steal the  

1903
03:29:16,640 --> 03:29:23,040
Scriptures. The demons attacked all through the 
night, stopping only when the sun began to come  

1904
03:29:23,040 --> 03:29:28,399
up. And although nobody could see them, 
Monkey hit out with his cudgel at them,  

1905
03:29:28,399 --> 03:29:33,839
holding it in both hands and hitting 
first to the right and then to the left.

1906
03:29:35,520 --> 03:29:40,720
Tripitaka, who was already wet from 
the storm, was left shaking with fear.

1907
03:29:41,760 --> 03:29:48,160
'Monkey,' he asked in a shocked 
voice, 'what does all this mean?'

1908
03:29:48,160 --> 03:29:55,279
'It is jealousy,' answered Monkey. 'The success of 
our journey has put jealousy in the heart of every  

1909
03:29:55,279 --> 03:30:03,120
demon in Heaven and on Earth, because our power 
is almost as great as theirs now. It is good that  

1910
03:30:03,120 --> 03:30:10,319
you kept the Scriptures close to you. That and 
my cudgel saved us from losing the holy words.'

1911
03:30:11,680 --> 03:30:15,840
Tripitaka then understood and he 
thanked Monkey for his protection.

1912
03:30:17,120 --> 03:30:25,439
When the sun was hotter, they dried their clothes 
and the Scriptures on a rock. Even today this rock  

1913
03:30:25,439 --> 03:30:32,239
is called The Rock Where the Scriptures Were 
Dried. They also dried their shoes and clothes.

1914
03:30:33,760 --> 03:30:37,280
When they had almost finished, 
some workers came past.  

1915
03:30:38,560 --> 03:30:44,720
They said, 'Are you not the gentlemen who crossed 
the river to fetch the Scriptures from India?'

1916
03:30:45,760 --> 03:30:50,720
'That is right,' said Pigsy. 
'How do you recognise us?'

1917
03:30:52,160 --> 03:30:54,960
'We are from Mr Ch'en's farm,' they answered.

1918
03:30:55,680 --> 03:30:59,040
'How far is it from here?' Pigsy asked.

1919
03:30:59,840 --> 03:31:06,080
'If you went about twenty kilometres south from 
here, you would come to it,' they answered.

1920
03:31:07,279 --> 03:31:11,599
'Let's take the Scriptures 
and dry them at the farm,'  

1921
03:31:11,600 --> 03:31:18,320
said Pigsy. 'If we go there, we can sit 
down comfortably and get something to eat.'

1922
03:31:19,600 --> 03:31:26,161
'I am not going,' said Tripitaka. 'We 
can dry the scriptures very well here.'

1923
03:31:26,160 --> 03:31:28,880
But then Mr Ch'en himself appeared.  

1924
03:31:29,920 --> 03:31:35,920
'I see that you have got the Scriptures,' 
he said happily. 'Please come home with me!'

1925
03:31:37,120 --> 03:31:42,080
'Wait until our Scriptures are dry,' said 
Monkey. 'Then we will go home with you.'

1926
03:31:42,960 --> 03:31:49,279
'I see that your clothes are wet too. 
What has happened to you?' asked Mr Ch'en.

1927
03:31:50,640 --> 03:31:55,520
Tripitaka explained about the 
white turtle. When he finished,  

1928
03:31:55,520 --> 03:32:02,720
Mr Ch'en again asked them to follow him home. 
In the end, Tripitaka accepted the kind offer.  

1929
03:32:03,760 --> 03:32:08,000
But when they were collecting the 
Scriptures, some of the paper stuck  

1930
03:32:08,000 --> 03:32:15,760
to the rock, and part of the last sheet of paper 
was lost. That is why it is incomplete today.  

1931
03:32:16,640 --> 03:32:22,640
And still today you can find some writing 
on the Rock Where the Scriptures Were Dried.

1932
03:32:24,560 --> 03:32:30,480
Tripitaka was very upset. 'We were 
not careful enough,' he said sadly.

1933
03:32:31,520 --> 03:32:38,960
'Don't get yourself so upset,' said Monkey. 'These 
Scriptures are now as they are supposed to be.  

1934
03:32:39,760 --> 03:32:46,080
Heaven and Earth are not more complete. The 
missing part is a secret and it is not meant  

1935
03:32:46,080 --> 03:32:52,399
to be read by others. You were as careful 
as you needed to be. You did nothing wrong.'

1936
03:32:54,160 --> 03:33:02,000
Back at the farm, they were welcomed by everybody 
there, young and old, and given all the best wine  

1937
03:33:02,000 --> 03:33:10,319
and food. As a Buddha, though, Tripitaka had 
lost his taste for earthly food, and Monkey  

1938
03:33:10,319 --> 03:33:18,319
wanted only fruit. Sandy ate very little, 
and even Pigsy ate less than he had before.

1939
03:33:18,319 --> 03:33:23,599
'I do not know why I cannot 
eat more,' he said sadly.

1940
03:33:25,760 --> 03:33:34,080
After they had eaten, Mr Ch'en said, 'We have had 
some pictures painted of you. We wanted to thank  

1941
03:33:34,080 --> 03:33:42,239
you for saving War Boy and Much Gold.' Then War 
Boy and Much Gold came into the room and bowed.  

1942
03:33:42,880 --> 03:33:48,560
The pilgrims were invited to look at pictures 
of themselves in the upstairs room of the farm.

1943
03:33:49,600 --> 03:33:56,800
'Yours is very like you,' said Pigsy, 
pushing his elbow gently into Monkey's side.

1944
03:33:57,439 --> 03:34:00,960
'I think yours is wonderfully like you too,'  

1945
03:34:00,960 --> 03:34:07,439
said Sandy to Pigsy. 'But the Master's 
painting is a little too handsome, really.'

1946
03:34:08,720 --> 03:34:11,920
'I think it is very good,' said Tripitaka.

1947
03:34:13,040 --> 03:34:17,680
The brothers Ch'en and all their workers 
prayed to these pictures every day.

1948
03:34:18,399 --> 03:34:22,879
Since their prayers had started, there 
had been no more damage from rain  

1949
03:34:22,880 --> 03:34:25,120
and everybody had had plenty to eat.

1950
03:34:26,479 --> 03:34:33,120
'That is a gift from Heaven, not from us,' said 
Monkey. 'But we will certainly try to protect you.  

1951
03:34:33,920 --> 03:34:38,160
You will have many children and those 
children will have many children.  

1952
03:34:38,800 --> 03:34:44,640
Your animals will grow fat, and the wind and 
the rain will come at the right time of year.'

1953
03:34:45,840 --> 03:34:50,960
The people thanked him again. And 
again they offered more fruit and cake.

1954
03:34:51,920 --> 03:35:01,040
'It is my bad luck,' said Pigsy. 'I used 
to be able to eat a lot, but in those days  

1955
03:35:01,040 --> 03:35:09,840
no one pushed food on me. Now I eat very 
little and everybody wants to see me eat more!'  

1956
03:35:11,200 --> 03:35:14,639
Because he did not want to 
insult the Ch'en family,  

1957
03:35:14,640 --> 03:35:20,960
Pigsy managed to eat eight or nine dishes 
of vegetables and twenty or thirty cakes.

1958
03:35:22,560 --> 03:35:30,640
It was now late at night. Tripitaka watched the 
Scriptures but he felt nervous. 'I think we should  

1959
03:35:30,640 --> 03:35:37,840
leave,' he told Monkey. 'If we stay here too 
long, people will try to get our secrets from us.'

1960
03:35:38,640 --> 03:35:44,161
'I agree with you,' said Monkey. 'We had better 
go quietly while everyone is still asleep.'

1961
03:35:45,920 --> 03:35:53,440
Pigsy was not a fool now. Sandy and the horse 
clearly saw the need to go too. And as the  

1962
03:35:53,439 --> 03:35:59,599
pilgrims left the farm, a sweet-smelling 
wind took them up and away on a cloud.

1963
03:36:00,960 --> 03:36:06,239
In the morning, the villagers came again 
with offers of fruit and other special food.  

1964
03:36:07,279 --> 03:36:12,000
It was a terrible surprise when they 
found that the pilgrims had disappeared.  

1965
03:36:12,800 --> 03:36:18,160
They looked everywhere for them, but 
after a few hours they gave up hope.

1966
03:36:19,359 --> 03:36:26,319
'Why have you taken our living Buddha away?' 
they cried to the God of Continuing Days.

1967
03:36:28,399 --> 03:36:34,160
Since that time, four times a year, the 
villagers have performed a special dance  

1968
03:36:34,160 --> 03:36:40,960
in front of the pictures of the Master and his 
followers. The farm has been turned into a temple  

1969
03:36:41,520 --> 03:36:48,400
and at every hour of every day there are people 
praying on their knees there. Some pray for better  

1970
03:36:48,399 --> 03:36:54,639
health, some pray for protection on a journey 
and others pray for their children's future.

1971
03:36:56,160 --> 03:37:02,960
Less than a day after they left Ch'en's farm, the 
pilgrims could see in the distance the towers of  

1972
03:37:02,960 --> 03:37:09,359
Ch'ang-an. It was thirteen years and 
nine months since Tripitaka had departed.

1973
03:37:10,479 --> 03:37:15,679
The Emperor had ordered a high tower 
to be built outside the western gates  

1974
03:37:15,680 --> 03:37:23,600
and had named it the Scripture Lookout Tower. 
And now, looking out, he suddenly saw the whole  

1975
03:37:23,600 --> 03:37:31,121
western sky fill with a magic light. A minute 
later, he noticed a sweet smell in the wind.

1976
03:37:32,000 --> 03:37:36,080
The Protectors went with the pilgrims 
as far as the gates of the city.

1977
03:37:37,520 --> 03:37:44,240
'We prefer to wait here for you,' they said 
to Tripitaka. 'The people around here are very  

1978
03:37:44,239 --> 03:37:50,319
tricky. We do not want them to know that we are 
here. And there is no need for your followers  

1979
03:37:50,319 --> 03:37:58,239
to go with you. But you, Master, had better go 
at once and give the Emperor the Scriptures.  

1980
03:37:58,239 --> 03:38:04,399
We will wait for you here and then we will all 
go back and report to Buddha's Holy Mountain.'

1981
03:38:06,000 --> 03:38:10,880
'That sounds fine,' said Monkey. 'But 
how can the Master carry the Scriptures  

1982
03:38:11,439 --> 03:38:15,279
and who is going to lead his 
horse? We had better go with him.'

1983
03:38:16,800 --> 03:38:23,760
'Kuan-yin promised Buddha that the whole journey 
would take only eight days. If you all go,  

1984
03:38:24,319 --> 03:38:30,000
Pigsy will be looking around for food, and you 
will lose time,' said one of the Protectors.

1985
03:38:30,720 --> 03:38:37,600
'How can you be so rude?' cried 
Pigsy. 'Why should I waste time here?  

1986
03:38:38,160 --> 03:38:42,960
I am as anxious as anyone to get 
back to Buddha's Holy Mountain.  

1987
03:38:43,520 --> 03:38:51,760
The Master has become a Buddha and I intend 
to become a Buddha too. You wait here. When  

1988
03:38:51,760 --> 03:38:58,640
we have given the Emperor the Scriptures, I 
will go back with you and will get my reward.'

1989
03:39:00,560 --> 03:39:07,680
Then, with Pigsy carrying the luggage, Sandy 
leading the horse and Monkey at Tripitaka's side,  

1990
03:39:07,680 --> 03:39:09,760
they stopped in front of the tower.

1991
03:39:10,800 --> 03:39:14,400
The Emperor and his ministers 
came down to meet them.

1992
03:39:15,520 --> 03:39:24,560
'So my dear brother has come at last!' the Emperor 
cried, giving him a horse to ride into the city.

1993
03:39:25,920 --> 03:39:30,880
When they were seated in the Great Hall, the 
Scriptures were put in front of the Emperor.  

1994
03:39:31,840 --> 03:39:36,160
Tripitaka told the story of how 
he arrived at the Holy Mountain.  

1995
03:39:37,199 --> 03:39:42,559
He told of the trick played by Buddha's 
two followers. He described how he had,  

1996
03:39:42,560 --> 03:39:48,000
in the end, got the written Scriptures 
by giving his golden bowl as a gift.

1997
03:39:49,120 --> 03:39:53,920
'There are, in total, five thousand 
and forty-eight chapters,' he added.

1998
03:39:54,640 --> 03:40:02,800
The Emperor was very happy and he ordered a 
banquet. Suddenly, he noticed the three pilgrims,  

1999
03:40:02,800 --> 03:40:07,680
who were sitting at the far end of the 
Hall. He thought they looked unusual.

2000
03:40:09,120 --> 03:40:13,920
'I suppose these gentlemen are 
foreigners?' said the Emperor.

2001
03:40:15,359 --> 03:40:19,839
'My oldest follower, named 
Monkey,' said Tripitaka,  

2002
03:40:19,840 --> 03:40:24,239
'came from the Cave of the Water Curtain 
on the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit.  

2003
03:40:25,040 --> 03:40:30,560
Five hundred years ago he made trouble 
in Heaven and Buddha sent him to a stone  

2004
03:40:30,560 --> 03:40:37,200
prison under a mountain. But he became a holy 
man with the help of the Goddess Kuan-yin.

2005
03:40:38,160 --> 03:40:44,239
I was able to free him and take him with 
me as my follower. He protected me on the  

2006
03:40:44,239 --> 03:40:51,279
journey to India and he helped me to get the 
Scriptures. Without him, I would not be here now.

2007
03:40:52,720 --> 03:40:58,160
'My second follower, Pigsy, 
came from the Cloud-Ladder Cave  

2008
03:40:58,160 --> 03:41:06,080
and was at the farm of Mr Kao when I found him. 
He has carried the luggage all through our travels  

2009
03:41:06,080 --> 03:41:09,600
and he was very helpful when 
we had to get across rivers.

2010
03:41:11,120 --> 03:41:15,680
'My third follower, Sandy, 
came from the River of Sands.  

2011
03:41:16,319 --> 03:41:24,239
He too was brought to me by the Goddess Kuan-yin. 
And our horse is not the one that you gave to me.'

2012
03:41:25,120 --> 03:41:31,439
'Really?' said the Emperor. 'It looks the 
same to me. Why did you change horses?'

2013
03:41:32,560 --> 03:41:41,200
'Actually,' said Tripitaka, 'my first horse was 
eaten by this one. But Monkey went to Kuan-yin and  

2014
03:41:41,199 --> 03:41:47,439
the Goddess explained that this horse was really 
a son of the Dragon King of the Western Ocean.  

2015
03:41:48,080 --> 03:41:56,080
He got into some trouble, but he took me to the 
West and so his life was saved. He has carried me  

2016
03:41:56,080 --> 03:42:03,359
well, over the most difficult hills and 
mountains. On the way there, I rode on its back;  

2017
03:42:04,080 --> 03:42:11,600
on the way home, it carried the Scriptures. As 
you can imagine, we are all very grateful to him.'

2018
03:42:12,880 --> 03:42:21,120
'You have been served well. Tell me,' said 
the Emperor, 'how far is it to India?'

2019
03:42:22,319 --> 03:42:26,000
'I know only that the summer 
turned to winter fourteen times.  

2020
03:42:26,720 --> 03:42:32,880
There was no day when we did not ride over 
hills or mountains. Often we rode through  

2021
03:42:32,880 --> 03:42:39,359
large forests or crossed great rivers and we 
passed through too many countries to count.'

2022
03:42:41,840 --> 03:42:44,720
When the banquet was ready, the Emperor asked,  

2023
03:42:45,439 --> 03:42:50,199
'Do your followers know how to 
behave at an Emperor's banquet?'

2024
03:42:50,199 --> 03:42:57,040
'I am afraid that they do not,' said 
Tripitaka. 'They have spent their time  

2025
03:42:57,040 --> 03:42:59,519
mostly in rough country conditions.'

2026
03:43:00,399 --> 03:43:07,439
'Don't worry,' said the Emperor. 'I will not 
blame them. Tell them to come to the banquet.'

2027
03:43:09,279 --> 03:43:16,000
There was dancing and singing and music and food 
at the banquet, and it was a very happy day.  

2028
03:43:16,960 --> 03:43:23,359
In the evening, when the meal ended, the pilgrims 
went to Tripitaka's old temple in the woods.  

2029
03:43:24,239 --> 03:43:27,599
There the priests welcomed them with a bow.

2030
03:43:28,800 --> 03:43:33,840
This time, inside the temple, 
Pigsy did not shout for more food  

2031
03:43:34,399 --> 03:43:41,920
and Monkey and Sandy behaved perfectly. 
All three were now Spirits of Wisdom,  

2032
03:43:42,479 --> 03:43:48,799
and it was not difficult for them to stay 
quiet. When night came, they all went to sleep.

2033
03:43:50,239 --> 03:43:55,120
Early next morning, the Emperor 
woke and called for his secretaries.

2034
03:43:56,319 --> 03:44:01,519
'All night I could not sleep because 
I was thinking of good enough words  

2035
03:44:01,520 --> 03:44:08,880
to thank my brother for his success. I 
have now, in my head, a few sentences,  

2036
03:44:09,439 --> 03:44:13,759
although they are nothing compared 
to the wisdom of the Scriptures.'

2037
03:44:15,439 --> 03:44:18,399
He asked the secretaries to write down his words,  

2038
03:44:18,960 --> 03:44:25,040
which later became known to all as the 
Introduction to Buddha's Holy Teachings.

2039
03:44:26,960 --> 03:44:33,359
The Emperor then asked Tripitaka to read from 
some of the Holy Scriptures in the holiest  

2040
03:44:33,359 --> 03:44:40,559
temple in the city. As the Scriptures were so 
valuable, the Emperor ordered his secretaries  

2041
03:44:40,560 --> 03:44:46,161
to make copies, which were later 
sent to every city in China.

2042
03:44:47,760 --> 03:44:54,560
As Tripitaka started reading, he smelled the 
sweet wind and the Protectors appeared in the  

2043
03:44:54,560 --> 03:45:03,200
air above the pilgrims. They said, 'You must all 
leave the Scriptures and follow us to the West.'

2044
03:45:04,560 --> 03:45:12,320
At once Monkey and the others, including the white 
horse, got up from the ground. Tripitaka put down  

2045
03:45:12,319 --> 03:45:18,160
the Scripture that he had started reading. He 
was lifted straight up to the Ninth Heaven.  

2046
03:45:19,120 --> 03:45:24,160
The Emperor and his ministers bowed low 
to the ground as they were carried away.

2047
03:45:25,600 --> 03:45:28,800
Later, all the people of the city prayed  

2048
03:45:28,800 --> 03:45:34,080
and read the Great Scriptures, and 
their lives were much better after that.

2049
03:45:35,439 --> 03:45:41,120
The four pilgrims and the white horse 
were taken back to Buddha's Holy Mountain  

2050
03:45:41,120 --> 03:45:49,359
by the Protectors. There they found that 
their great journey had taken just eight days.  

2051
03:45:50,239 --> 03:45:55,279
On the Holy Mountain they and 
all the Gods waited for Buddha.

2052
03:45:57,120 --> 03:46:02,720
When everyone was ready, Buddha 
appeared and spoke first to Tripitaka.

2053
03:46:03,920 --> 03:46:12,399
'Holy priest,' he said, 'in a past life you 
were close to me and you were called Golden  

2054
03:46:12,399 --> 03:46:21,359
Tree. But because you did not obey my teaching, 
you had to start life again in the East. Now you  

2055
03:46:21,359 --> 03:46:30,559
have obeyed me so well that I am making you a 
Buddha. Your title will be Buddha of Ability.

2056
03:46:32,080 --> 03:46:39,920
'Monkey, because you made trouble in Heaven, you 
were put under the Mountain of Metal, Wood, Water,  

2057
03:46:39,920 --> 03:46:48,239
Fire and Earth. Fortunately, when your time there 
was finished, you turned your heart to religion,  

2058
03:46:48,800 --> 03:46:57,120
to the fight against wrongdoing and the fight for 
good. On your recent journey you have done so well  

2059
03:46:57,760 --> 03:47:05,840
that I am making you a Buddha. You will be 
the Buddha of Success in Difficult Times.

2060
03:47:08,000 --> 03:47:16,239
'Pigsy, you were a soldier of the water armies 
of Heaven. But at a banquet you drank too much  

2061
03:47:16,239 --> 03:47:21,599
and insulted a goddess. And for this 
you were born again in the human world,  

2062
03:47:22,160 --> 03:47:28,559
looking very much like an animal. When 
you were living at the Cloud-Ladder Cave,  

2063
03:47:28,560 --> 03:47:36,800
you found religion and offered your protection to 
Tripitaka on his journey. You are still greedy,  

2064
03:47:37,520 --> 03:47:45,840
but because you carried the luggage all the way, I 
am now making you the Keeper of the Holy Temple.'

2065
03:47:46,880 --> 03:47:54,800
'Hey!' said Pigsy. 'You have just made the 
others Buddhas. Why am I not a Buddha too?'

2066
03:47:56,000 --> 03:48:03,199
'Because,' answered Buddha, 'your conversation 
and appearance are still not fine enough  

2067
03:48:03,760 --> 03:48:10,560
and you still eat too much. But I 
have so many followers in the world  

2068
03:48:10,560 --> 03:48:17,680
that you will get plenty to eat in your new 
job. You will have nothing to complain about.'

2069
03:48:19,359 --> 03:48:24,559
Pigsy knew that he had to accept his 
new job. He did not say another word.

2070
03:48:26,319 --> 03:48:34,399
'Sandy, you were a great spirit, but at a banquet 
you broke a dish of great value and you were sent  

2071
03:48:34,399 --> 03:48:41,839
to the human world. There you lived in the 
River of Sands and you hungrily ate people.  

2072
03:48:42,800 --> 03:48:51,920
But after that you found religion. You promised to 
protect and help Tripitaka, and you did. Because  

2073
03:48:51,920 --> 03:49:00,880
of this, I am lifting you high among us and 
giving you the title of Golden-Bodied Soldier.'

2074
03:49:02,399 --> 03:49:06,719
Sandy bowed. Happily, he accepted his new title.

2075
03:49:08,399 --> 03:49:16,559
Then Buddha turned to the white horse. 'You,' 
he said, 'were a child of the Dragon King of  

2076
03:49:16,560 --> 03:49:25,280
the Western Ocean, but you disobeyed your father 
and were guilty of bad behaviour. Fortunately,  

2077
03:49:25,840 --> 03:49:31,680
you found religion. Because you 
carried Tripitaka to the West,  

2078
03:49:31,680 --> 03:49:37,840
and the Holy Scriptures on the return 
journey, you too must have your reward.  

2079
03:49:39,040 --> 03:49:44,880
From this day, you will be one 
of the eight Heavenly Dragons.'

2080
03:49:46,399 --> 03:49:49,599
The white horse made a sign 
to show how grateful it was.  

2081
03:49:50,319 --> 03:49:55,840
It was led to the back of the Holy Mountain, 
where there was the Pool of Magic Dragons,  

2082
03:49:55,840 --> 03:50:03,440
and it was pushed into the pool. After a short 
time, it began to change shape and its coat began  

2083
03:50:03,439 --> 03:50:12,639
to change to a golden colour. Its four feet rested 
on the clouds and then it flew up out of the pool.  

2084
03:50:13,439 --> 03:50:17,679
It was now changed from a horse to a magic dragon.

2085
03:50:19,040 --> 03:50:24,479
'Master,' said Monkey to Tripitaka, 
'I am now a Buddha, like you.  

2086
03:50:25,359 --> 03:50:28,639
I should not have to wear a cap 
so that you can control me.'

2087
03:50:29,920 --> 03:50:37,440
'It was put on you,' said Tripitaka, 'at a time 
when you knew nothing. Then we needed to control  

2088
03:50:37,439 --> 03:50:47,839
you. Now you are a Buddha and it has gone. Feel 
your head and you will see. It is not there now.'

2089
03:50:49,199 --> 03:50:53,199
Monkey put his hand on his 
head. Tripitaka was right;  

2090
03:50:53,920 --> 03:50:59,760
the cap had gone. A grateful 
smile spread across his face.

2091
03:51:01,120 --> 03:51:05,840
All the spirits of Heaven 
watched as Tripitaka, Monkey,

2092
03:51:05,840 --> 03:51:11,040
Pigsy, Sandy and the horse 
received their new, holy titles.

2093
03:51:12,160 --> 03:51:15,359
While they went to their places in the Great Hall,  

2094
03:51:15,359 --> 03:51:21,519
many loud voices began to pray to them. 
They were accepted with open arms.  

2095
03:51:22,319 --> 03:51:31,199
And from that day, Pigsy did not shout for more 
food and Monkey and Sandy behaved perfectly.  

2096
03:51:32,319 --> 03:51:39,920
The reason for this was simple. All three 
had received the greatest of gifts - wisdom.

2097
03:51:41,840 --> 03:51:49,120
I give this, my book, to you, dear reader, so 
you can understand the beauty of Buddha's Land.  

2098
03:51:49,920 --> 03:51:53,840
It will be a reward for kindness, and it will help  

2099
03:51:53,840 --> 03:52:00,560
with the suffering of the lost souls of this 
world. I would like to think that my readers  

2100
03:52:00,560 --> 03:52:11,840
will turn their hearts towards the True Way, and 
will be born again in the World of True Happiness.

 --> 00:02:48,770
Look at him!

34
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:56,300
He shuts his eyes, and with one big jump he
passes through the curtain of water.

35
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:00,270
But there is no water where he has landed.

36
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:06,370
Instead he finds a great, shining iron bridge
in front of him.

37
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:11,230
Monkey walked along the bridge and came to
a cave.

38
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:18,790
Outside the cave there was a sign: This Cave
of the Water Curtain in the Country of the

39
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:24,319
Mountain of Flowers and Fruit Leads to Heaven.

40
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:28,120
Monkey laughed and jumped with happiness.

41
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:35,330
He ran back across the bridge, shut his eyes
and jumped through the waterfall to the other

42
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:36,330
monkeys.

43
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:39,480
'Good news!' he shouted.

44
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,630
'Good news!

45
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:44,200
Come with me, all of you!'

46
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:50,120
They followed the Stone Monkey to the Cave
of the Water Curtain.

47
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:54,630
There the Stone Monkey sat down and talked
to them.

48
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:57,459
'Gentlemen!' he said.

49
00:03:57,459 --> 00:04:02,840
'I have been through the waterfall and have
come back again.

50
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:10,319
I have given you a home in this cave, so am
I not your king now?'

51
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:17,430
The monkeys bowed to the Stone Monkey and
they all cried, 'Great King for a thousand

52
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:18,470
years!'

53
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:28,389
The Stone Monkey became the Monkey King and
he made other monkeys his ministers.

54
00:04:28,389 --> 00:04:30,809
And all the monkeys were happy.

55
00:04:30,809 --> 00:04:37,949
During the day they walked and played on the
Mountain of Flowers and Fruit, and at night

56
00:04:37,949 --> 00:04:41,909
they slept in the Cave of the Water Curtain.

57
00:04:41,909 --> 00:04:44,509
They had everything they wanted.

58
00:04:44,509 --> 00:04:48,219
Their lives were complete.

59
00:04:48,219 --> 00:04:54,999
The Monkey King enjoyed this simple life for
several hundred years.

60
00:04:54,999 --> 00:05:02,509
But one day at a great party with all the
other monkeys, he suddenly started to cry.

61
00:05:02,509 --> 00:05:08,930
The other monkeys all bowed, saying, 'Why
is our king so sad?'

62
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:14,199
'Today,' said the Monkey King, 'I am not sad.

63
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:17,779
But I am worried about the future.

64
00:05:17,779 --> 00:05:23,860
Sadly, the time will come when I will become
old and weak.

65
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:29,270
Yama, King of Death, is waiting to destroy
me.

66
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:33,210
I do not want to be born again on Earth.

67
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:38,949
How can I live for all time among the people
of the sky?'

68
00:05:38,949 --> 00:05:45,939
The monkeys all started to cry, each thinking
of his own mortality.

69
00:05:45,939 --> 00:05:54,059
One of them said, 'Only Buddhas and Immortals
do not go to Yama, King of Death.

70
00:05:54,059 --> 00:05:57,149
Only they live forever.'

71
00:05:57,149 --> 00:06:00,810
'Where can I find these Immortals?'

72
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:03,419
asked the Monkey King.

73
00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:09,430
'Here on Earth they live in very old caves
far to the West.'

74
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:15,399
'Tomorrow,' said the Monkey King, 'I shall
say goodbye to you.

75
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:20,419
I shall go down the mountain and travel to
the end of the world.

76
00:06:20,419 --> 00:06:27,969
I want to learn to live for all time and to
escape from death.'

77
00:06:27,969 --> 00:06:35,259
Next morning, he walked to the sea and sailed
in a boat to the borders of the Southern World.

78
00:06:35,259 --> 00:06:38,789
There he climbed out on to the beach.

79
00:06:38,789 --> 00:06:47,919
And then he walked and walked, through towns
and cities, to the West.

80
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:53,860
On the way, he learned to wear clothes and
to behave like a human.

81
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:58,580
But he met humans who wanted only to be rich
and famous.

82
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:04,039
He met nobody who worried about his mortality.

83
00:07:04,039 --> 00:07:10,659
One day, he came to the Western Ocean, where
he built another boat.

84
00:07:10,659 --> 00:07:18,399
Then he sailed to the Western Continent, where
he saw a very high and beautiful wooded mountain.

85
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:26,009
At the top of the mountain was the Cave of
the Moon and Three Stars, where the Immortal

86
00:07:26,009 --> 00:07:28,650
Subodhi lived.

87
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:34,180
Monkey at once bowed and touched the ground
with his head three times.

88
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:39,110
'Where do you come from?' asked the Immortal.

89
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:45,379
'I am from the Cave of the Water Curtain,'
said Monkey, 'on the Mountain of Flowers and

90
00:07:45,379 --> 00:07:48,099
Fruit in the country of Ao-lai.'

91
00:07:48,099 --> 00:07:51,129
'That is impossible!'

92
00:07:51,129 --> 00:07:52,989
shouted the Immortal.

93
00:07:52,989 --> 00:07:58,679
'Between there and here are two oceans and
the whole of the Southern Continent.

94
00:07:58,679 --> 00:08:00,709
You are lying!'

95
00:08:00,709 --> 00:08:08,169
'I have sailed across the oceans and walked
over the continents for more than ten years,'

96
00:08:08,169 --> 00:08:09,169
said Monkey.

97
00:08:09,169 --> 00:08:13,860
'At last I have reached here.'

98
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:19,050
Monkey told the Immortal how he had come from
a magic stone.

99
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:25,520
The Immortal thought that Monkey was a natural
product of Heaven and Earth, so he agreed

100
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,520
to teach him.

101
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,300
Monkey jumped up and down with happiness.

102
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:37,979
Day after day, he and the other students learned
to speak and behave correctly.

103
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:43,328
They learned to write well and to study the
Scriptures.

104
00:08:43,328 --> 00:08:47,959
When they were not studying, the students
grew flowers and trees.

105
00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:51,350
They lit fires and fetched water.

106
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:56,800
And so Monkey lived in this way for six or
seven years.

107
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:03,170
Finally, the Immortal sent for Monkey late
one night because he wanted to teach him the

108
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:07,279
Way of Long Life.

109
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:13,250
'Come close and listen carefully,' said the
Immortal.

110
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:20,290
Monkey went down on his knees on the floor
at the Immortal's feet, listening carefully.

111
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:25,730
The Immortal recited a magic poem with many
lines.

112
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:33,110
The words shook Monkey's soul and he was never
the same Monkey again.

113
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:41,379
He thanked the Immortal many times, because
now he knew the Way of Long Life.

114
00:09:41,379 --> 00:09:49,060
Time passed quickly and three years later
the Immortal again invited Monkey to his room,

115
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:54,279
where he taught him seventy-two transformations.

116
00:09:54,279 --> 00:10:00,190
Monkey was a quick learner and he practised
until he could change himself into something

117
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:05,490
else, using all seventy-two ways.

118
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:11,500
One day, when the Immortal and his students
were in front of the cave admiring the evening

119
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:15,470
view, the Immortal spoke to Monkey.

120
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:19,350
'Monkey, how much have you learned?'

121
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:24,130
'Thanks to you,' said Monkey, 'I have learned
a lot.

122
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:30,220
In addition to changing myself into other
forms, I can already fly.'

123
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:36,180
'Let me see you do it,' said the Immortal.

124
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:42,150
Monkey put his feet together, jumped twenty
metres into the air and rode the clouds for

125
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:43,930
a few minutes.

126
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:51,110
Then he dropped to the ground, saying, 'You
see, I can ride the clouds.'

127
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:56,380
'That is not riding the clouds,' said the
Immortal, laughing.

128
00:10:56,380 --> 00:11:04,050
'A real cloud-rider can start in the morning
from the Northern Sea, cross the Eastern,

129
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:10,640
the Western and the Southern Seas and land
again in one day.'

130
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,910
'It sounds very difficult,' said Monkey.

131
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:19,750
'Nothing in the world is difficult,' said
the Immortal.

132
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:25,220
'Only our own thoughts make things seem difficult.

133
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:32,189
Now I will teach you to fly from one continent
to another.'

134
00:11:32,189 --> 00:11:38,980
The other students laughed, saying, 'If Monkey
flies all that way, he will be able to earn

135
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,519
a living as a postman.'

136
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:47,220
But Monkey spent all night practising what
the Immortal had taught him.

137
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:53,069
By morning he could fly wherever he wanted.

138
00:11:53,069 --> 00:11:57,089
One summer day, some students were sitting
under a tree.

139
00:11:57,089 --> 00:12:05,290
A student said, 'Monkey, why do you deserve
private teaching by the Immortal?

140
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:10,189
Has he taught you the transformations, by
all the seventy-two ways?'

141
00:12:10,189 --> 00:12:18,040
'I have been working on them day and night
and now I can do them all,' said Monkey.

142
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,120
'Could you show us?'

143
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:28,209
Proudly, Monkey made a magic sign, said some
magic words and transformed himself into a

144
00:12:28,209 --> 00:12:29,220
tree.

145
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:33,980
'Well done, Monkey, well done!'

146
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,310
shouted the other students.

147
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:38,029
They all laughed.

148
00:12:38,029 --> 00:12:42,810
The Immortal heard their laughter and he came
running out from the cave.

149
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:48,770
'Who is making all this noise?' he asked.

150
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:53,850
Monkey changed himself back from a tree to
a monkey.

151
00:12:53,850 --> 00:13:00,920
He sat with the students again and said, 'Immortal,
we are practising our lessons out here.'

152
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:06,749
'You were all shouting and laughing!' said
the Immortal, angrily.

153
00:13:06,749 --> 00:13:10,200
'I want to know why.'

154
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:18,430
Then one student said, 'Monkey was transforming
himself into a tree, just for fun.'

155
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:22,100
'You, Monkey, come here!'

156
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,279
shouted the Immortal.

157
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:28,889
'Why do you think I taught you these secrets
of life?

158
00:13:28,889 --> 00:13:32,220
So you can make other people laugh?'

159
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:36,529
'I am very sorry,' said Monkey.

160
00:13:36,529 --> 00:13:41,760
'I will not punish you,' said the Immortal.

161
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,949
'But you cannot stay here.

162
00:13:43,949 --> 00:13:47,809
You must leave us.'

163
00:13:47,809 --> 00:13:49,410
Monkey started to cry.

164
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:53,259
'Where can I go?' he asked.

165
00:13:53,259 --> 00:13:56,579
'Go back to where you came from.

166
00:13:56,579 --> 00:14:00,069
Go as quickly as you can.

167
00:14:00,069 --> 00:14:03,949
Never tell anyone that you were a student
of mine.

168
00:14:03,949 --> 00:14:09,839
I am sure that no good will come of your life.'

169
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,699
And so poor Monkey said goodbye to everybody.

170
00:14:13,699 --> 00:14:20,240
He flew back to the Eastern Sea and his home
in the Cave of the Water Curtain on the Mountain

171
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,579
of Flowers and Fruit.

172
00:14:22,579 --> 00:14:29,420
'Little ones,' shouted the Monkey King, 'I
have come back!'

173
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:37,390
At once, big and small monkeys leapt out of
trees with cries of 'Long live our King!'

174
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:45,470
Then, pushing each other to get near him,
they cried, 'Why did you go for so long?

175
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:49,230
We have been watching for your return day
after day!

176
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:57,449
While you were away, a demon took our cave
and everything we own and many of our children.

177
00:14:57,449 --> 00:15:02,160
Now we dare not sleep, night or day.'

178
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,569
'What demon dares to do this?'

179
00:15:05,569 --> 00:15:06,569
cried Monkey.

180
00:15:06,569 --> 00:15:09,379
'I will make him pay!'

181
00:15:09,379 --> 00:15:16,040
'King, he is called the Destroying Demon,
and he lives north of here.

182
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:23,940
But he comes and goes like a cloud, like wind,
like rain, like thunder and lightning, so

183
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:28,629
we do not know where his home is or how far
away.'

184
00:15:28,629 --> 00:15:31,639
'Well, don't worry,' said Monkey.

185
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:35,059
'I will go and look for him.'

186
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:37,300
Dear Monkey!

187
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:45,149
He leapt into the sky and soon saw in front
of him a high mountain and a cave, where the

188
00:15:45,149 --> 00:15:48,740
Destroying Demon was waiting for him.

189
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:53,009
'Where is the owner of the Cave of the Water
Curtain?'

190
00:15:53,009 --> 00:15:55,690
cried the Demon.

191
00:15:55,690 --> 00:16:02,819
'You have such large eyes,' shouted Monkey,
'but you cannot see Monkey?'

192
00:16:02,819 --> 00:16:04,389
'Oh!

193
00:16:04,389 --> 00:16:07,149
You are not half a metre high!

194
00:16:07,149 --> 00:16:14,189
If I killed such a small creature with my
sword, I would look foolish.'

195
00:16:14,189 --> 00:16:20,720
So the two of them fought with their hands
and feet, hitting and kicking each other.

196
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:25,100
Soon the Demon was fighting like a wild animal.

197
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:31,009
Monkey pulled out some hairs from his chest
and, crying 'Change!'

198
00:16:31,009 --> 00:16:33,259
threw them into the air.

199
00:16:33,259 --> 00:16:38,399
At once, they became several hundred small
monkeys.

200
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:44,149
See how the monkeys jump on the Demon, pulling
and hitting him.

201
00:16:44,149 --> 00:16:50,870
Then Monkey takes up the Demon's great sword
and brings it down on his head, breaking it

202
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:52,300
in two.

203
00:16:52,300 --> 00:17:01,050
Then, by his magic, he transforms all the
monkeys back into hairs.

204
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:06,369
When Monkey returned home to the cave on the
Mountain of Flowers and Fruit, he brought

205
00:17:06,369 --> 00:17:12,639
the great sword of the Destroying Demon, and
he amused the other monkeys by teaching them

206
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,199
to make weapons of wood.

207
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:21,919
Then, one day, the Monkey King called all
the other monkeys to him.

208
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:28,980
'All this,' he said, pointing to their wooden
weapons, 'is only a game.

209
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:34,020
We cannot defend ourselves from a real enemy
with these.'

210
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:38,279
'We know a city that is full of soldiers.

211
00:17:38,279 --> 00:17:43,240
They must have plenty of weapons,' the others
said.

212
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:46,210
They quickly told Monkey where it was.

213
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:50,770
'Stay here and amuse yourselves,' Monkey said.

214
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:53,789
'I will see what I can do.'

215
00:17:53,789 --> 00:17:56,510
Dear Monkey!

216
00:17:56,510 --> 00:18:03,279
Using his magic, he flew to the city and,
with his breath, blew such a strong wind that

217
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:07,240
all the people locked themselves indoors.

218
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,159
This was his chance.

219
00:18:09,159 --> 00:18:15,450
He found where the weapons were kept, kicked
down the door, and changed his hairs into

220
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:20,020
thousands of small monkeys who took the weapons.

221
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:26,059
Carried on a magic wind, they were soon back
at the cave.

222
00:18:26,059 --> 00:18:33,370
The monkeys learned to use the weapons, and
all sorts of wild animals and demon kings

223
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:39,000
began to call Monkey their king.

224
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:46,610
But Monkey found his own weapon too heavy,
so he went to the Dragon of the Eastern Sea

225
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:49,770
in search of something lighter.

226
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:56,529
The Dragon King welcomed him to the palace,
with his dragon children, dragon grandchildren

227
00:18:56,529 --> 00:19:00,370
and fish soldiers.

228
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:06,750
Monkey made his request, and a fish soldier
brought out a great sword.

229
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:11,779
'Too heavy,' said Monkey.

230
00:19:11,779 --> 00:19:15,700
More fish soldiers brought out an enormous
fork.

231
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:20,040
'Too light,' said Monkey.

232
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:26,390
The dragon mother and her daughter came from
a back room in the palace and suggested their

233
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:28,900
magic iron cudgel.

234
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:35,681
'The Gods used it when they decided how deep
the rivers and the seas should be,' said the

235
00:19:35,681 --> 00:19:37,100
Dragon King.

236
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:41,200
He agreed that Monkey should have it.

237
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:48,010
When it was brought, Monkey saw that it was
a thick piece of iron six metres long.

238
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:52,500
He used his magic to bring it down to less
than a metre.

239
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:58,850
Then he waved it over his head, striking terror
into everybody in the room.

240
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:06,750
But now he demanded something to wear, to
go with the weapon, and this was too much.

241
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:15,269
A pair of cloud-stepping shoes, a cap of red
gold and a coat of light metal were brought

242
00:20:15,269 --> 00:20:22,870
to him, but the angry Dragon King also sent
for his brothers from the Southern, Northern

243
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:29,299
and Western Seas and told them about Monkey's
many requests.

244
00:20:29,299 --> 00:20:32,100
The Dragon of the South was angry.

245
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:35,549
'Put him in prison!' he cried.

246
00:20:35,549 --> 00:20:39,409
'No, no,' warned the Dragon King.

247
00:20:39,409 --> 00:20:42,450
'We cannot go near him now.

248
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:47,520
If he touches us with that iron cudgel, he
will kill us.

249
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,170
Let him keep the clothes.

250
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:57,180
We will complain to Heaven, and Heaven will
punish him.'

251
00:20:57,180 --> 00:21:04,270
Monkey took the clothes, but he knew that
they were going to complain about him.

252
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:10,390
Soon after that, the Jade Emperor received
the complaint from the Dragon of the Eastern

253
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:11,810
Sea.

254
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:20,900
'How long,' the Jade Emperor asked his ministers,
'has this Monkey existed, and why does he

255
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:23,350
behave like an Immortal?'

256
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:30,980
'In the last three hundred years, he has learned
a lot,' said a minister.

257
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:38,340
'Let's give him work here in Heaven where
we will be able to watch hint.'

258
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:43,919
This suggestion pleased the Jade Emperor,
and a minister was sent to bring Monkey to

259
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:45,409
Heaven.

260
00:21:45,409 --> 00:21:51,470
Monkey tidied his clothes, told the older
monkeys to look after the younger ones, and

261
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:53,950
followed the minister to Heaven.

262
00:21:53,950 --> 00:22:00,130
'I am going to give you a job,' said the Jade
Emperor to Monkey.

263
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:05,550
'You are going to look after the Apple Garden.'

264
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:11,520
Monkey was very happy and ran to the Apple
Garden to start work.

265
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:16,730
He was told that on the outer side of the
garden were special apples.

266
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:21,890
They were ready to eat once in three thousand
years.

267
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:28,429
If you ate one of these, you would become
wise, with strong arms and legs and a light

268
00:22:28,429 --> 00:22:30,929
body.

269
00:22:30,929 --> 00:22:38,769
In the middle were trees with apples that
were ready to eat once in six thousand years.

270
00:22:38,769 --> 00:22:46,580
If you ate these, you would go up in the air
and stay there, and would never grow old.

271
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:55,039
At the back were trees with apples chat were
ready to eat once in nine thousand years.

272
00:22:55,039 --> 00:23:02,180
If you ate these, you would live longer than
Heaven and Earth.

273
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:04,730
Monkey was very happy with this information.

274
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:11,799
He watched the trees closely, making up his
mind to eat the fruit before anybody else

275
00:23:11,799 --> 00:23:14,470
got a chance.

276
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:20,690
Soon, noticing that some apples were ready
to eat, he sent his helpers away.

277
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:28,270
He climbed into a high tree and ate until
he could eat no more.

278
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:34,720
When the Queen of Heaven sent her lady assistants
for apples, they were turned away at the gates

279
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,580
by Monkey's helpers.

280
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:40,770
'We must ask the Monkey King first,' they
said.

281
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:44,520
'He is resting in one of the trees.'

282
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:50,660
But when they came to the tree, they found
only Monkey's cap and shoes.

283
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:53,260
They could not see him.

284
00:23:53,260 --> 00:24:01,610
In fact, Monkey had made himself five centimetres
long and was asleep under a leaf.

285
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:08,529
The Queen of Heaven's lady assistants picked
three basketfuls from each of the first two

286
00:24:08,529 --> 00:24:10,909
groups of trees.

287
00:24:10,909 --> 00:24:16,580
When they came to the third, they found just
one apple.

288
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:20,260
When one of the ladies tried to pick it, Monkey
woke up.

289
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:23,950
At once, he changed back to his true size.

290
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:26,450
'Who are you?'

291
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:28,360
shouted Monkey.

292
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,990
The lady assistants went down on their knees.

293
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:34,620
'Monkey King, don't be angry.

294
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:39,250
We were sent by the Queen and we could not
find you.

295
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:41,330
Please forgive us.'

296
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:47,740
'Get up from your knees,' said Monkey, his
voice full of kindness.

297
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:52,480
'I have heard that the Queen of Heaven is
having a banquet.

298
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:57,450
Can you tell me who is invited?'

299
00:24:57,450 --> 00:25:03,860
Monkey was told that all the Immortals, Emperors
of the Four Quarters and Gods of the seas

300
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:06,610
and hills would be there.

301
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:10,880
He immediately asked, 'Will I be invited?'

302
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:15,530
'I have not heard,' said one of the lady assistants.

303
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:17,860
'We do not know.'

304
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:21,639
'Quite right, ladies,' said Monkey.

305
00:25:21,639 --> 00:25:25,770
'Just wait here while I go and see.'

306
00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:28,580
Dear Monkey!

307
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:33,799
He recited some magic lines, crying 'Stay,
stay, stay!'

308
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:43,600
The lady assistants were suddenly unable to
move while he went off on his magic cloud.

309
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:49,669
No one had arrived at the banquet yet, but
Monkey could smell the food and wine.

310
00:25:49,669 --> 00:25:53,330
He sent the servants to sleep by magic.

311
00:25:53,330 --> 00:26:01,190
Look at them, how their hands fall to their
sides, their heads drop on to their chests,

312
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:04,789
their eyes close!

313
00:26:04,789 --> 00:26:11,429
Monkey then took some of the finest and best
of the food and drank glass after glass of

314
00:26:11,429 --> 00:26:15,880
wine until he was quite drunk.

315
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,860
'Bad!

316
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:21,580
Bad!' he thought to himself.

317
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:30,850
'I will certainly get into trouble, so I will
go home and sleep.'

318
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:33,710
But it was too late for that.

319
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:38,630
Back at the Apple Garden, the Queen's ladies
were finally saved.

320
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:47,590
They reported that the Monkey King had eaten
many of the biggest apples and had now disappeared.

321
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:54,399
When the great Goddess Kuan-yin arrived for
the banquet, she found half the food eaten

322
00:26:54,399 --> 00:26:58,090
and all the wine gone.

323
00:26:58,090 --> 00:27:04,539
When the servants were woken, they explained
that the Monkey King had sent them to sleep.

324
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:08,850
That was the last time they had seen the food
and the wine.

325
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:16,270
The Jade Emperor was informed and he sent
heavenly soldiers to find Monkey.

326
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:24,090
Monkey was burned in fire for nine days, and
at the end of it his eyes were red but he

327
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:26,200
was still alive.

328
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:31,440
He was attacked with swords and the Gods of
Thunder threw thunder at him.

329
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:35,440
But nothing could destroy him.

330
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:42,169
In the end, hearing of this situation, the
great Buddha himself arrived and called Monkey

331
00:27:42,169 --> 00:27:43,880
to him.

332
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:52,480
'How long ago,' he asked him, 'did you try
to become an Immortal and learn the things

333
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:57,370
that make you dare behave like this?'

334
00:27:57,370 --> 00:27:59,980
Monkey at once recited:

335
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:04,740
Born of Earth and Sky, I am a magic Immortal.

336
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:09,000
I am an old monkey from the Mountain of Flowers
and Fruit;

337
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,770
In the Cave of the Water Curtain, I work and
laugh and play.

338
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:18,830
I found a friend and teacher who taught me
the Great Secret;

339
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:23,259
I made myself perfect in the Ways of Immortality,

340
00:28:23,259 --> 00:28:27,289
I learned transformations without limit or
end,

341
00:28:27,289 --> 00:28:33,200
I tired of the narrow world of men, and lived
in the Jade Heaven.

342
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,529
But why should Heaven's palace have only one
emperor?

343
00:28:37,529 --> 00:28:43,640
On Earth king follows king, as the strong
bow to the stronger.

344
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:48,480
Only a hero fights with the Gods of Gods.

345
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,049
That was what Monkey recited.

346
00:28:51,049 --> 00:28:53,330
Buddha laughed.

347
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:57,809
'But you are only a monkey-spirit,' he said.

348
00:28:57,809 --> 00:29:04,440
'The Jade Emperor has been making himself
perfect for countless years.

349
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:09,230
How can you hope to take his place and become
emperor yourself?

350
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:13,659
You are only an animal that looks half human!

351
00:29:13,659 --> 00:29:16,940
Talk no more of this.'

352
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:21,330
'Why should he be emperor for all time?

353
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:25,330
Tell him to go and to give me my chance,'
said Monkey.

354
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:27,620
'That is all I ask.

355
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:32,130
And if he will not, I will see that he never
has any peace.'

356
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:39,309
'What magic have you got that would help you
to take Heaven for yourself?'

357
00:29:39,309 --> 00:29:43,419
'I have a lot of magic,' replied Monkey.

358
00:29:43,419 --> 00:29:47,690
'I can jump through the clouds from continent
to continent.

359
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:52,990
Am I not good enough to live in the palaces
of Heaven?'

360
00:29:52,990 --> 00:30:02,210
Buddha said, 'If you are really so clever,
you will sit here in my right hand and then

361
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:03,210
jump off.

362
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:08,240
If you succeed, you can become the Jade Emperor.

363
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:16,490
But if you fail, you will go back to Earth
and you will be punished for centuries.'

364
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:20,850
Monkey thought, 'This Buddha is a complete
fool.

365
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:25,970
How could I fail to jump off his hand!'

366
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:31,880
Buddha held out his hand, which looked about
the size of a large leaf.

367
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:37,159
Monkey took the magic iron cudgel that the
Dragon King had given him, and that he had

368
00:30:37,159 --> 00:30:40,649
transformed into a stick the size of a needle.

369
00:30:40,649 --> 00:30:48,510
He put it behind his ear and then he jumped
from the hand as far and as fast as he could.

370
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:55,590
He was flying very fast, but Buddha watched
him with the eye of wisdom.

371
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:59,629
Monkey came at last to five high pink towers.

372
00:30:59,629 --> 00:31:05,200
'This must be the end of the world,' said
Monkey to himself.

373
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:12,350
'Now I will return to Buddha, become emperor,
and all Heaven will be mine.

374
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:18,169
But I had better leave some sign that I was
here.'

375
00:31:18,169 --> 00:31:25,260
Pulling out a hair, he changed it into a writing-brush
heavy with ink, and at the bottom of the middle

376
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:33,350
tower he wrote: The great Monkey King reached
this place.

377
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:37,230
Then he jumped back to where he had come from.

378
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:43,120
Standing on Buddha's hand, he said, 'I have
gone and I have returned.

379
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:48,029
You can tell the Jade Emperor that his job
is mine.'

380
00:31:48,029 --> 00:31:56,840
'You smelly creature,' said Buddha, 'you have
been on my hand all the time.'

381
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:59,549
'You are completely wrong,' said Monkey.

382
00:31:59,549 --> 00:32:06,600
'I travelled to the end of the world, saw
five pink towers and wrote on one of them.

383
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:09,980
Would you like me to take you and show you?'

384
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:14,130
'No need,' said Buddha.

385
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:16,580
'Just look down.'

386
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:22,450
Monkey looked down, with his eyes still red
from the nine days of fire.

387
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:29,409
There, at the bottom of the middle finger
of Buddha's hand, he saw the words "The great

388
00:32:29,409 --> 00:32:34,600
Monkey King reached this place."

389
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:40,730
Monkey could not speak and his red eyes opened
wide in surprise.

390
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:43,769
At last he said, 'Impossible!

391
00:32:43,769 --> 00:32:44,769
Impossible!

392
00:32:44,769 --> 00:32:49,690
I wrote that on a tower going high into the
sky.

393
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:53,279
How did it get on the Buddha's finger?

394
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:54,789
It is magic!

395
00:32:54,789 --> 00:32:57,240
I shall go back to look!'

396
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,480
Dear Monkey!

397
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:06,780
He was preparing to jump again when Buddha
pushed him out of the Western Gate of Heaven.

398
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:16,220
As he did, he changed his five fingers into
Metal, Wood, Water, Fire and Earth.

399
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:24,110
They became a mountain which pressed poor
Monkey down with its great weight.

400
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:31,330
The name Mountain of Metal, Wood, Water, Fire
and Earth was written on a large rock on the

401
00:33:31,330 --> 00:33:33,549
mountain.

402
00:33:33,549 --> 00:33:40,129
Under the mountain there was enough air for
Monkey to breathe, but no opening which Monkey's

403
00:33:40,129 --> 00:33:44,760
head or hand could squeeze through.

404
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:50,730
Buddha then told a spirit to look after Monkey
and give him food and drink.

405
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:59,830
'And when the days of his punishment are finished,'
said Buddha, 'a man will come here and save

406
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:02,200
him.'

407
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:10,409
Time passed, and then one day the Buddha said
to hi
