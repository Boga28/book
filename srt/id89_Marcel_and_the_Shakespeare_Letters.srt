1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:09,000
Marcel is a French mouse. He's a detective
and he lives in Paris. But Marcel doesn't

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:20,760
live in Pans all year. Every November he visits
London. His old friend - Henry - has a small

3
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,949
flat there.

4
00:00:23,949 --> 00:00:38,500
Marcel loves London. The beautiful buildings...
the big, black taxis... the museums and shops.

5
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:45,780
He loves Paris, but he loves London too.

6
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:55,650
This story is about one of Marcel's November
holidays. It starts at three o'clock on a

7
00:00:55,650 --> 00:01:06,261
Tuesday afternoon. Marcel is walking from
Knightsbridge station to Henry's flat. He

8
00:01:06,261 --> 00:01:10,670
has two heavy bags with him.

9
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:30,460
Henry's address is 42 Old Wilton Street. Marcel
looks at the numbers - 36 - 38 - 40. Yes,

10
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:35,400
here it is. Number 42.

11
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:48,030
He sees a sign. It says: 'Professor J. T.
Barton'. Marcel looks at it and thinks, 'That's

12
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:54,049
new.' Then he goes down to Henry's flat.

13
00:01:54,049 --> 00:01:57,920
Henry opens the door and smiles.

14
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:05,000
'Marcel!' he says. 'Come in, come in!'

15
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,890
'Hello, Henry,' Marcel says.

16
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:14,110
'How are you?' (His English is very good.)

17
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:17,569
'I'm very well. And you?'

18
00:02:17,569 --> 00:02:20,590
'Yes, thanks.'

19
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:32,540
'Good, good.' Henry takes Marcel's coat. 'Now,'
he says, 'let's have some tea.'

20
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:39,800
The two friends sit in big chairs. They drink
tea and talk.

21
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:51,670
At five o'clock Marcel says, 'There's a new
person in number 42. What's his name? Burton?

22
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:53,400
Barnam?'

23
00:02:53,400 --> 00:03:04,739
'Barton,' Henry says. 'Professor Barton. He's
very, very clever. And that's not all. After

24
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:10,500
tomorrow he's going to be famous, too!'

25
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:17,200
'Famous?!' Marcel looks at his English friend.
'Why?'

26
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:25,590
'It's a very interesting story,' Henry says.
'He has some letters. They were under the

27
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:29,840
floor of an old woman's house in Oxford.'

28
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:35,480
'And...?' Marcel says.

29
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:41,890
'And they're from Shakespeare to his son,'
Henry says.

30
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:44,000
'Shakespeare!'

31
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:54,970
'Yes.' Henry smiles. 'Shakespeare. The old
lady telephoned Professor Barton, and the

32
00:03:54,970 --> 00:04:04,099
Professor visited her. They talked about the
letters and she said, "I want to give them

33
00:04:04,099 --> 00:04:11,959
to the British Museum in London. Can you do
that for me?"'

34
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:14,870
'And Professor Barton said yes?'

35
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:16,190
'That's right.'

36
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:21,919
'Where are the letters now?' Marcel asks.

37
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:31,090
'In the professor's flat. He's going to give
them to the British Museum tomorrow morning

38
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:41,940
at ten o'clock. A lot of journalists and TV
people are going to be there.'

39
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:48,350
Suddenly there's a big BANG! and then a long
WHIZZZ!

40
00:04:48,350 --> 00:05:03,000
'What's that noise?' Marcel asks. He goes
to the window. Then he remembers. 'Oh - fireworks.

41
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:14,060
Of course, it's the 5th of November - your
"Guy Fawkes Day".'

42
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:21,610
Then a man walks down the steps from 42 Old
Wilton Street.

43
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:28,900
Marcel looks at him. 'Is that Professor Barton?'
he asks.

44
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:32,280
'Yes,' Henry answers.

45
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,710
'He always goes to the cinema on Tuesday evenings.'

46
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:40,460
'Aha!' Marcel says.

47
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:49,199
'Why do you say "Aha!"?' Henry looks at his
French friend.

48
00:05:49,199 --> 00:06:02,650
Then suddenly he understands. 'Oh, you want
to look at the Shakespeare letters.' He smiles.

49
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:07,990
'OK. Why not?'

50
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:16,040
After tea, the two mice visit Professor Barton's
flat. There's a small hole near the front

51
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:20,080
door. Henry stops in front of it.

52
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:26,520
'Here we are,' he says. 'Do you want to go
in first?'

53
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:33,919
'No, no. After you,' Marcel says.

54
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:45,490
At 5.55 they're in the professor's flat. It's
very big, with a lot of old chairs and books.

55
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:50,009
There are some beautiful pictures, too.

56
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:54,319
'Come with me,' Henry says.

57
00:06:54,319 --> 00:07:04,830
He walks across the floor. Then he starts
to climb a very tall bookcase. Marcel is behind

58
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:19,120
him. They go up and up and up for a long time.
Then Marcel sits on Charles Dickens's book,

59
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:26,100
Little Dorrit. He can hear a lot of fireworks
in the street.

60
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:37,139
'BANG! BANG! BANG!' they go. 'WHEEE! POW!
WHOOSH!'

61
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:47,419
There's a small, white button in the bookcase.
Henry smiles at Marcel, and presses it. Suddenly,

62
00:07:47,419 --> 00:07:50,800
some of the books start to move.

63
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:59,160
'Why are they moving?' Marcel says. Then he
understands.

64
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:07,650
'Ah, I understand. There's a safe.'

65
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:17,550
'Yes,' Henry says. 'Now, you stay here. I'm
going to open it.'

66
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:25,660
He takes some blue paper from his jeans. Then
he climbs down to the safe. There are some

67
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:47,019
numbers on the paper. He starts to read them.
'55 - 14 - 62 - 29 - 8. Yes, that's right.'

68
00:08:47,019 --> 00:08:57,420
After that, he puts his hands on the safe
and moves the dial to the left. '55,' he says.

69
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:09,410
Then he moves the dial to the right. '14.'
Suddenly there's a very, very big BANG!!!

70
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:17,589
'Wow!' Marcel says. 'That was a big firework.'

71
00:09:17,589 --> 00:09:32,689
Henry doesn't stop. '62,' he says. '29. And...!'
He moves the dial again. '... 8. There - that's

72
00:09:32,689 --> 00:09:42,160
it.' He smiles at Marcel and opens the safe.
But then suddenly his mouth falls open.

73
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,230
'Oh no!' he says.

74
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:56,699
'What's wrong?' Marcel asks. 'They're not
here,' Henry says. 'The Shakespeare letters.

75
00:09:56,699 --> 00:10:00,480
They're not here!'

76
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:08,529
Marcel climbs down the bookcase and looks.
His friend is right. The letters aren't in

77
00:10:08,529 --> 00:10:13,269
the safe, 'But that's not all.'

78
00:10:13,269 --> 00:10:20,230
There's a big hole at the back of the safe,
and a lot of smoke, too.

79
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:30,309
Marcel looks at Henry. Henry looks at Marcel.
Then they climb into the safe.

80
00:10:30,309 --> 00:10:40,549
'Look,' Marcel says. He can see a room in
number 40 Old Wilton Street. He can see a

81
00:10:40,549 --> 00:10:50,720
person, too - a tall woman in a red dress.
She's sitting at a table and talking on the

82
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,750
telephone.

83
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:55,959
'Do you think...?' Henry starts.

84
00:10:55,959 --> 00:11:02,639
'Ssshh,' Marcel says. The two mice sit and
listen.

85
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:15,110
'That's right,' the woman says. 'I'm going
to New York. Yes, this evening.' She writes

86
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:22,449
on a notepad. 'Thank you.' She puts down the
telephone.

87
00:11:22,449 --> 00:11:25,679
There's a bag on the bed in front of her.

88
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:30,089
In it Marcel can see some letters.

89
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:40,079
The woman closes the bag. After that, she
walks to the door. She opens it, and then

90
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:43,759
closes it behind her.

91
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:54,179
Henry looks at Marcel in the hot, dark safe.
'What are we going to do?' he asks. 'That

92
00:11:54,179 --> 00:11:58,529
woman's got the letters. Let's telephone the
police.'

93
00:11:58,529 --> 00:12:07,170
'No, there isn't time,' Marcel says. 'Do you
know her?'

94
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:10,879
'The woman? No, I don't.'

95
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:14,550
'Who usually lives in that flat?'

96
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:27,019
'Two old women, but they're on holiday in
Spain. Oh Marcel, what are we going to do?'

97
00:12:27,019 --> 00:12:36,629
Marcel looks into the dark flat. 'Come with
me,' he says. He climbs into the old women's

98
00:12:36,629 --> 00:12:51,269
flat. Henry is behind him. The two mice run
across the floor. Then they climb up a table.

99
00:12:51,269 --> 00:13:01,869
On the table, there's a yellow light and a
small, white notepad. Marcel looks at it under

100
00:13:01,869 --> 00:13:02,869
the light.

101
00:13:02,869 --> 00:13:08,709
'What are you doing?' Henry asks.

102
00:13:08,709 --> 00:13:20,930
Marcel doesn't answer. Then he says, 'Aha!
I was right. Can you see?'

103
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:36,699
Henry smiles. 'Yes, I can. Not very well,
but... it says, "Concorde - 7.20".'

104
00:13:36,699 --> 00:13:46,300
Marcel puts down the notepad and looks at
his watch. It's six o'clock. Then he starts

105
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:50,480
to run down the leg of the table.

106
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:58,680
Henry runs down the leg of the table, too.
'Where are we going now?' he asks.

107
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:05,339
'Heathrow Airport, of course,' Marcel says.

108
00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:16,499
At 6.05 the two mice are in Old Wilton Street.
It's dark and cold. They walk quickly to Knightsbridge

109
00:14:16,499 --> 00:14:21,430
station. There are a lot of fireworks. 'BANG!
WHEEE! POP! WHOOSH!' Marcel watches them.

110
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:22,929
Then he remembers the very big BANG!!! in
the professor's flat.

111
00:14:22,929 --> 00:14:24,079
'That was clever,' he thinks. 'Very, very
clever.'

112
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:25,079
There are hundreds of people at Knightsbridge
station. Marcel and Henry run under their

113
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:26,079
legs and bags. Marcel can hear a noise.

114
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:27,079
'Quick, Henry,' he says. 'A train's coming.'

115
00:14:27,079 --> 00:14:28,079
He's right. A train is coming into the station.
A sign on the front of it says, 'Heathrow'.

116
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:29,079
The doors open and the mice get on.

117
00:14:29,079 --> 00:14:30,079
Henry looks at Marcel in the hot, dark safe.
'What are we going to do?' he asks. 'That

118
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:31,079
woman's got the letters. Let's telephone the
police.'

119
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:32,079
'No, there isn't time,' Marcel says. 'Do you
know her?' 'The woman? No, I don't.'

120
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,079
'Who usually lives in that flat?'

121
00:14:33,079 --> 00:14:34,079
'Two old women, but they're on holiday in
Spain. Oh Marcel, what are we going to do?'

122
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:35,079
Marcel looks into the dark flat. 'Come with
me,' he says. He climbs into the old women's

123
00:14:35,079 --> 00:14:37,569
flat. Henry is behind him. The two mice run
across the floor. Then they climb up a table.

124
00:14:37,569 --> 00:14:39,180
On the table there's a yellow light and a
small, white notepad. Marcel looks at it under

125
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,180
the light.

126
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,180
'What are you doing?' Henry asks.

127
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,180
Marcel doesn't answer. Then he says, 'Aha!
I was right. Can you see?'

128
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,180
Henry smiles. 'Yes,

129
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:44,180
I can. Not very well, but... it says,

130
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:45,180
"Concorde - 7.20".'

131
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:46,180
Marcel puts down the notepad and looks at
his watch. It's six o'clock. Then he starts

132
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,180
to run down the leg of the table.

133
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,180
Henry runs down the leg of the table, too.
'Where are we going now?' he asks.

134
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,180
'Heathrow Airport, of course,' Marcel says.

135
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,180
At 6,05 the two mice are in Old Wilton Street.
It's dark and cold. They walk quickly to Knightsbridge

136
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,180
station. There are a lot of fireworks. 'BANG!
WHEEE! POP! WHOOSH!' Marcel watches them.

137
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,180
Then he remembers the very big BANG!!! In
the professor's flat.

138
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:53,180
'That was clever,' he thinks. 'Very, very
clever.'

139
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,180
There are hundreds of people at Knightsbridge
station. Marcel and Henry run under their

140
00:14:54,180 --> 00:15:00,439
legs and bags. Marcel can hear a noise.

141
00:15:00,439 --> 00:15:06,509
'Quick, Henry,' he says. 'A train's coming.'

142
00:15:06,509 --> 00:15:17,329
He's right. A train is coming into the station.
A sign on the front of it says, 'Heathrow'.

143
00:15:17,329 --> 00:15:23,449
The doors open and the mice get on.

144
00:15:23,449 --> 00:15:33,199
There are fifteen stations before Heathrow.
Every time, the train stops. Henry says, 'Quick,

145
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:44,799
quick - what are we waiting for?' Then the
doors close and the train starts again.

146
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:56,949
At Heathrow, the mice get off. Marcel looks
left and right. 'Where do we go now?' he asks.

147
00:15:56,949 --> 00:16:04,730
'I don't know,' Henry says. He looks left
and right, too.

148
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:11,790
There are a lot of signs. Then suddenly Henry
smiles.

149
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:18,660
'Marcel, look! That blue sign says "Concorde".'

150
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:29,389
'Good,' Marcel says. He looks at his watch.
It's 7.10. 'Let's go,' he says.

151
00:16:29,389 --> 00:16:41,420
The mice start to run again. 'Marcel,' Henry
says, 'what are we going to do? OK, we find

152
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:49,730
the woman... but then what do we do? How do
we get the letters back?'

153
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:56,779
Marcel smiles. 'Wait and see,' he says.

154
00:16:56,779 --> 00:17:06,130
They come to a door. It says, 'CONCORDE',
but it's closed. Henry and Marcel stop in

155
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:07,709
front of it.

156
00:17:07,709 --> 00:17:12,360
'Oh no,' says Henry.

157
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:22,100
But then two men with big bags open the door
and go in. The mice go in, too.

158
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:31,899
'Good,' Marcel says. He looks at the people
in the room. 'Now... can you see her?'

159
00:17:31,899 --> 00:17:37,399
'No, I can't,' Henry says.

160
00:17:37,399 --> 00:17:43,529
Marcel smiles. 'I can,' he says.

161
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:44,630
'Where?'

162
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:48,640
'There. In front of us.'

163
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:56,580
Henry looks. Marcel is right. The American
woman is sitting on a chair and listening

164
00:17:56,580 --> 00:18:04,830
to her Walkman. She's reading a newspaper,
too. Her bag is on the floor,

165
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:15,201
'OK - let's go,' Marcel says. He takes a small
knife from his coat. 'Walk behind me, Henry

166
00:18:15,201 --> 00:18:20,049
- but be very, very quiet.'

167
00:18:20,049 --> 00:18:29,860
He starts to walk across the room. Henry walks
behind his friend. 'Marcel's a detective,'

168
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:39,671
he thinks. 'It's going to be OK. He knows
his job. He does this every day. Yes... it's

169
00:18:39,671 --> 00:18:49,409
- going - to be - O - K.'

170
00:18:49,409 --> 00:19:00,130
Marcel stops in front of the American woman's
bag. He looks at Henry. 'Ssshh,' he says.

171
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:07,300
'Wait here.' Then he climbs up the bag.

172
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:17,289
After a short time, he starts to make a hole
in it with his knife. Henry watches. His mouth

173
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:27,110
is open. He looks at the American woman. She's
listening to music and reading. She doesn't

174
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:29,779
look down.

175
00:19:29,779 --> 00:19:40,549
Marcel climbs into the bag. It's dark. He
closes his eyes and opens them again. Now

176
00:19:40,549 --> 00:19:53,740
he can see some jeans a radio - some books.
Then suddenly he sees the Shakespeare letters.

177
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:57,750
'Good,' he thinks.

178
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:06,789
He puts the letters on his back and starts
to climb down again. Henry sees him and smiles.

179
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:12,740
But then the mice hear a noise.

180
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:16,889
'Bing bong!'

181
00:20:16,889 --> 00:20:26,139
The American woman looks at her watch. Then
she takes off her Walkman and starts to put

182
00:20:26,139 --> 00:20:29,130
it in her bag.

183
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:38,419
'Hey!' she says. 'What...? Two mice! What's
this?'

184
00:20:38,419 --> 00:20:49,389
'Quick, Henry - catch!' Marcel says. He gives
the letters to Henry. Then he climbs down

185
00:20:49,389 --> 00:20:58,779
the bag. The mice run very quickly with the
Shakespeare letters. They can hear the American

186
00:20:58,779 --> 00:21:05,389
woman behind them. She's running very quickly,
too.

187
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:17,130
The door is open. A man is coming in. He's
fat and he has two bags. The mice run under

188
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:29,030
his legs. Then Marcel hears a big noise! He
looks behind him. The American woman is on

189
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:33,980
the floor, and the man is talking to her.

190
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:39,899
'Sorry,' he says. 'Are you OK?'

191
00:21:39,899 --> 00:21:48,720
The woman stands up. 'No!' she says. Then
she looks for the mice, but she can't see

192
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,549
them.

193
00:21:52,549 --> 00:22:01,380
At nine o'clock Marcel and Henry are back
at Professor Barton's flat in Old Wilton Street.

194
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:11,789
They're very happy. Marcel is sitting on the
table. The Shakespeare letters are in front

195
00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:24,440
of him. He's reading them. Henry is standing
at the window. He's watching the fireworks.

196
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:33,299
Suddenly he sees a man in a brown coat. It's
Professor Barton. He's coming home.

197
00:22:33,299 --> 00:22:43,250
The professor is smiling. Then he walks into
his flat and suddenly he stops smiling. Marcel

198
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:49,940
and Henry are standing behind a chair. They
watch him.

199
00:22:49,940 --> 00:23:01,080
He goes to the safe. It's open. He looks in
it and says, 'Oh no!'

200
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:10,610
Then he sees the Shakespeare letters on the
table. 'But...' He puts one hand on his head.

201
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:21,029
'I don't understand.' He looks at the safe.
Then he looks at the letters - and then he

202
00:23:21,029 --> 00:23:29,379
looks at the safe again. 'Why are the letters
here?' he says.

203
00:23:29,379 --> 00:23:34,679
'When...? How...? I don't understand.'

204
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:46,320
In the morning, Henry and Marcel go to the
British Museum. It's a cold day, and it's

205
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,450
raining.

206
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:56,179
In the museum, there are a lot of journalists
and TV people. They're waiting for Professor

207
00:23:56,179 --> 00:23:58,379
Barton.

208
00:23:58,379 --> 00:24:01,170
He arrives at ten o'clock.

209
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:06,580
'Good morning,' he says to them.

210
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:13,789
He starts to talk about the Shakespeare letters.
Then he gives the letters to a man from the

211
00:24:13,789 --> 00:24:15,320
museum.

212
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:21,970
'Thank you very much, Professor,' the man
says.

213
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:28,380
Henry and Marcel are standing at the back
of the room. Henry smiles at his French friend.

214
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:29,380
'And thank you, Marcel,' he says.

215
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:29,382
- THE END -
