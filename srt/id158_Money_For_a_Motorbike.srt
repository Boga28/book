CHAPTER ONE
Invaders

2
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:23,089
It was the month of June and the weather was
beautiful.

3
00:00:23,089 --> 00:00:25,109
Stuart left school.

4
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:26,589
He was on holiday.

5
00:00:26,589 --> 00:00:28,560
But he was not happy.

6
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,970
He did not have a motorbike.

7
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:34,460
Stuart was seventeen years old.

8
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:38,890
He left school, but he did not start work.

9
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:44,100
All his mates started work immediately, but
Stuart did not want to work.

10
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,460
He wanted a long holiday and he needed a motorbike.

11
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:53,880
Stuart lived in Leeds - a big city in the
North of England.

12
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:58,530
Leeds is a busy city - full of offices, shops
and factories.

13
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:01,260
It's not a good place for a holiday.

14
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:06,240
Martin, a friend of Stuart's, worked in a
garage.

15
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,400
Martin had a bike for sale.

16
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,920
It was a beauty - a Japanese Suzuki.

17
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:19,200
Martin wanted 350 pounds for the bike, but
Stuart did not have 350 pounds.

18
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,330
He didn't have any money.

19
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:25,470
Stuart went and looked at the bike every day.

20
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:27,520
It was a beauty.

21
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,440
He wanted to buy it.

22
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:34,170
'Where can I find 350 pounds?'

23
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:37,700
Stuart asked himself.

24
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:40,920
Stuart left the garage and walked back home.

25
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,740
His house was in Blenheim Street, near the
university.

26
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:48,990
There were lots of old, empty houses in Blenheim
Street.

27
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:52,729
The university was one of the biggest in England.

28
00:01:52,729 --> 00:01:56,530
The university often bought land and buildings.

29
00:01:56,530 --> 00:02:01,869
Most of the old houses in Blenheim Street
belonged to the university.

30
00:02:01,869 --> 00:02:05,510
Some of these houses had been empty for years.

31
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:07,970
Stuart often searched through them.

32
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:11,390
Sometimes he found old books and gramophone
records.

33
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:19,010
'One day,' he told himself, 'I'll find something
valuable.'

34
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:22,620
There was a large house at the corner of Blenheim
Street.

35
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:27,540
Its owner - a rich, old woman - had died a
few days ago.

36
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:31,180
The university bought the house immediately.

37
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:33,209
Now the house was empty.

38
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:38,790
There was wood across the front door and the
windows were broken.

39
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:41,340
Someone looked out of a window.

40
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,760
It was a man of about twenty.

41
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,100
He had long hair and was wearing a headband.

42
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,750
He looked strange.

43
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:52,100
He was a squatter.

44
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:57,380
Squatters live in old, empty houses and they
don't pay any rent.

45
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:59,980
The stranger waved to Stuart.

46
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,880
He wanted to speak to Stuart.

47
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,980
'What does he want?'

48
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,770
Stuart asked himself.

49
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,000
"Hi!"

50
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,230
"Hello."

51
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:14,130
"Like to help me?"

52
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:15,360
"Ok."

53
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,849
"Watch this house."

54
00:03:17,849 --> 00:03:19,290
"How long?"

55
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:21,450
"Half an hour."

56
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:22,450
"Ok."

57
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:23,620
"I'm Stuart."

58
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,780
"My name's Frank."

59
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:28,670
"I'll go and get my things."

60
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:32,069
"Are you going to squat here Frank?"

61
00:03:32,069 --> 00:03:34,910
"Yes, don't let else in."

62
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,519
"I'll be back soon."

63
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:38,860
"Ok.

64
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:43,550
See you."

65
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:46,450
Frank walked off slowly down the street.

66
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:50,950
His head was bent forward and he was looking
down at the pavement.

67
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:55,209
He was about twenty, but he looked much older.

68
00:03:55,209 --> 00:03:59,599
Frank went round the corner and Stuart turned
towards the house.

69
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:02,050
It looked interesting.

70
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:05,630
The window was low - quite near the ground.

71
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:08,020
The street was empty.

72
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:13,600
Stuart put one leg over the window sill and
looked inside.

73
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,519
Outside the sun was shining brightly.

74
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:20,090
Inside the house, it was dark.

75
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:23,340
Stuart stood for a few moments and waited.

76
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:26,990
Slowly the inside of the room became clearer.

77
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:29,570
There was a calendar on the wall.

78
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:33,740
Lots of old newspapers were lying around on
the floor.

79
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:36,610
There was a mattress against the far wall.

80
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,210
It looked new.

81
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:41,930
Stuart looked up and down the street.

82
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:44,080
There was no one around.

83
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:49,910
He quickly climbed into the room.

84
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:53,699
Stuart walked to the middle of the room and
kicked away the old newspapers.

85
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:56,510
There was nothing underneath them.

86
00:04:56,510 --> 00:05:02,000
There was no carpet and the floorboards were
covered with dirt.

87
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,840
Stuart took the calendar down from the wall.

88
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:08,000
It was an old one - five years old.

89
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,490
No one had changed it for five years.

90
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:13,410
Then Stuart remembered.

91
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:18,190
The owner of the house - the old woman - had
been ill for a long time.

92
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:23,090
She hadn't got out of her bed for five years.

93
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:26,650
The mattress was leaning against the far wall.

94
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:29,949
Stuart went over and looked at it carefully.

95
00:05:29,949 --> 00:05:32,919
It was a good mattress.

96
00:05:32,919 --> 00:05:37,570
Stuart picked up the mattress and turned it
over carefully.

97
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:43,460
There was some stitching along one side - about
ten centimetres long.

98
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:49,919
Stuart held the mattress between his knees
and took out a small knife.

99
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:54,790
Stuart cut the stitches carefully and then
put his hand in the hole.

100
00:05:54,790 --> 00:06:00,350
He felt a bundle of newspapers and pulled
it out.

101
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:05,020
He quickly unwrapped it.

102
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:14,350
Inside the bundle of newspapers there were
some banknotes.

103
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:16,910
Suddenly Stuart heard a voice.

104
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:19,330
It was Frank.

105
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:24,340
'Hey - Stuart - where are you?'

106
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:26,680
Frank was shouting.

107
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:32,570
Stuart quickly wrapped up the money inside
the newspapers.

108
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:35,990
He held the bundle behind his back.

109
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:40,280
'I'm in here, Frank,' he shouted.

110
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:43,220
Frank came up to the window and looked into
the room.

111
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:46,570
'What are you doing in there?'

112
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:47,900
Frank asked.

113
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:50,639
'Nothing,' replied Stuart.

114
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,580
'I'm looking around.'

115
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:57,770
Frank climbed into the room and came closer
to Stuart.

116
00:06:57,770 --> 00:06:59,560
Stuart moved to the wall.

117
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:04,000
He held the bundle of newspapers behind his
back.

118
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,410
Frank looked round the room.

119
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:10,389
He didn't see Stuart's knife on the floor.

120
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:14,819
'You haven't taken anything, have you?' asked
Frank.

121
00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:19,310
'I haven't taken anything of yours,' replied
Stuart.

122
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:23,870
'You've moved this mattress,' said Frank.

123
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:27,750
Frank picked up the mattress and turned it
over carefully.

124
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:30,509
Then he saw the hole in the side.

125
00:07:30,509 --> 00:07:33,370
"You've this mattress."

126
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:34,980
"It was stitched."

127
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:38,000
"Is this your knife?"

128
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
"Yes."

129
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,500
"What were you doing?"

130
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,730
"Nothing."

131
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:45,680
"You found something."

132
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,240
"I didn't."

133
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:51,120
"What's that in your hand?"

134
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,120
"Where?"

135
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,229
"Behind your back."

136
00:07:54,229 --> 00:07:55,229
"Nothing."

137
00:07:55,229 --> 00:07:57,210
"You've got something."

138
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:59,789
"Some old newspapers."

139
00:07:59,789 --> 00:08:02,630
"Hand them over."

140
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:06,080
"They're mine."

141
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,979
Stuart remembered the motorbike.

142
00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:09,690
He needed the money.

143
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:10,690
He was going to keep it.

144
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:14,970
It was his money, not Frank's.

145
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:17,990
Frank was holding Stuart's knife in his hand.

146
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:20,580
He came nearer to Stuart.

147
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:25,550
'Give me those newspapers,' he said again.

148
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:27,460
Stuart had an idea.

149
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:30,860
'There's something else in the mattress,'
he said to Frank.

150
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:33,620
'There was something under the newspapers.

151
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:36,219
It's still there.'

152
00:08:36,219 --> 00:08:38,750
Frank looked at Stuart for a few moments.

153
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:41,469
He didn't believe him at first.

154
00:08:41,469 --> 00:08:44,819
'Look and see,' said Stuart.

155
00:08:44,819 --> 00:08:47,239
Frank put the knife down on the floor.

156
00:08:47,239 --> 00:08:52,309
He picked up the mattress and put his hand
deep in the hole.

157
00:08:52,309 --> 00:08:54,240
Stuart did not wait for a moment.

158
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:59,629
He turned and jumped out through the window
into the street.

159
00:08:59,629 --> 00:09:01,750
He ran quickly.

160
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,480
There was a turning on the right.

161
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,600
Stuart ran round the corner.

162
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,750
He heard a shout behind him.

163
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:11,110
It was Frank.

164
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:15,230
Round the corner, there was another old, empty
house.

165
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:18,190
It had a large garden on one side.

166
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:21,050
Thick bushes had grown all over the garden.

167
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:24,430
Stuart jumped over the low wall.

168
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:29,639
He ran for a few metres and then hid under
some bushes.

169
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:32,749
Stuart heard more shouting and footsteps.

170
00:09:32,749 --> 00:09:37,629
The footsteps became louder, then they stopped.

171
00:09:37,629 --> 00:09:39,779
Stuart waited silently.

172
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:42,220
He did not breathe.

173
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:45,989
Then the footsteps started once again.

174
00:09:45,989 --> 00:09:51,980
Stuart laughed quietly to himself.

175
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:54,660
Frank had quickly picked up Stuart's knife.

176
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:57,869
He jumped out of the window after him.

177
00:09:57,869 --> 00:09:59,329
Frank saw Stuart.

178
00:09:59,329 --> 00:10:01,959
He was running round the corner.

179
00:10:01,959 --> 00:10:04,819
Frank ran after him and turned the corner.

180
00:10:04,819 --> 00:10:07,660
But the street was empty.

181
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:11,319
Frank stopped for a few moments and looked
around.

182
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:14,449
He noticed the old garden.

183
00:10:14,449 --> 00:10:18,769
'Perhaps he's in there,' thought Frank.

184
00:10:18,769 --> 00:10:21,660
But everything in the garden was quiet.

185
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,700
Frank saw nothing.

186
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:27,509
There was another corner farther down the
street.

187
00:10:27,509 --> 00:10:29,769
Frank started running again.

188
00:10:29,769 --> 00:10:34,029
He was still holding Stuart's knife.

189
00:10:34,029 --> 00:10:35,339
Stuart was happy.

190
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:39,049
He had escaped from Frank with the money.

191
00:10:39,049 --> 00:10:43,329
Stuart sat up under the bushes and opened
out the newspapers.

192
00:10:43,329 --> 00:10:47,029
The banknotes were wrapped tightly together.

193
00:10:47,029 --> 00:10:51,279
Stuart unwrapped them and counted them carefully.

194
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:58,360
'Ten, twenty, thirty...

195
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:07,519
three hundred and twenty, three hundred and
twenty-five.'

196
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,339
Stuart had found 325 pounds.

197
00:11:09,339 --> 00:11:17,190
And Martin wanted 350 pounds for his motorbike.

198
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:22,350
It was cool in the garden and Stuart lay back
under the bushes.

199
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:25,999
I'll wait here for half an hour, thought Stuart.

200
00:11:25,999 --> 00:11:31,119
Then I'll go to Martin.

201
00:11:31,119 --> 00:11:33,209
It was now nearly twelve o'clock.

202
00:11:33,209 --> 00:11:34,980
The day was getting much hotter.

203
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:39,449
A police car was parked in a side street.

204
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:41,649
There were two policemen in the car.

205
00:11:41,649 --> 00:11:46,629
The sergeant - a fat, round-faced man - was
half asleep.

206
00:11:46,629 --> 00:11:49,019
The other policeman was younger and taller.

207
00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:50,860
He was a constable.

208
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:54,649
Suddenly, the constable sat up.

209
00:11:54,649 --> 00:11:56,610
He had seen something strange.

210
00:11:56,610 --> 00:12:00,549
'Wake up, sergeant,' he shouted.

211
00:12:00,549 --> 00:12:02,670
'Look over there.'

212
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:03,700
'Where?

213
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:07,959
What?' asked the sergeant still half asleep.

214
00:12:07,959 --> 00:12:12,850
'Over there - someone's running with a knife,'
replied the constable.

215
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:15,060
'The man's gone mad.

216
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,629
It's this heat.'

217
00:12:16,629 --> 00:12:22,049
'Quick - get out and catch him,' said the
sergeant.

218
00:12:22,049 --> 00:12:25,410
The two policemen jumped out of their car.

219
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:27,199
Frank saw the policemen.

220
00:12:27,199 --> 00:12:30,769
He threw Stuart's knife away and started to
run.

221
00:12:30,769 --> 00:12:35,459
The constable soon caught him and held his
arm tightly.

222
00:12:35,459 --> 00:12:38,980
The sergeant found the knife in some long
grass.

223
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:42,410
The constable took Frank towards the police
car.

224
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:44,160
The sergeant came up to them.

225
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,980
He was holding the knife.

226
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:51,949
'Oh - it's you,' the sergeant said to Frank.

227
00:12:51,949 --> 00:12:54,850
"What's going on, Frank?"

228
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:56,949
"I'm looking for a guy."

229
00:12:56,949 --> 00:12:59,089
"With a knife?"

230
00:12:59,089 --> 00:13:00,509
"What guy?"

231
00:13:00,509 --> 00:13:02,939
"He's stolen my money."

232
00:13:02,939 --> 00:13:04,540
"What money?'

233
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:06,389
"How much money?"

234
00:13:06,389 --> 00:13:09,290
"I don't know - a lot."

235
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:11,249
"You don't know!"

236
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:13,519
"Where did you get it?"

237
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:16,339
"In an old house."

238
00:13:16,339 --> 00:13:18,970
"Come on - into the car."

239
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:32,369
'Where are you taking me?' asked Frank.

240
00:13:32,369 --> 00:13:36,529
'To the police station,' replied the constable.

241
00:13:36,529 --> 00:13:38,309
'But I haven't done anything.

242
00:13:38,309 --> 00:13:39,500
The money was mine.

243
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,389
That guy took it.

244
00:13:41,389 --> 00:13:42,870
What's his name?

245
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:43,959
Stuart...

246
00:13:43,959 --> 00:13:45,079
Stuart took it.'

247
00:13:45,079 --> 00:13:47,879
'Who's Stuart?' asked the constable.

248
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:51,769
'I met him in an old house,' replied Frank.

249
00:13:51,769 --> 00:13:55,149
'Where you found the money?' asked the sergeant.

250
00:13:55,149 --> 00:14:00,209
'Yes, I found it inside a mattress,' said
Frank.

251
00:14:00,209 --> 00:14:02,879
'Who's got the money now?' asked the sergeant.

252
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:04,800
'That guy - Stuart.

253
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,500
He ran away with it.'

254
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:17,480
'So, now we have to find Stuart,' said the
constable.

255
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:20,639
Stuart waited in the garden for half an hour.

256
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,369
It was getting hotter.

257
00:14:22,369 --> 00:14:25,279
It was nearly twelve o'clock.

258
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:28,939
I'll have to move now, thought Stuart.

259
00:14:28,939 --> 00:14:32,929
Martin goes for his lunch at half past twelve.

260
00:14:32,929 --> 00:14:35,709
Stuart looked out carefully from the bushes.

261
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:37,850
The garden was empty.

262
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:40,850
He hurried out of the garden onto the street.

263
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:44,100
He walked towards Martin's garage.

264
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,999
Stuart did not see the police car.

265
00:14:46,999 --> 00:14:50,970
It stopped outside the garden a few moments
later.

266
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:54,290
'Look in this garden,' Frank told the policemen.

267
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:55,529
'Perhaps he's hiding in here.'

268
00:14:55,529 --> 00:15:00,139
"Hi, Martin."

269
00:15:00,139 --> 00:15:04,759
"Hello Stuart."

270
00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:09,889
"How much for the bike?"

271
00:15:09,889 --> 00:15:11,459
"350 pounds."

272
00:15:11,459 --> 00:15:13,810
"I want it."

273
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:15,759
"How much for me?

274
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:18,079
"Still 350 pounds."

275
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:21,180
"Have you any money?

276
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:22,180
"Yes."

277
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:23,510
"How much?"

278
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:25,060
"300 pounds."

279
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:26,850
"That's not enough."

280
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:30,629
"325 pounds?"

281
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:33,040
"Ok, she's yours."

282
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:37,320
"Great.

283
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:41,600
Thanks."

284
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,559
The policemen got out of the car.

285
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:46,759
Frank got out too.

286
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:49,569
The constable held his arm tightly.

287
00:15:49,569 --> 00:15:52,149
The sergeant went into the garden.

288
00:15:52,149 --> 00:15:54,439
He looked around for some time.

289
00:15:54,439 --> 00:15:56,179
Then he came back.

290
00:15:56,179 --> 00:15:59,759
He was holding a bundle of newspapers.

291
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,579
'There's no one there,' the sergeant said.

292
00:16:02,579 --> 00:16:05,169
'But I found these old newspapers.'

293
00:16:05,169 --> 00:16:07,570
'That's them,' shouted Frank.

294
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:11,350
'Something was wrapped in those newspapers.'

295
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:14,660
Just then a motorbike drove up towards the
police car.

296
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:17,829
'That's him,' shouted Frank excitedly.

297
00:16:17,829 --> 00:16:19,499
'That's the guy.

298
00:16:19,499 --> 00:16:23,239
He's bought a motorbike with my money.'

299
00:16:23,239 --> 00:16:28,779
'Stop,' the sergeant called to Stuart.

300
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:31,730
'Stop.'

301
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:33,359
Stuart did not see Frank.

302
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:36,470
'What do the police want?'

303
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:37,699
Stuart asked himself.

304
00:16:37,699 --> 00:16:39,889
'I haven't done anything wrong.

305
00:16:39,889 --> 00:16:43,319
I'm driving correctly.'

306
00:16:43,319 --> 00:16:46,179
Stuart stopped the bike by the side of the
road.

307
00:16:46,179 --> 00:16:47,639
He took off his helmet.

308
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:50,569
'Is that bike yours?'

309
00:16:50,569 --> 00:16:52,110
the sergeant asked him.

310
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:55,420
'Yes, it's mine,' replied Stuart.

311
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:59,109
'I bought it at the garage down the road.'

312
00:16:59,109 --> 00:17:00,850
Then Stuart saw Frank.

313
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:04,370
'What have you told these cops?'

314
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:06,919
Stuart shouted angrily at Frank.

315
00:17:06,919 --> 00:17:12,880
'We'll all go to this garage,' said the sergeant.

316
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:19,750
They all walked back to Martin's garage.

317
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:23,260
A big, black cloud now covered the sun.

318
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:25,260
It was beginning to rain.

319
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:32,889
'So, this lad paid you 325 pounds for this
bike,' the sergeant said to Martin.

320
00:17:32,889 --> 00:17:34,070
Martin agreed.

321
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:37,889
'And where did you get this money?'

322
00:17:37,889 --> 00:17:39,760
the sergeant asked Stuart.

323
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,490
'I found it,' replied Stuart.

324
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:44,480
'I found it in a mattress.

325
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,309
It was in an empty house.'

326
00:17:47,309 --> 00:17:49,870
The sergeant took the money from Martin.

327
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:53,220
'We'll look after this money,' he said.

328
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:55,529
'You two can go now.'

329
00:17:55,529 --> 00:17:58,140
'It's my money,' shouted Frank.

330
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:04,830
'Do you want to come to the police station
with us?' asked the constable.

331
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:07,930
Frank walked away, still shouting.

332
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:11,990
'I'm sorry,' Martin said to Stuart.

333
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:13,870
'It's my bike again.'

334
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:16,779
'Not for long,' replied Stuart.

335
00:18:16,779 --> 00:18:21,750
'What do you mean?' asked the sergeant.

336
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:25,410
'It has started to rain now,' replied Stuart.

337
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:27,340
'I don't want a holiday.

338
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:30,070
I'm going to get a job.

339
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:41,669
I'm going to save another 325 pounds and buy
that bike.'

340
00:18:41,669 --> 00:18:50,740
- THE END -
