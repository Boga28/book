1
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:15,039
Marrying a man who already has children makes
you a stepmother, a difficult part to play

2
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:16,890
in a family.

3
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:21,900
And stepmothers in stories are often mean
and unkind to their stepchildren.

4
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:28,119
Lakshman, who is nine, knows this very well.

5
00:00:28,119 --> 00:00:30,660
He never wanted a stepmother.

6
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,160
Why ever did his father marry her?

7
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,559
Maybe if he is horrible to her, she will go
away again...

8
00:00:38,559 --> 00:01:05,360
Lakshman ran his hand over the surface of
the cupboard and breathed in the pleasant

9
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,880
smell of newly cut wood.

10
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:19,920
An almirah, with four doors, two above and
two below, and a shiny key in each one - what

11
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,270
use was an almirah to a baby!

12
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:29,600
Nobody ever made almirahs with four doors!

13
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,189
Carefully he turned the keys to look inside.

14
00:01:34,189 --> 00:01:40,790
In one half, there was a place to hang clothes
- small clothes.

15
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:43,829
The other half had narrow shelves.

16
00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:47,820
Underneath, there were two long, wide shelves.

17
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:55,179
Somebody - she, he supposed - had already
put some toys there, baby things, plastic

18
00:01:55,179 --> 00:02:00,939
cups that fit into each other, little wooden
bricks, and coloured balls.

19
00:02:00,939 --> 00:02:04,240
Angrily he banged the doors shut.

20
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,740
What a complete waste!

21
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:14,590
In his bare feet he walked down the stairs
to the back of the house, to the kitchen area.

22
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:19,720
The old Amme was squatting on the floor, cutting
up vegetables for the meal.

23
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:27,700
A row of pots and pans stood on the floor,
and Kandy, the Alsatian dog, was sleeping

24
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:34,040
peacefully beside them, his tail occasionally
waving away the flies.

25
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:41,819
Both Lakshman and the Amme knew this was against
the rules - the rules the new woman had made

26
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:44,569
after she took control of the house.

27
00:02:44,569 --> 00:02:50,769
But they understood each other, the old cook
and the boy.

28
00:02:50,769 --> 00:02:55,000
He squatted down opposite her, watching her.

29
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,849
Although he was nine he was small for his
age - small, but strong.

30
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:08,200
He wore an old shirt and a too-small pair
of washed-out blue trousers.

31
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:12,760
For some time he watched the Amme in silence.

32
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:21,250
Then, in his rather high little-boy's voice,
he asked, 'Where is the bloody woman?'

33
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:24,320
The Amme did not stop her cutting.

34
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:28,909
She said calmly, 'She's getting dressed to
go out.

35
00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:31,930
She wants you to change and go with her.

36
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:35,530
To buy new shoes for school.'

37
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:38,630
The boy sighed.

38
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:42,970
He picked up a piece of sugarcane and began
to suck it noisily.

39
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:45,569
That was really too bad!

40
00:03:45,569 --> 00:03:52,120
Did she really think he'd go out with her,
walk in the street where all his friends would

41
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,540
see him?

42
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:58,150
True, his father had said she would help him
and look after him.

43
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:04,060
But that did not mean she could give him orders,
or that he had to do what she wanted.

44
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:11,730
Why, he wouldn't go with her for anything
- not even if she offered him a bicycle.

45
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:15,709
Lakshman had been saving for a bicycle for
some time.

46
00:04:15,709 --> 00:04:22,140
His weekly money from his father, gifts from
aunts and uncles and grandparents, all this

47
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:24,730
was carefully saved.

48
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:32,190
In fact Lakshman lived for the day when there
would be enough for that bicycle.

49
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:38,330
But dislike of his stepmother was so great
that he could not even imagine himself accepting

50
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:41,430
a bicycle from her.

51
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:47,650
He bit off a piece of sugarcane and said crossly,
'I am not going out with her to buy a pair

52
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:50,810
of shoes.'

53
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:53,949
It was hot in the kitchen.

54
00:04:53,949 --> 00:04:59,620
The Amme lifted a corner of the cotton cloth
she was wearing wrapped round her like a skirt,

55
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:04,220
and wiped the sweat from her face and neck.

56
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:10,000
At that moment Lakshman's stepmother appeared
in the doorway.

57
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,880
Her eyes took in the scene and narrowed angrily.

58
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:22,280
She raised her voice and said, 'Amme, I have
told you again and again not to cut vegetables

59
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:28,500
on the floor,' and then to Lakshman, 'Lakshman,
go and change your clothes.

60
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:32,860
I want to take you out to buy a pair of shoes.'

61
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:36,020
Neither Amme nor the child moved.

62
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:43,669
The Amme began to cut vegetables again, with
great concentration.

63
00:05:43,669 --> 00:05:46,690
Lakshman looked quickly at his stepmother.

64
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:48,880
The she-devil.

65
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,030
Whatever had made his father marry her?

66
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:57,949
He said, 'Amme doesn't understand English.

67
00:05:57,949 --> 00:06:01,139
And I don't want to go out.

68
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:04,550
You buy the shoes for me.'

69
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:08,720
The woman straightened her back and looked
down at him.

70
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:16,120
'If Amme doesn't understand English, why don't
you tell her in Singhalese?

71
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,199
And you say you won't come out with me...

72
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:23,289
Well, I can't buy a pair of shoes unless you
try them on.

73
00:06:23,289 --> 00:06:25,260
So please get ready.

74
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,050
Quickly now.'

75
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:34,570
He turned to the Amme and said in Singhalese,
'That bloody woman says not to cut vegetables

76
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:36,670
on the floor.'

77
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:42,770
Very slowly and heavily the Amme got up from
where she was squatting.

78
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:47,889
She picked up the vegetables and threw them
on the kitchen table.

79
00:06:47,889 --> 00:06:54,440
Then she said to the child, 'Tell her I can't
work for her.

80
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,639
Also I am not well.

81
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,629
I have to go home.'

82
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:04,050
Lakshman repeated in English exactly what
the old cook

83
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:06,419
had said.

84
00:07:06,419 --> 00:07:11,930
The tall one looked from the child to the
old woman a little helplessly, then shrugged

85
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:12,930
her shoulders.

86
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:18,449
'If she is not feeling well, she must go home
and get better.

87
00:07:18,449 --> 00:07:20,350
Meanwhile, you get ready.

88
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:21,350
I am waiting.'

89
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:28,750
He stepped right in front of his stepmother;
he had to bend his head far back in order

90
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:31,389
to see her face.

91
00:07:31,389 --> 00:07:38,160
He collected the spit in his mouth, then walked
slowly and deliberately to the corner of the

92
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:44,599
kitchen where there was a space for washing
vegetables, and spat.

93
00:07:44,599 --> 00:07:49,349
Spitting was the best way to drive away evil
things.

94
00:07:49,349 --> 00:07:50,430
Then he said:

95
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:52,639
'But I told you.

96
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,740
I am not coming.'

97
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,669
She took a deep breath.

98
00:07:58,669 --> 00:08:01,210
'All right.

99
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:05,919
If you are not coming, I am not buying the
shoes.'

100
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:10,740
She turned and walked towards the front door.

101
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:17,430
Lakshman ran after her and shouted so that
it echoed down the road, 'If you don't buy

102
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:27,300
those shoes, I'll - I'll tell all the neighbours
and relations what a mean, hateful, horrible

103
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,960
stepmother you are...'

104
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,130
She didn't even turn her head.

105
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:37,860
All she said was, 'You tell them whatever
you like, Lakshman.

106
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:42,770
But if you want a pair of shoes, you've got
to come and try them on.

107
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:46,040
Or else, no shoes.'

108
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:49,300
He watched her drive off.

109
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:57,070
He was very angry, not because he needed the
shoes so badly, but because he felt she had

110
00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:00,650
won this particular argument.

111
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:06,020
He could hear the men servants talking and
laughing loudly in the kitchen with the Amme,

112
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,940
who was packing her things.

113
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:11,800
They were talking about his stepmother.

114
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:17,570
And suddenly a cold fury rose in him.

115
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:24,540
Why had she come here and upset things, when
everything was running so smoothly before!

116
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:28,040
And now the Amme was leaving...

117
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:31,950
Upstairs the baby began to cry.

118
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:35,880
That was another thing - her baby.

119
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:44,460
All that fuss and bother about him... you
would think nobody had ever had a baby before.

120
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:51,850
And all that nonsense about keeping him clean
and not touching him with dirty fingers!

121
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:54,490
And almirahs!

122
00:09:54,490 --> 00:10:00,900
Almirahs were bought for brides when they
got married, to take to their new husband's

123
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:05,090
house, to keep their saris and jewellery safe.

124
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:11,410
And then he had an idea.

125
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:15,560
Thoughtfully he climbed back up the stairs.

126
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:21,750
There stood the almirah, with its smell of
new wood.

127
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:27,260
Without hesitating he opened the two bottom
doors, which he could easily reach because

128
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:30,020
they were at his height.

129
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:39,800
He took hold of one door and forced it back
further and further until the wood broke and

130
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:45,000
the door fell to the ground with a loud crash.

131
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,220
The second door soon followed the first.

132
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:55,220
To reach the upper two doors, he got a chair
and climbed on it.

133
00:10:55,220 --> 00:11:01,360
It was more difficult this time, but he pushed
as hard as he could, until the third door

134
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:07,110
landed on the ground with an even bigger crash.

135
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:14,040
He waited for a moment to see whether anyone
would come to investigate, but he wasn't really

136
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,110
worried.

137
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:20,350
They - the servants - couldn't stop him.

138
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:22,730
Wasn't he the young master?

139
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:27,080
Anyway, they wouldn't want to stop him.

140
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,390
Not at all.

141
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:32,900
They'd be delighted with the trouble he was
causing the new woman.

142
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:36,290
He smiled nastily.

143
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:39,550
Wouldn't she be wild!

144
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:42,080
He imagined her return.

145
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:45,200
This time she'd really get mad.

146
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:53,150
She'd hit him and scream at him, and then
his father would get rid of her, once and

147
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:55,330
for all.

148
00:11:55,330 --> 00:12:02,210
With this happy thought he turned back to
the almirah, and finally managed to break

149
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:05,320
the fourth door off.

150
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:11,250
Carefully he replaced the chair, and left
the broken doors where they had fallen.

151
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:15,200
Then he decided to play a game in his room.

152
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:21,280
There would be enough time to hide when he
heard the car.

153
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:25,140
She was coming up the stairs.

154
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:30,320
Lakshman was lying flat on the floor of his
room, looking through the narrow space under

155
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,130
his door.

156
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:38,980
He could hear the changing sound of her footsteps
as she came higher and higher, and he held

157
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:43,830
his breath when she finally stopped.

158
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:47,960
She stopped for quite some time.

159
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:52,900
Then she called - not him, but the servant.

160
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:57,720
She asked, 'Who has done this, Somapala?'

161
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:06,730
Somapala, who had not seen the broken almirah
before, gasped and said, 'I don't know.'

162
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:12,760
There was another pause, and she said something
Lakshman couldn't hear.

163
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:16,230
Then she went into her bedroom.

164
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:19,320
That was too much for Lakshman.

165
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,750
After all his hard work...

166
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:29,260
He jumped up from the floor, ran through the
doors, and burst into her room without knocking.

167
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:36,370
She was standing by the mirror examining her
face, and his eyes met hers in the mirror.

168
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:41,830
He screamed, 'You want to know who did it.

169
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:46,570
Well, I did, I did it...'

170
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:54,280
His face was red under the brown skin, and
his eyes very black, shining with the light

171
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,780
of battle.

172
00:13:55,780 --> 00:14:01,980
His arms hung by his sides, his hands tightly
closed.

173
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:04,030
She turned slowly.

174
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:08,950
'You did it, Lakshman?

175
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:10,180
You?'

176
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:14,050
She looked down at him from her great height.

177
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:18,630
Her fingers were playing with the household
keys she was holding.

178
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:22,770
'That's really too bad, Lakshman.

179
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:24,960
Breaking the baby's cupboard.

180
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,111
We had to pay a lot of money for it.'

181
00:14:27,111 --> 00:14:29,580
He almost laughed.

182
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:33,100
The stupid woman!

183
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:36,990
What was the point in breaking something cheap?

184
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:44,200
He waited for her fury to break, preparing
himself for the punishment, looking forward

185
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:47,150
to it almost with pleasure.

186
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:50,890
But it didn't come.

187
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:56,700
She just stood there and looked at him calmly.

188
00:14:56,700 --> 00:15:05,200
Then she said, 'That's really too bad, Lakshman,
I thought you were a sensible sort of boy.'

189
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,280
She sighed.

190
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:12,240
'So now we have to ask the workman to repair
the damage.

191
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,450
Quite an unnecessary bother and cost.'

192
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:19,920
She walked towards the baby's room.

193
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:27,720
Lakshman had a terrible feeling of disappointment,
worse than he had ever experienced before.

194
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:35,390
Wildly he ran after her and asked urgently,
'But aren't you going to punish me?'

195
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:37,980
'Punish you?'

196
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,440
She appeared surprised.

197
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,940
'Punish you?

198
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,450
Oh, no.

199
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:46,210
There's no point in that.

200
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:49,100
Because that's what you want, isn't it?'

201
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,740
She looked him straight in the eye.

202
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,940
'No, Lakshman.

203
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:56,770
I am not going to punish you.

204
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:58,040
Only...'

205
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,990
She hesitated for a moment.

206
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:02,930
'About the repairs.

207
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:05,370
You are going to pay for them, Lakshman.

208
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:08,680
Out of your bicycle money.

209
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:12,250
That's fair, don't you think?'

210
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:20,070
She opened the door of the baby's room, walked
through, and firmly shut it behind her.

211
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:24,080
Lakshman stared at the closed door.

212
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:31,370
The sun was shining outside and little gold
bits of dust were dancing in the sunlight.

213
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:38,940
The blood had left his face, and he stood
there, wide-eyed and silent.

214
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:46,930
Then he walked out of her room, past the four
broken almirah doors on the floor, and down

215
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:49,110
the stairs.

216
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:56,630
His head was bent as he went slowly down,
his old shirt hanging out over the too-small

217
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:59,500
blue trousers.

218
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:03,350
He heard the door of the baby's room opening.

219
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:08,250
The woman was looking down at him from the
top of the stairs, but he pretended not to

220
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:13,060
see, and continued going down without stopping.

221
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:15,630
She said, 'Lakshman?'

222
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:16,910
Pause.

223
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:23,079
'Lakshman - we can come to an arrangement.'

224
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:25,860
He did not look up.

225
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:32,860
But there was no longer any sharpness in her
voice; instead, there was a warm note in it

226
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:36,490
that the child did not fail to notice.

227
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:43,360
She said, 'You help the workman repair the
cupboard, and I'll pay half the cost.

228
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,780
Agreed?'

229
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,850
His eyes were hot with tears.

230
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:52,830
'The bloody woman,' he whispered to himself.

231
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:57,250
'The bloody, bloody woman...'

232
00:17:57,250 --> 00:18:04,400
But he slowed down, and as he reached the
bottom of the stairs, she heard him begin

233
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,400
to whistle.

234
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:19,920
'Agreed,' he shouted, and ran quickly out
of sight.

235
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:25,179
- THE END -
