THE 
ADVENTURES OF BUSTER BEAR

2
00:00:12,299 --> 00:00:15,999
CHAPTER I
BUSTER BEAR GOES FISHING

3
00:00:15,999 --> 00:00:21,590
Buster Bear yawned as he lay on his comfortable
bed of leaves and watched the first early

4
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:27,240
morning sunbeams creeping through the Green
Forest to chase out the Black Shadows.

5
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:33,110
Once more he yawned, and slowly got to his
feet and shook himself.

6
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:39,179
Then he walked over to a big pine-tree, stood
up on his hind legs, reached as high up on

7
00:00:39,179 --> 00:00:45,030
the trunk of the tree as he could, and scratched
the bark with his great claws.

8
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:51,960
After that he yawned until it seemed as if
his jaws would crack, and then sat down to

9
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,280
think what he wanted for breakfast.

10
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,780
While he sat there, trying to make up his
mind what would taste best, he was listening

11
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:06,810
to the sounds that told of the waking of all
the little people who live in the Green Forest.

12
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:10,329
He heard Sammy Jay way off in the distance
screaming,

13
00:01:10,329 --> 00:01:11,329
"Thief!

14
00:01:11,329 --> 00:01:12,460
Thief!" and grinned.

15
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:21,200
"I wonder," thought Buster, "if some one has
stolen Sammy's breakfast, or if he has stolen

16
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,010
the breakfast of some one else.

17
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:26,399
Probably he is the thief himself."

18
00:01:26,399 --> 00:01:31,860
He heard Chatterer the Red Squirrel scolding
as fast as he could make his tongue go and

19
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,530
working himself into a terrible rage.

20
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:41,940
"Must be that Chatterer got out of bed the
wrong way this morning," thought he.

21
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:47,009
He heard Blacky the Crow cawing at the top
of his lungs, and he knew by the sound that

22
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:50,140
Blacky was getting into mischief of some kind.

23
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:54,710
He heard the sweet voices of happy little
singers, and they were good to hear.

24
00:01:54,710 --> 00:02:01,439
But most of all he listened to a merry, low,
silvery laugh that never stopped but went

25
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:06,549
on and on, until he just felt as if he must
laugh too.

26
00:02:06,549 --> 00:02:09,390
It was the voice of the Laughing Brook.

27
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:14,900
And as Buster listened it suddenly came to
him just what he wanted for breakfast.

28
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:22,040
"I'm going fishing," said he in his deep grumbly-rumbly
voice to no one in particular.

29
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:25,200
"Yes, Sir, I'm going fishing.

30
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,220
I want some fat trout for my breakfast."

31
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:34,560
He shuffled along over to the Laughing Brook,
and straight to a little pool of which he

32
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:41,410
knew, and as he drew near he took the greatest
care not to make the teeniest, weeniest bit

33
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:42,410
of noise.

34
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:49,680
Now it just happened that early as he was,
some one was before Buster Bear.

35
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,400
When he came in sight of the little pool,
who should

36
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:58,989
he see but another fisherman there, who had
already caught a fine fat trout.

37
00:02:58,989 --> 00:03:00,200
Who was it?

38
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,870
Why, Little Joe Otter to be sure.

39
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:07,129
He was just climbing up the bank with the
fat trout in his mouth.

40
00:03:07,129 --> 00:03:10,190
Buster Bear's own mouth watered as he saw
it.

41
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:15,370
Little Joe sat down on the bank and prepared
to enjoy his breakfast.

42
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:20,630
He hadn't seen Buster Bear, and he didn't
know that he or any one else was anywhere

43
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:22,750
near.

44
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:29,780
Buster Bear tiptoed up very softly until he
was right behind Little Joe Otter.

45
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:37,980
"Woof, woof!" said he in his deepest, most
grumbly-rumbly voice.

46
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:41,549
"That's a very fine looking trout.

47
00:03:41,549 --> 00:03:45,519
I wouldn't mind if I had it myself."

48
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:50,049
Little Joe Otter gave a frightened squeal
and without even turning to see who was speaking

49
00:03:50,049 --> 00:03:54,299
dropped his fish and dived headfirst into
the Laughing Brook.

50
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:59,610
Buster Bear sprang forward and with one of
his big paws caught the fat trout just as

51
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:01,700
it was slipping back into the water.

52
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:07,379
"Here's your trout, Mr. Otter," said he, as
Little Joe put his head out of water to see

53
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:08,620
who had frightened him so.

54
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:09,620
"Come and get it."

55
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:10,620
Illus Here's your trout, Mr. Otter, said he

56
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:11,660
Here's your trout, Mr. Otter, said he.

57
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:12,660
Page 5.

58
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,190
But Little Joe wouldn't.

59
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:16,489
The fact is, he was afraid to.

60
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:21,739
He snarled at Buster Bear and called him a
thief and everything bad he could think of.

61
00:04:21,739 --> 00:04:23,500
Buster didn't seem to mind.

62
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:28,900
He chuckled as if he thought it all a great
joke and repeated his invitation to Little

63
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,770
Joe to come and get his fish.

64
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:36,940
But Little Joe just turned his back and went
off down the Laughing Brook in a great rage.

65
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:43,009
"It's too bad to waste such a fine fish,"
said Buster thoughtfully.

66
00:04:43,009 --> 00:04:46,889
"I wonder what I'd better do with it."

67
00:04:46,889 --> 00:04:50,880
And while he was wondering, he ate it all
up.

68
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:56,760
Then he started down the Laughing Brook to
try to catch some for himself.

69
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:05,190
CHAPTER II
LITTLE JOE OTTER GETS EVEN WITH BUSTER BEAR

70
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:07,930
Little Joe Otter was in a terrible rage.

71
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:12,020
It was a bad beginning for a beautiful day
and Little Joe knew it.

72
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:17,920
But who wouldn't be in a rage if his breakfast
was taken from him just as he was about to

73
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,200
eat it?

74
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,039
Anyway, that is what Little Joe told Billy
Mink.

75
00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:28,610
Perhaps he didn't tell it quite exactly as
it was, but you know he was very badly frightened

76
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:30,690
at the time.

77
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:35,140
"I was sitting on the bank of the Laughing
Brook beside one of the little pools,"

78
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:40,460
he told Billy Mink, "and was just going to
eat a fat trout I had caught, when who should

79
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:44,340
come along but that great big bully, Buster
Bear.

80
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:48,360
He took that fat trout away from me and ate
it just as if it belonged to him!

81
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,480
I hate him!

82
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:53,810
If I live long enough I'm going to get even
with him!"

83
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:59,930
Of course that wasn't nice talk and anything
but a nice spirit, but Little Joe Otter's

84
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:05,720
temper is sometimes pretty short, especially
when he is hungry, and this time he had had

85
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,150
no breakfast, you know.

86
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:12,390
Buster Bear hadn't actually taken the fish
away from Little Joe.

87
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:17,180
But looking at the matter as Little Joe did,
it amounted to the same thing.

88
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:22,440
You see, Buster knew perfectly well when he
invited Little Joe to come back and get it

89
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:26,550
that Little Joe wouldn't dare do anything
of the kind.

90
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:29,419
"Where is he now?" asked Billy Mink.

91
00:06:29,419 --> 00:06:32,290
"He's somewhere up the Laughing Brook.

92
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:35,400
I wish he'd fall in and get drowned!"

93
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,180
snapped Little Joe.

94
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:40,110
Billy Mink just had to laugh.

95
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:46,340
The idea of great big Buster Bear getting
drowned in the Laughing Brook was too funny.

96
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:51,849
There wasn't water enough in it anywhere except
down in the Smiling Pool, and that was on

97
00:06:51,849 --> 00:06:55,131
the Green Meadows, where Buster had never
been known to go.

98
00:06:55,131 --> 00:07:00,210
"Let's go see what he is doing," said Billy
Mink.

99
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:06,210
At first Little Joe didn't want to, but at
last his curiosity got the better of his fear,

100
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:07,630
and he agreed.

101
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:13,009
So the two little brown-coated scamps turned
down the Laughing Brook, taking the greatest

102
00:07:13,009 --> 00:07:15,330
care to keep out of sight themselves.

103
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:21,759
They had gone only a little way when Billy
Mink whispered: "Sh-h!

104
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,690
There he is."

105
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:29,229
Sure enough, there was Buster Bear sitting
close beside a little pool and looking into

106
00:07:29,229 --> 00:07:30,830
it very intently.

107
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:37,040
"What's he doing?" asked Little Joe Otter,
as Buster Bear sat for the longest time without

108
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,699
moving.

109
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:44,389
Just then one of Buster's big paws went into
the water as quick as a flash and scooped

110
00:07:44,389 --> 00:07:47,599
out a trout that had ventured too near.

111
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,669
"He's fishing!"

112
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:51,050
exclaimed Billy Mink.

113
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:56,720
And that is just what Buster Bear was doing,
and it was very plain to see that he was having

114
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,720
great fun.

115
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:02,699
When he had eaten the trout he had caught,
he moved along to the next little pool.

116
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:07,139
"They are our fish!" said Little Joe fiercely.

117
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:10,710
"He has no business catching our fish!"

118
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:15,169
"I don't see how we are going to stop him,"
said Billy Mink.

119
00:08:15,169 --> 00:08:16,270
"I do!"

120
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:20,170
cried Little Joe, into whose head an idea
had just popped.

121
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:26,000
"I'm going to drive all the fish out of the
little pools and muddy the water all up.

122
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,930
Then we'll see how many fish he will get!

123
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:31,599
Just you watch me get even with Buster Bear."

124
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:37,260
Little Joe slipped swiftly into the water
and swam straight to the little pool that

125
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,280
Buster Bear would try next.

126
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:43,770
He frightened the fish so that they fled in
every direction.

127
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:49,150
Then he stirred up the mud until the water
was so dirty that Buster couldn't have seen

128
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:51,960
a fish right under his nose.

129
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:56,330
He did the same thing in the next pool and
the next.

130
00:08:56,330 --> 00:09:04,640
Buster Bear's fishing was spoiled for that
day.

131
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:09,440
CHAPTER III
BUSTER BEAR IS GREATLY PUZZLED

132
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:14,490
Buster Bear hadn't enjoyed himself so much
since he came to the Green Forest to live.

133
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:19,670
His fun began when he surprised Little Joe
Otter on the bank of a little pool in the

134
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:26,010
Laughing Brook and Little Joe was so frightened
that he dropped a fat trout he had just caught.

135
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:30,650
It had seemed like a great joke to Buster
Bear, and he had chuckled over it all the

136
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:33,520
time he was eating the fat trout.

137
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:38,360
When he had finished it, he started on to
do some fishing himself.

138
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:41,320
Presently he came to another little pool.

139
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:46,440
He stole up to it very, very softly, so as
not to frighten the fish.

140
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:51,960
Then he sat down close to the edge of it and
didn't move.

141
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:57,850
Buster learned a long time ago that a fisherman
must be patient unless, like Little Joe Otter,

142
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:03,250
he is just as much at home in the water as
the fish themselves, and can swim fast enough

143
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:05,900
to catch them by chasing them.

144
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:09,350
So he didn't move so much as an eye lash.

145
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:14,790
He was so still that he looked almost like
the stump of an old tree.

146
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:20,310
Perhaps that is what the fish thought he was,
for pretty soon, two or three swam right in

147
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:22,730
close to where he was sitting.

148
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:28,980
Now Buster Bear may be big and clumsy looking,
but there isn't anything that can move much

149
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:33,000
quicker than one of those big paws of his
when he wants it to.

150
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,130
One of them moved now, and quicker than a
wink had scooped one of those foolish fish

151
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:41,140
out on to the bank.

152
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:45,910
Buster's little eyes twinkled, and he smacked
his lips as he moved on to the next little

153
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:50,860
pool, for he knew that it was of no use to
stay longer at the first one.

154
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:56,370
The fish were so frightened that they wouldn't
come back for a long, long time.

155
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:59,960
At the next little pool the same thing happened.

156
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:03,830
By this time Buster Bear was in fine spirits.

157
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:08,570
It was fun to catch the fish, and it was still
more fun to eat them.

158
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:13,490
What finer breakfast could any one have than
fresh-caught trout?

159
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:15,390
No wonder he felt good!

160
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:21,490
But it takes more than three trout to fill
Buster Bear's stomach, so he kept on to the

161
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:23,670
next little pool.

162
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:29,400
But this little pool, instead of being beautiful
and clear so that Buster could see right to

163
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:34,950
the bottom of it and so tell if there were
any fish there, was so muddy that he couldn't

164
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:37,070
see into it at all.

165
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:41,780
It looked as if some one had just stirred
up all the mud at the bottom.

166
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:44,810
"Huh!" said Buster Bear.

167
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:48,010
"It's of no use to try to fish here.

168
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:50,960
I would just waste my time.

169
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:54,190
I'll try the next pool."

170
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:57,060
So he went on to the next little pool.

171
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:01,080
He found this just as muddy as the other.

172
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:05,150
Then he went on to another, and this was no
better.

173
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:08,610
Buster sat down and scratched his head.

174
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:09,790
It was puzzling.

175
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:13,510
Yes, Sir, it was puzzling.

176
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:20,570
He looked this way and he looked that way
suspiciously, but there was no one to be seen.

177
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:25,790
Everything was still save for the laughter
of the Laughing Brook.

178
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:31,850
Somehow, it seemed to Buster as if the Brook
were laughing at him.

179
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:39,310
"It's very curious," muttered Buster, "very
curious indeed.

180
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:43,360
It looks as if my fishing is spoiled for to-day.

181
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,260
I don't understand it at all.

182
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:49,730
It's lucky I caught what I did.

183
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:53,730
It looks as if somebody is trying to—ha!"

184
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:58,010
A sudden thought had popped into his head.

185
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:01,360
Then he began to chuckle and finally to laugh.

186
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:11,190
"I do believe that scamp Joe Otter is trying
to get even with me for eating that fat trout!"

187
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:17,840
And then, because Buster Bear always enjoys
a good joke even when it is on himself, he

188
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:23,270
laughed until he had to hold his sides, which
is a whole lot better than going off in a

189
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:26,370
rage as Little Joe Otter had done.

190
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:28,810
"You're pretty smart, Mr.

191
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:29,810
Otter!

192
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:37,680
You're pretty smart, but there are other people
who are smart too," said Buster Bear, and

193
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:49,690
still chuckling, he went off to think up a
plan to get the best of Little Joe Otter.

194
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:52,961
CHAPTER IV
LITTLE JOE OTTER SUPPLIES BUSTER

195
00:13:52,961 --> 00:13:55,810
BEAR WITH A BREAKFAST

196
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:57,770
Getting even just for spite

197
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,310
Doesn't always pay.

198
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:02,270
Fact is, it is very apt

199
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:04,670
To work the other way.

200
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:09,500
That is just how it came about that Little
Joe Otter furnished Buster Bear with the best

201
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:13,100
breakfast he had had for a long time.

202
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,680
He didn't mean to do it.

203
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,130
Oh, my, no!

204
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:20,890
The truth is, he thought all the time that
he was preventing Buster Bear from getting

205
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:22,220
a breakfast.

206
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:28,070
You see he wasn't well enough acquainted with
Buster to know that Buster is quite as smart

207
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:31,710
as he is, and perhaps a little bit smarter.

208
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:35,400
Spite and selfishness were at the bottom of
it.

209
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:41,280
You see Little Joe and Billy Mink had had
all the fishing in the Laughing Brook to themselves

210
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:46,030
so long that they thought no one else had
any right to fish there.

211
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:52,800
To be sure Bobby Coon caught a few little
fish there, but they didn't mind Bobby.

212
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:57,590
Farmer Brown's boy fished there too, sometimes,
and this always made Little Joe and Billy

213
00:14:57,590 --> 00:15:02,520
Mink very angry, but they were so afraid of
him that they didn't dare do anything about

214
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,740
it.

215
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:08,530
But when they discovered that Buster Bear
was a fisherman, they made up their minds

216
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:11,610
that something had got to be done.

217
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:13,670
At least, Little Joe did.

218
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:17,970
"He'll try it again to-morrow morning," said
Little Joe.

219
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:25,130
"I'll keep watch, and as soon as I see him
coming, I'll drive out all the fish, just

220
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:26,240
as I did to-day.

221
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,980
I guess that'll teach him to let our fish
alone."

222
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:37,740
So the next morning Little Joe hid before
daylight close by the little pool where Buster

223
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:40,330
Bear had given him such a fright.

224
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:46,800
Sure enough, just as the Jolly Sunbeams began
to creep through the Green Forest, he saw

225
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,470
Buster Bear coming straight over to the little
pool.

226
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:56,380
Little Joe slipped into the water and chased
all the fish out of the little pool, and stirred

227
00:15:56,380 --> 00:16:01,080
up the mud on the bottom so that the water
was so muddy that the bottom couldn't be seen

228
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,080
at all.

229
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:06,950
Then he hurried down to the next little pool
and did the same thing.

230
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:09,680
Now Buster Bear is very smart.

231
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,940
You know he had guessed the day before who

232
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,910
had spoiled his fishing.

233
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:18,850
So this morning he only went far enough to
make sure that if Little Joe were watching

234
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:23,380
for him, as he was sure he would be, he would
see him coming.

235
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:29,420
Then, instead of keeping on to the little
pool, he hurried to a place way down the Laughing

236
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:35,920
Brook, where the water was very shallow, hardly
over his feet, and there he sat chuckling

237
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,410
to himself.

238
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:41,490
Things happened just as he had expected.

239
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:46,670
The frightened fish Little Joe chased out
of the little pools up above swam down the

240
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:52,430
Laughing Brook, because, you know, Little
Joe was behind them, and there was nowhere

241
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:54,540
else for them to go.

242
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:59,700
When they came to the place where Buster was
waiting, all he had to do was to scoop them

243
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,550
out on to the bank.

244
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:03,140
It was great fun.

245
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:06,949
It didn't take Buster long to catch all the
fish he could eat.

246
00:17:06,949 --> 00:17:11,199
Then he saved a nice fat trout and waited.

247
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:16,630
By and by along came Little Joe Otter, chuckling
to think how he had spoiled Buster Bear's

248
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:18,050
fishing.

249
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:22,260
He was so intent on looking behind him to
see if Buster was coming that he didn't see

250
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:25,790
Buster waiting there until he spoke.

251
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:32,810
"I'm much obliged for the fine breakfast you
have given me," said Buster in his deepest,

252
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:34,740
most grumbly-rumbly voice.

253
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:40,880
"I've saved a fat trout for you to make up
for the one I ate yesterday.

254
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,540
I hope we'll go fishing together often."

255
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:48,940
Then he went off laughing fit to kill himself.

256
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:51,060
Little Joe couldn't find a word to say.

257
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:56,670
He was so surprised and angry that he went
off by himself and sulked.

258
00:17:56,670 --> 00:18:04,330
And Billy Mink, who had been watching, ate
the fat trout.

259
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:18,570
CHAPTER V
GRANDFATHER FROG'S COMMON-SENSE

260
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:21,730
There is nothing quite like common sense to
smooth out troubles.

261
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:27,930
People who have plenty of just plain common
sense are often thought to be very wise.

262
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:33,720
Their neighbors look up to them and are forever
running to them for advice, and they are very

263
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,720
much respected.

264
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,280
That is the way with Grandfather Frog.

265
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,750
He is very old and very wise.

266
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:43,790
Anyway, that is what his neighbors think.

267
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:50,620
The truth is, he simply has a lot of common
sense, which after all is the very best kind

268
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:51,620
of wisdom.

269
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:57,150
Now when Little Joe Otter found that Buster
Bear had been too smart for him and that instead

270
00:18:57,150 --> 00:19:02,820
of spoiling Buster's fishing in the Laughing
Brook he had really made it easier for Buster

271
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:08,600
to catch all the fish he wanted, Little Joe
went off down to the Smiling Pool in a great

272
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,600
rage.

273
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:15,660
Billy Mink stopped long enough to eat the
fat fish Buster had left on the bank and then

274
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:18,790
he too went down to the Smiling Pool.

275
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:25,250
When Little Joe Otter and Billy Mink reached
the Smiling Pool, they climbed up on the Big

276
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:31,970
Rock, and there Little Joe sulked and sulked,
until finally Grandfather Frog asked what

277
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:33,670
the matter was.

278
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:38,510
Little Joe wouldn't tell, but Billy Mink told
the whole story.

279
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:44,040
When he told how Buster had been too smart
for Little Joe, it tickled him so that Billy

280
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:47,320
had to laugh in spite of himself.

281
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,620
So did Grandfather Frog.

282
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:52,850
So did Jerry Muskrat, who had been listening.

283
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:56,530
Of course this made Little Joe angrier than
ever.

284
00:19:56,530 --> 00:20:02,900
He said a lot of unkind things about Buster
Bear and about Billy Mink and Grandfather

285
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:08,710
Frog and Jerry Muskrat, because they had laughed
at the smartness of Buster.

286
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:12,490
"He's nothing but a great big bully and thief!"

287
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:14,370
declared Little Joe.

288
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:15,440
"Chug-a-rum!

289
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:21,510
He may be a bully, because great big people
are very apt to be bullies, and though I haven't

290
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:27,870
seen him, I guess Buster Bear is big enough
from all I have heard, but I don't see how

291
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:30,950
he is a thief," said Grandfather Frog.

292
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:35,540
"Didn't he catch my fish and eat them?" snapped
Little Joe.

293
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:37,910
"Doesn't that make him a thief?"

294
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:42,920
"They were no more your fish than mine," protested
Billy Mink.

295
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:45,040
"Well, our fish, then!

296
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:49,030
He stole our fish, if you like that any better.

297
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:52,160
That makes him just as much a thief, doesn't
it?"

298
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,870
growled Little Joe.

299
00:20:54,870 --> 00:21:00,850
Grandfather Frog looked up at jolly, round,
bright Mr. Sun and slowly winked one of his

300
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:02,900
great, goggly eyes.

301
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:07,580
"There comes a foolish green fly," said he.

302
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:10,120
"Who does he belong to?"

303
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,120
"Nobody!"

304
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,120
snapped Little Joe.

305
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,730
"What have foolish green flies got to do with
my

306
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:17,580
—I mean our fish?"

307
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:23,540
"Nothing, nothing at all," replied Grandfather
Frog mildly.

308
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:29,110
"I was just hoping that he would come near
enough for me to snap him up; then he would

309
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:30,190
belong to me.

310
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:35,660
As long as he doesn't, he doesn't belong to
any one.

311
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:41,100
I suppose that if Buster Bear should happen
along and catch him, he would be stealing

312
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:44,140
from me, according to Little Joe."

313
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:45,980
"Of course not!

314
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:48,430
What a silly idea!

315
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:50,880
You're getting foolish in your old age,"

316
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,460
retorted Little Joe.

317
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:57,490
"Can you tell me the difference between the
fish that you haven't caught and the foolish

318
00:21:57,490 --> 00:22:03,280
green flies that I haven't caught?" asked
Grandfather Frog.

319
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,180
Little Joe couldn't find a word to say.

320
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:12,980
"You take my advice, Little Joe Otter," continued
Grandfather Frog, "and always make friends

321
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:17,890
with those who are bigger and stronger and
smarter than you are.

322
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:19,400
You'll find it pays."

323
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:22,010
Illus You take my advice, Little Joe Otter,
continued Grandfather Frog.

324
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:23,900
You take my advice, Little Joe Otter, continued

325
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:24,900
Grandfather Frog.

327
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:28,710
CHAPTER VI
LITTLE JOE OTTER TAKES GRANDFATHER

328
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:30,900
FROG'S ADVICE

329
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,930
Who makes an enemy a friend,

330
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:36,740
To fear and worry puts an end.

331
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:40,120
Little Joe Otter found that out when he took
Grandfather Frog's advice.

332
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:45,030
He wouldn't have admitted that he was afraid
of Buster Bear.

333
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:49,640
No one ever likes to admit being afraid, least
of all Little Joe Otter.

334
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:52,830
And really Little Joe has a great deal of
courage.

335
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:58,120
Very few of the little people of the Green
Forest or the Green Meadows would willingly

336
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:02,540
quarrel with him, for Little Joe is a great
fighter when he has to fight.

337
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:08,590
As for all those who live in or along the
Laughing Brook or in the Smiling Pool, they

338
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:12,410
let Little Joe have his own way in everything.

339
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:17,470
Now having one's own way too much is a bad
thing.

340
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:22,700
It is apt to make one selfish and thoughtless
of other people and very hard to get along

341
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,160
with.

342
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:27,860
Little Joe Otter had his way too much.

343
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:33,100
Grandfather Frog knew it and shook his head
very soberly when Little Joe had been disrespectful

344
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,100
to him.

345
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,200
"Too bad.

346
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,470
Too bad!

347
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:37,730
Too bad!

348
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:38,730
Chug-a-rum!

349
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:45,270
It is too bad that such a fine young fellow
as Little Joe should spoil a good disposition

350
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:47,180
by such selfish heedlessness.

351
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:50,690
Too bad," said he.

352
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:56,600
So, though he didn't let on that it was so,
Grandfather Frog really was delighted when

353
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:01,010
he heard how Buster Bear had been too smart
for Little Joe Otter.

354
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:06,150
It tickled him so that he had hard work to
keep a straight face.

355
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:12,180
But he did and was as grave and solemn as
you please as he advised Little Joe always

356
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:17,850
to make friends with any one who was bigger
and stronger and smarter than he.

357
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:23,740
That was good common sense advice, but Little
Joe just sniffed and went off declaring that

358
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:26,620
he would get even with Buster Bear yet.

359
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:32,520
Now Little Joe is good-natured and full of
fun as a rule, and after he had reached home

360
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:38,831
and his temper had cooled off a little, he
began to see the joke on himself,—how when

361
00:24:38,831 --> 00:24:43,780
he had worked so hard to frighten the fish
in the little pools of the Laughing Brook

362
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:49,530
so that Buster Bear should not catch any,
he had all the time been driving them right

363
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:51,820
into Buster's paws.

364
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:55,230
By and by he grinned.

365
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:59,100
It was a little sheepish grin at first, but
at last it

366
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,760
grew into a laugh.

367
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:07,890
"I believe," said Little Joe as he wiped tears
of laughter from his eyes, "that Grandfather

368
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:13,460
Frog is right, and that the best thing I can
do is to make friends with Buster Bear.

369
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:17,020
I'll try it to-morrow morning."

370
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:21,980
So very early the next morning Little Joe
Otter went to the best fishing pool he knew

371
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:27,710
of in the Laughing Brook, and there he caught
the biggest trout he could find.

372
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:33,140
It was so big and fat that it made Little
Joe's mouth water, for you know fat trout

373
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:35,059
are his favorite food.

374
00:25:35,059 --> 00:25:38,240
But he didn't take so much as one bite.

375
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:44,011
Instead he carefully laid it on an old log
where Buster Bear would be sure to see it

376
00:25:44,011 --> 00:25:46,860
if he should come along that way.

377
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:50,800
Then he hid near by, where he could watch.

378
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,260
Buster was late that morning.

379
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:56,560
It seemed to Little Joe that he never would
come.

380
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,420
Once he nearly lost the fish.

381
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:03,080
He had turned his head for just a minute,
and when he looked back again, the trout was

382
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:05,900
nowhere to be seen.

383
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:09,770
Buster couldn't have stolen up and taken it,
because such a big fellow couldn't possibly

384
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:12,720
have gotten out of sight again.

385
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,730
Little Joe darted over to the log and looked
on the other side.

386
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:24,330
There was the fat trout, and there also was
Little Joe's smallest cousin, Shadow the Weasel,

387
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:28,550
who is a great thief and altogether bad.

388
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:34,270
Little Joe sprang at him angrily, but Shadow
was too quick and darted away.

389
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:37,400
Little Joe put the fish back on the log and
waited.

390
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:40,560
This time he didn't take his eyes off it.

391
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:47,640
At last, when he was almost ready to give
up, he saw Buster Bear shuffling along towards

392
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,130
the Laughing Brook.

393
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:52,540
Suddenly Buster stopped and sniffed.

394
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:59,080
One of the Merry Little Breezes had carried
the scent of that fat trout over to him.

395
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:05,809
Then he came straight over to where the fish
lay, his nose wrinkling, and his eyes twinkling

396
00:27:05,809 --> 00:27:06,880
with pleasure.

397
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:15,570
"Now I wonder who was so thoughtful as to
leave this fine breakfast ready for me," said

398
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:17,059
he out loud.

399
00:27:17,059 --> 00:27:21,630
"Me," said Little Joe in a rather faint voice.

400
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:25,550
"I caught it especially for you."

401
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:31,480
"Thank you," replied Buster, and his eyes
twinkled more than ever.

402
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:34,780
"I think we are going to be friends."

403
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:41,620
"I—I hope so," replied Little Joe.

404
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:48,090
CHAPTER VII
FARMER BROWN'S BOY HAS NO LUCK

405
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:49,690
AT ALL

406
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:54,620
Farmer Brown's boy tramped through the Green
Forest, whistling merrily.

407
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:59,070
He always whistles when he feels light-hearted,
and he always feels light-hearted when he

408
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:00,070
goes fishing.

409
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:06,090
You see, he is just as fond of fishing as
is Little Joe Otter or Billy Mink or Buster

410
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:07,090
Bear.

411
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:11,870
And now he was making his way through the
Green Forest to the Laughing Brook, sure that

412
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:17,100
by the time he had followed it down to the
Smiling Pool he would have a fine lot of trout

413
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:18,130
to take home.

414
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:23,309
He knew every pool in the Laughing Brook where
the trout love to hide, did Farmer Brown's

415
00:28:23,309 --> 00:28:27,390
boy, and it was just the kind of a morning
when the trout should be hungry.

416
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:33,570
So he whistled as he tramped along, and his
whistle was good to hear.

417
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:38,910
When he reached the first little pool he baited
his hook very carefully and then, taking the

418
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:43,750
greatest care to keep out of sight of any
trout that might be in the little pool, he

419
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:45,820
began to fish.

420
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:51,370
Now Farmer Brown's boy learned a long time
ago that to be a successful fisherman one

421
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:56,730
must have a great deal of patience, so though
he didn't get a bite right away as he had

422
00:28:56,730 --> 00:29:00,360
expected to, he wasn't the least bit discouraged.

423
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:06,720
He kept very quiet and fished and fished,
patiently waiting for a foolish trout to take

424
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,960
his hook.

425
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:10,270
But he didn't get so much as a nibble.

426
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:16,810
"Either the trout have lost their appetite
or they have grown very wise," muttered Farmer

427
00:29:16,810 --> 00:29:21,820
Brown's boy, as after a long time he moved
on to the next little pool.

428
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:24,809
There the same thing happened.

429
00:29:24,809 --> 00:29:32,520
He was very patient, very, very patient, but
his patience brought no reward, not so much

430
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,330
as the faintest kind of a nibble.

431
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:40,170
Farmer Brown's boy trudged on to the next
pool, and there was a puzzled frown on his

432
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:42,200
freckled face.

433
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:45,110
Such a thing never had happened before.

434
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:47,320
He didn't know what to make of it.

435
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:52,309
All the night before he had dreamed about
the delicious dinner of fried trout he would

436
00:29:52,309 --> 00:29:58,040
have the next day, and now—well, if he didn't
catch some trout pretty soon, that splendid

437
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,980
dinner would never be anything but a dream.

438
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:07,040
"If I didn't know that nobody else comes fishing
here, I should think that somebody had been

439
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:12,110
here this very morning and caught all the
fish or else frightened them so that they

440
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:17,100
are all in hiding," said he, as he trudged
on to the next little pool.

441
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:22,690
"I never had such bad luck in all my life
before.

442
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:23,690
Hello!

443
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:24,690
What's

444
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:25,690
this?"

445
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:31,850
There, on the bank beside the little pool,
were the heads of three trout.

446
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:37,320
Farmer Brown's boy scowled down at them more
puzzled than ever.

447
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:43,490
"Somebody has been fishing here, and they
have had better luck than I have," thought

448
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:44,490
he.

449
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:49,010
He looked up the Laughing Brook and down the
Laughing Brook and this way and that way,

450
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:51,360
but no one was to be seen.

451
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:56,570
Then he picked up one of the little heads
and looked at it sharply.

452
00:30:56,570 --> 00:31:01,140
"It wasn't cut off with a knife; it was bitten
off!" he exclaimed.

453
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:07,400
"I wonder now if Billy Mink is the scamp who
has spoiled my fun."

454
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:12,530
Thereafter he kept a sharp lookout for signs
of Billy Mink, but though he found two or

455
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:17,360
three more trout heads, he saw no other signs
and he caught no fish.

456
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,480
This puzzled him more than ever.

457
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:25,390
It didn't seem possible that such a little
fellow as Billy Mink could have caught or

458
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:28,330
frightened all the fish or have eaten so many.

459
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:34,200
Besides, he didn't remember ever having known
Billy to leave heads around that way.

460
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:39,470
Billy sometimes catches more fish than he
can eat, but then he usually hides them.

461
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:45,330
The farther he went down the Laughing Brook,
the more puzzled Farmer Brown's boy grew.

462
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:47,450
It made him feel very queer.

463
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:52,370
He would have felt still more queer if he
had known that all the time two other fishermen

464
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:57,770
who had been before him were watching him
and chuckling to themselves.

465
00:31:57,770 --> 00:32:05,060
They were Little Joe Otter and Buster Bear.

466
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:08,420
CHAPTER VIII
FARMER BROWN'S BOY FEELS HIS

467
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:09,420
HAIR RISE

468
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:12,880
'Twas just a sudden odd surprise

469
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,710
Made Farmer Brown's boy's hair to rise.

470
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:21,420
That's a funny thing for hair to do—rise
up all of a sudden—isn't it?

471
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:26,610
But that is just what the hair on Farmer Brown's
boy's head did the day he went fishing in

472
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:29,300
the Laughing Brook and had no luck at all.

473
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:34,330
There are just two things that make hair rise—anger
and fear.

474
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:40,070
Anger sometimes makes the hair on the back
and neck of Bowser the Hound and of some other

475
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:45,590
little people bristle and stand up, and you
know the hair on the tail of Black Pussy stands

476
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:49,690
on end until her tail looks twice as big as
it really is.

477
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:53,580
Both anger and fear make it do that.

478
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:57,390
But there is only one thing that can make
the hair on the head of Farmer Brown's boy

479
00:32:57,390 --> 00:33:03,000
rise, and as it isn't anger, of course it
must be fear.

480
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,870
It never had happened before.

481
00:33:04,870 --> 00:33:09,809
You see, there isn't much of anything that
Farmer Brown's boy is really afraid of.

482
00:33:09,809 --> 00:33:14,040
Perhaps he wouldn't have been afraid this
time if it hadn't been for the surprise of

483
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,040
what he found.

484
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:20,950
You see when he had found the heads of those
trout on the bank he knew right away that

485
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:26,130
some one else had been fishing, and that was
why he couldn't catch any; but it didn't seem

486
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:31,809
possible that little Billy Mink could have
eaten all those trout, and Farmer Brown's

487
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:39,080
boy didn't once think of Little Joe Otter,
and so he was very, very much puzzled.

488
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:43,559
He was turning it all over in his mind and
studying what it could mean, when he came

489
00:33:43,559 --> 00:33:48,840
to a little muddy place on the bank of the
Laughing Brook, and there he saw something

490
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:54,890
that made his eyes look as if they would pop
right out of his head, and it was right then

491
00:33:54,890 --> 00:33:57,040
that he felt his hair rise.

492
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:01,760
Anyway, that is what he said when he told
about it afterward.

493
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,590
What was it he saw?

494
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:04,850
What do you think?

495
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:09,349
Why, it was a footprint in the soft mud.

496
00:34:09,349 --> 00:34:13,470
Yes, Sir, that's what it was, and all it was.

497
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:21,470
But it was the biggest footprint Farmer Brown's
boy ever had seen, and it looked as if it

498
00:34:21,470 --> 00:34:24,950
had been made only a few minutes before.

499
00:34:24,950 --> 00:34:28,740
It was the footprint of Buster Bear.

500
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:35,730
Now Farmer Brown's boy didn't know that Buster
Bear had come down to the Green Forest to

501
00:34:35,730 --> 00:34:36,730
live.

502
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:40,720
He never had heard of a Bear being in the
Green Forest.

503
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:47,340
And so he was so surprised that he had hard
work to believe his own eyes, and he had a

504
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:53,600
queer feeling all over,—a little chilly
feeling, although it was a warm day.

505
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:57,570
Somehow, he didn't feel like meeting Buster
Bear.

506
00:34:57,570 --> 00:35:02,040
If he had had his terrible gun with him, it
might have been different.

507
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:07,850
But he didn't, and so he suddenly made up
his mind that he didn't want to fish any more

508
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:09,300
that day.

509
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:15,820
He had a funny feeling, too, that he was being
watched, although he couldn't see any one.

510
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:18,160
He was being watched.

511
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:24,810
Little Joe Otter and Buster Bear were watching
him and taking the greatest care to keep out

512
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:26,790
of his sight.

513
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:32,760
All the way home through the Green Forest,
Farmer Brown's boy kept looking behind him,

514
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:37,570
and he didn't draw a long breath until he
reached the edge of the Green Forest.

515
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:41,300
He hadn't run, but he had wanted to.

516
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:50,020
"Huh!" said Buster Bear to Little Joe Otter,
"I believe he was afraid!"

517
00:35:50,020 --> 00:36:04,230
And Buster Bear was just exactly right.

518
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:07,310
CHAPTER IX
LITTLE JOE OTTER HAS GREAT NEWS

519
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:09,270
TO TELL

520
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:12,690
Little Joe Otter was fairly bursting with
excitement.

521
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:14,330
He could hardly contain himself.

522
00:36:14,330 --> 00:36:20,460
He felt that he had the greatest news to tell
since Peter Rabbit had first found the tracks

523
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:23,590
of Buster Bear in the Green Forest.

524
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:27,080
He couldn't keep it to himself a minute longer
than he had to.

525
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:32,880
So he hurried to the Smiling Pool, where he
was sure he would find Billy Mink and Jerry

526
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:39,180
Muskrat and Grandfather Frog and Spotty the
Turtle, and he hoped that perhaps some of

527
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:42,810
the little people who live in the Green Forest
might be there too.

528
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:49,359
Sure enough, Peter Rabbit was there on one
side of the Smiling Pool, making faces at

529
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:57,170
Reddy Fox, who was on the other side, which,
of course, was not at all nice of Peter.

530
00:36:57,170 --> 00:37:03,840
Mr. and Mrs. Redwing were there, and Blacky
the Crow was sitting in the Big Hickory-tree.

531
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:10,490
Little Joe Otter swam straight to the Big
Rock and climbed up to the very highest part.

532
00:37:10,490 --> 00:37:16,040
He looked so excited, and his eyes sparkled
so, that every one knew right away that something

533
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,690
had happened.

534
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:19,770
"Hi!" cried Billy Mink.

535
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:21,710
"Look at Little Joe Otter!

536
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:27,590
It must be that for once he has been smarter
than Buster Bear."

537
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:31,860
Little Joe made a good-natured face at Billy
Mink and shook his head.

538
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:36,820
"No, Billy," said he, "you are wrong, altogether
wrong.

539
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:41,410
I don't believe anybody can be smarter than
Buster Bear."

540
00:37:41,410 --> 00:37:42,730
Illus Reddy glared across the Smiling Pool
at Peter.

541
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:46,630
Reddy Fox rolled his lips back in an unpleasant
grin.

542
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:50,500
"Don't be too sure of that!"

543
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:51,500
he snapped.

544
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:54,950
"I'm not through with him yet."

545
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:55,950
"Boaster!

546
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:56,950
Boaster!"

547
00:37:56,950 --> 00:37:57,950
cried Peter Rabbit.

548
00:37:57,950 --> 00:38:00,600
Reddy glared across the Smiling Pool at Peter.

549
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:06,080
"I'm not through with you either, Peter Rabbit!"
he snarled.

550
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,380
"You'll find it out one of these fine days!"

551
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:11,720
"Reddy, Reddy, smart and sly,

552
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:15,100
Couldn't catch a buzzing fly!"

553
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:16,700
taunted Peter.

554
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:20,780
"Chug-a-rum!" said Grandfather Frog in his
deepest, gruffest voice.

555
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:22,940
"We know all about that.

556
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:29,050
What we want to know is what Little Joe Otter
has got on his mind."

557
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:30,850
"It's news—great news!"

558
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:32,040
cried Little Joe.

559
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:38,760
"We can tell better how great it is when we
hear what it is," replied Grandfather Frog

560
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,830
testily.

561
00:38:39,830 --> 00:38:43,040
"What is it?"

562
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:47,730
Little Joe Otter looked around at all the
eager faces watching him, and then in the

563
00:38:47,730 --> 00:39:00,560
slowest, most provoking way, he drawled: "Farmer
Brown's boy is afraid of Buster Bear."

564
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:03,580
For a minute no one said a word.

565
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:09,810
Then Blacky the Crow leaned down from his
perch in the Big Hickory-tree and looked very

566
00:39:09,810 --> 00:39:12,230
hard at Little Joe as he said:

567
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:15,100
"I don't believe it.

568
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:18,160
I don't believe a word of it.

569
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:24,250
Farmer Brown's boy isn't afraid of any one
who lives in the Green Forest or on the Green

570
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:28,680
Meadows or in the Smiling Pool, and you know
it.

571
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:31,690
We are all afraid of him."

572
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:33,600
Little Joe glared back at Blacky.

573
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:39,270
"I don't care whether you believe it or not;
it's true," he retorted.

574
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:44,350
Then he told how early that very morning he
and Buster Bear had been fishing together

575
00:39:44,350 --> 00:39:49,790
in the Laughing Brook, and how Farmer Brown's
boy had been fishing there too, and hadn't

576
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:55,810
caught a single trout because they had all
been caught or frightened before he got there.

577
00:39:55,810 --> 00:40:01,530
Then he told how Farmer Brown's boy had found
a footprint of Buster Bear in the soft mud,

578
00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:06,849
and how he had stopped fishing right away
and started for home, looking behind him with

579
00:40:06,849 --> 00:40:08,920
fear in his eyes all the way.

580
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:12,040
"Now tell me that he isn't afraid!"

581
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,480
concluded Little Joe.

582
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:19,390
"For once he knows just how we feel when he
comes prowling around where we are.

583
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:22,010
Isn't that great news?

584
00:40:22,010 --> 00:40:24,170
Now we'll get even with him!"

585
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:29,740
"I'll believe it when I see it for myself!"

586
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:36,490
snapped Blacky the Crow.

587
00:40:36,490 --> 00:40:39,910
CHAPTER X
BUSTER BEAR BECOMES A HERO

588
00:40:39,910 --> 00:40:46,290
The news that Little Joe Otter told at the
Smiling Pool,—how Farmer Brown's boy had

589
00:40:46,290 --> 00:40:52,330
run away from Buster Bear without even seeing
him,—soon spread all over the Green Meadows

590
00:40:52,330 --> 00:40:57,160
and through the Green Forest, until every
one who lives there knew about it.

591
00:40:57,160 --> 00:41:00,120
Of course, Peter Rabbit helped spread it.

592
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,710
Trust Peter for that!

593
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:03,650
But everybody else helped too.

594
00:41:03,650 --> 00:41:09,290
You see, they had all been afraid of Farmer
Brown's boy for so long that they were tickled

595
00:41:09,290 --> 00:41:14,570
almost to pieces at the very thought of having
some one in the Green Forest who could make

596
00:41:14,570 --> 00:41:18,450
Farmer Brown's boy feel fear as they had felt
it.

597
00:41:18,450 --> 00:41:24,960
And so it was that Buster Bear became a hero
right away to most of them.

598
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,780
A few doubted Little Joe's story.

599
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:30,440
One of them was Blacky the Crow.

600
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,450
Another was Reddy Fox.

601
00:41:32,450 --> 00:41:38,740
Blacky doubted because he knew Farmer Brown's
boy so well that he couldn't imagine him afraid.

602
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:41,770
Reddy doubted because he didn't want to believe.

603
00:41:41,770 --> 00:41:47,840
You see, he was jealous of Buster Bear, and
at the same time he was afraid of him.

604
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:52,950
So Reddy pretended not to believe a word of
what Little Joe Otter had said, and he agreed

605
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:59,099
with Blacky that only by seeing Farmer Brown's
boy afraid could he ever be made to believe

606
00:41:59,099 --> 00:42:00,099
it.

607
00:42:00,099 --> 00:42:04,710
But nearly everybody else believed it, and
there was great rejoicing.

608
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:11,630
Most of them were afraid of Buster, very much
afraid of him, because he was so big and strong.

609
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:16,310
But they were still more afraid of Farmer
Brown's boy, because they didn't know him

610
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:22,970
or understand him, and because in the past
he had tried to catch some of them in traps

611
00:42:22,970 --> 00:42:27,620
and had hunted some of them with his terrible
gun.

612
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:33,040
So now they were very proud to think that
one of their own number actually had frightened

613
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:37,880
him, and they began to look on Buster Bear
as a real hero.

614
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:43,220
They tried in ever so many ways to show him
how friendly they felt and went quite out

615
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:45,510
of their way to do him favors.

616
00:42:45,510 --> 00:42:51,760
Whenever they met one another, all they could
talk about was the smartness and the greatness

617
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,670
of Buster Bear.

618
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:59,040
"Now I guess Farmer Brown's boy will keep
away from the Green Forest, and we won't have

619
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:04,190
to be all the time watching out for him,"
said Bobby Coon, as he washed his dinner in

620
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:08,430
the Laughing Brook, for you know he is very
neat and particular.

621
00:43:08,430 --> 00:43:13,810
"And he won't dare set any more traps for
me," gloated Billy Mink.

622
00:43:13,810 --> 00:43:20,859
"Ah wish Brer Bear would go up to Farmer Brown's
henhouse and scare Farmer Brown's boy so that

623
00:43:20,859 --> 00:43:22,690
he would keep away from there.

624
00:43:22,690 --> 00:43:29,210
It would be a favor to me which Ah cert'nly
would appreciate," said Unc' Billy Possum

625
00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:30,930
when he heard the news.

626
00:43:30,930 --> 00:43:36,370
"Let's all go together and tell Buster Bear
how much obliged we are for what he has done,"

627
00:43:36,370 --> 00:43:38,570
proposed Jerry Muskrat.

628
00:43:38,570 --> 00:43:40,460
"That's a splendid idea!"

629
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:41,650
cried Little Joe Otter.

630
00:43:41,650 --> 00:43:43,830
"We'll do it right away."

631
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:47,270
"Caw, caw caw!"

632
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:48,270
broke in Blacky the Crow.

633
00:43:48,270 --> 00:43:54,030
"I say, let's wait and see for ourselves if
it is all true."

634
00:43:54,030 --> 00:43:56,220
"Of course it's true!"

635
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:58,050
snapped Little Joe Otter.

636
00:43:58,050 --> 00:44:00,700
"Don't you believe I'm telling the truth?"

637
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:02,180
"Certainly, certainly.

638
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:08,540
Of course no one doubts your word," replied
Blacky, with the utmost politeness.

639
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:16,310
"But you say yourself that Farmer Brown's
boy didn't see Buster Bear, but only his footprint.

640
00:44:16,310 --> 00:44:22,760
Perhaps he didn't know whose it was, and if
he had he wouldn't have been afraid.

641
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:29,680
Now I've got a plan by which we can see for
ourselves if he really is afraid of Buster

642
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:30,680
Bear."

643
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:34,910
"What is it?" asked Sammy Jay eagerly.

644
00:44:34,910 --> 00:44:38,820
Blacky the Crow shook his head and winked.

645
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:40,630
"That's telling," said he.

646
00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:43,150
"I want to think it over.

647
00:44:43,150 --> 00:44:47,710
If you meet me at the Big Hickory-tree at
sun-up to-morrow morning, and get everybody

648
00:44:47,710 --> 00:44:55,940
else to come that you can, perhaps I will
tell you."

649
00:44:55,940 --> 00:45:00,880
CHAPTER XI
BLACKY THE CROW TELLS HIS PLAN

650
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,500
Blacky is a dreamer!

651
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:03,960
Blacky is a schemer!

652
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:05,920
His voice is strong;

653
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:08,099
When things go wrong

654
00:45:08,099 --> 00:45:09,470
Blacky is a screamer!

655
00:45:09,470 --> 00:45:11,720
It's a fact.

656
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:18,710
Blacky the Crow is forever dreaming and scheming
and almost always it is of mischief.

657
00:45:18,710 --> 00:45:22,590
He is one of the smartest and cleverest of
all the little people of the Green Meadows

658
00:45:22,590 --> 00:45:26,360
and the Green Forest, and all the others know
it.

659
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:28,130
Blacky likes excitement.

660
00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:30,180
He wants something going on.

661
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:33,060
The more exciting it is, the better he likes
it.

662
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:38,810
Then he has a chance to use that harsh voice
of his, and how he does use it!

663
00:45:38,810 --> 00:45:45,869
So now, as he sat in the top of the Big Hickory-tree
beside the Smiling Pool and looked down on

664
00:45:45,869 --> 00:45:49,630
all the little people gathered there, he was
very happy.

665
00:45:49,630 --> 00:45:56,290
In the first place he felt very important,
and you know Blacky dearly loves to feel important.

666
00:45:56,290 --> 00:46:01,910
They had all come at his invitation to listen
to a plan for seeing for themselves if it

667
00:46:01,910 --> 00:46:06,470
were really true that Farmer Brown's boy was
afraid of Buster Bear.

668
00:46:06,470 --> 00:46:12,830
On the Big Rock in the Smiling Pool sat Little
Joe Otter, Billy Mink, and Jerry Muskrat.

669
00:46:12,830 --> 00:46:17,400
On his big, green lily-pad sat Grandfather
Frog.

670
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:20,730
On another lily-pad sat Spotty the Turtle.

671
00:46:20,730 --> 00:46:26,320
On the bank on one side of the Smiling Pool
were Peter Rabbit, Jumper the Hare, Danny

672
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:33,410
Meadow Mouse, Johnny Chuck, Jimmy Skunk, Unc'
Billy Possum, Striped Chipmunk and Old Mr.

673
00:46:33,410 --> 00:46:34,780
Toad.

674
00:46:34,780 --> 00:46:41,810
On the other side of the Smiling Pool were
Reddy Fox, Digger the Badger, and Bobby Coon.

675
00:46:41,810 --> 00:46:47,010
In the Big Hickory-tree were Chatterer the
Red Squirrel, Happy Jack the Gray Squirrel,

676
00:46:47,010 --> 00:46:49,320
and Sammy Jay.

677
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:52,000
Blacky waited until he was sure that no one
else was coming.

678
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:57,010
Then he cleared his throat very loudly and
began to speak.

679
00:46:57,010 --> 00:47:00,690
"Friends," said he.

680
00:47:00,690 --> 00:47:05,570
Everybody grinned, for Blacky has played so
many sharp tricks that no one is really his

681
00:47:05,570 --> 00:47:09,930
friend unless it is that other mischief-maker,
Sammy Jay, who, you

682
00:47:09,930 --> 00:47:12,570
know, is Blacky's cousin.

683
00:47:12,570 --> 00:47:16,090
But no one said anything, and Blacky went
on.

684
00:47:16,090 --> 00:47:23,310
"Little Joe Otter has told us how he saw Farmer
Brown's boy hurry home when he found the footprint

685
00:47:23,310 --> 00:47:28,510
of Buster Bear on the edge of the Laughing
Brook, and how all the way he kept looking

686
00:47:28,510 --> 00:47:30,200
behind him, as if he were afraid.

687
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:35,620
Perhaps he was, and then again perhaps he
wasn't.

688
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:38,290
Perhaps he had something else on his mind.

689
00:47:38,290 --> 00:47:44,860
You have made a hero of Buster Bear, because
you believe Little Joe's story.

690
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:51,080
Now I don't say that I don't believe it, but
I do say that I will be a lot more sure that

691
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:56,690
Farmer Brown's boy is afraid of Buster when
I see him run away myself.

692
00:47:56,690 --> 00:48:01,300
Now here is my plan:

693
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:06,690
"To-morrow morning, very early, Sammy Jay
and I will make a great fuss near the edge

694
00:48:06,690 --> 00:48:08,390
of the Green Forest.

695
00:48:08,390 --> 00:48:13,984
Farmer Brown's boy has a lot of curiosity,
and he will be sure to come over to see what

696
00:48:13,984 --> 00:48:15,800
it is all about.

697
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:19,260
Then we will lead him to where Buster Bear
is.

698
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:25,390
If he runs away, I will be the first to admit
that Buster Bear is as great a hero as some

699
00:48:25,390 --> 00:48:27,020
of you seem to think he is.

700
00:48:27,020 --> 00:48:33,750
It is a very simple plan, and if you will
all hide where you can watch, you will be

701
00:48:33,750 --> 00:48:38,130
able to see for yourselves if Little Joe Otter
is right.

702
00:48:38,130 --> 00:48:42,010
Now what do you say?"

703
00:48:42,010 --> 00:48:45,010
Right away everybody began to talk at the
same time.

704
00:48:45,010 --> 00:48:48,430
It was such a simple plan that everybody agreed
to it.

705
00:48:48,430 --> 00:48:54,260
And it promised to be so exciting that everybody
promised to be there, that is, everybody but

706
00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:59,590
Grandfather Frog and Spotty the Turtle, who
didn't care to go so far away from the Smiling

707
00:48:59,590 --> 00:49:01,070
Pool.

708
00:49:01,070 --> 00:49:10,250
So it was agreed that Blacky should try his
plan the very next morning.

709
00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:13,820
CHAPTER XII
FARMER BROWN'S BOY AND BUSTER

710
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:16,640
BEAR GROW CURIOUS

711
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:21,050
Ever since it was light enough to see at all,
Blacky the Crow had been sitting in the top

712
00:49:21,050 --> 00:49:27,060
of the tallest tree on the edge of the Green
Forest nearest to Farmer Brown's house, and

713
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:32,110
never for an instant had he taken his eyes
from Farmer Brown's back door.

714
00:49:32,110 --> 00:49:33,530
What was he watching for?

715
00:49:33,530 --> 00:49:38,339
Why, for Farmer Brown's boy to come out on
his way to milk the cows.

716
00:49:38,339 --> 00:49:44,350
Meanwhile, Sammy Jay was slipping silently
through the Green Forest, looking for Buster

717
00:49:44,350 --> 00:49:49,450
Bear, so that when the time came he could
let his cousin, Blacky the Crow, know just

718
00:49:49,450 --> 00:49:51,360
where Buster was.

719
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:56,980
By and by the back door of Farmer Brown's
house opened, and out stepped Farmer Brown's

720
00:49:56,980 --> 00:49:57,980
boy.

721
00:49:57,980 --> 00:50:00,800
In each hand he carried a milk pail.

722
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:05,630
Right away Blacky began to scream at the top
of his lungs.

723
00:50:05,630 --> 00:50:08,530
"Caw, caw, caw!"

724
00:50:08,530 --> 00:50:10,460
shouted Blacky.

725
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:13,369
"Caw, caw, caw!"

726
00:50:13,369 --> 00:50:18,331
And all the time he flew about among the trees
near the edge of the Green Forest as if so

727
00:50:18,331 --> 00:50:21,340
excited that he couldn't keep still.

728
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:25,920
Farmer Brown's boy looked over there as if
he wondered what all that fuss was about,

729
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:30,150
as indeed he did, but he didn't start to go
over and see.

730
00:50:30,150 --> 00:50:34,620
No, Sir, he started straight for the barn.

731
00:50:34,620 --> 00:50:36,810
Blacky didn't know what to make of it.

732
00:50:36,810 --> 00:50:42,650
You see, smart as he is and shrewd as he is,
Blacky doesn't know anything about the meaning

733
00:50:42,650 --> 00:50:46,859
of duty, for he never has to work excepting
to get enough to eat.

734
00:50:46,859 --> 00:50:52,540
So, when Farmer Brown's boy started for the
barn instead of for the Green Forest, Blacky

735
00:50:52,540 --> 00:50:54,360
didn't know what to make of it.

736
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:59,820
He screamed harder and louder than ever, until
his voice grew so hoarse he couldn't scream

737
00:50:59,820 --> 00:51:04,109
any more, but Farmer Brown's boy kept right
on to the barn.

738
00:51:04,109 --> 00:51:09,550
"I'd like to know what you're making such
a fuss about, Mr. Crow, but I've got to feed

739
00:51:09,550 --> 00:51:12,940
the cows and milk them first," said he.

740
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:17,450
Now all this time the other little people
of the Green Forest and the Green Meadows

741
00:51:17,450 --> 00:51:21,200
had been hiding where they could see all that
went on.

742
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:25,950
When Farmer Brown's boy disappeared in the
barn, Chatterer the Red Squirrel snickered

743
00:51:25,950 --> 00:51:26,950
right out loud.

744
00:51:26,950 --> 00:51:28,300
"Ha, ha, ha!

745
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:31,460
This is a great plan of yours, Blacky!

746
00:51:31,460 --> 00:51:34,290
Ha, ha, ha!" he shouted.

747
00:51:34,290 --> 00:51:36,320
Blacky couldn't find a word to say.

748
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:40,080
He just hung his head, which is something
Blacky seldom does.

749
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:46,250
"Perhaps if we wait until he comes out again,
he will come over here," said Sammy Jay, who

750
00:51:46,250 --> 00:51:47,520
had joined Blacky.

751
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:50,070
So it was decided to wait.

752
00:51:50,070 --> 00:51:55,940
It seemed as if Farmer Brown's boy never would
come out, but at last he did.

753
00:51:55,940 --> 00:52:01,020
Blacky and Sammy Jay at once began to scream
and make all the fuss they could.

754
00:52:01,020 --> 00:52:06,200
Farmer Brown's boy took the two pails of milk
into the house, then out he came and started

755
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:08,200
straight for the Green Forest.

756
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:13,530
He was so curious to know what it all meant
that he couldn't wait another minute.

757
00:52:13,530 --> 00:52:17,490
Now there was some one else with a great deal
of curiosity also.

758
00:52:17,490 --> 00:52:22,703
He had heard the screaming of Blacky the Crow
and Sammy Jay, and he had listened until he

759
00:52:22,703 --> 00:52:23,703
couldn't stand it another minute.

760
00:52:23,703 --> 00:52:24,703
He just had to know what it was all about.

761
00:52:24,703 --> 00:52:30,770
So at the same time Farmer Brown's boy started
for the Green Forest, this other listener

762
00:52:30,770 --> 00:52:36,010
started towards the place where Blacky and
Sammy were making such a racket.

763
00:52:36,010 --> 00:52:40,099
He walked very softly so as not to make a
sound.

764
00:52:40,099 --> 00:52:52,160
It was Buster Bear.

765
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:55,520
CHAPTER XIII
FARMER BROWN'S BOY AND BUSTER

766
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:58,140
BEAR MEET

767
00:52:58,140 --> 00:53:00,060
If you should meet with Buster Bear

768
00:53:00,060 --> 00:53:02,310
While walking through the wood,

769
00:53:02,310 --> 00:53:03,310
What would you do?

770
00:53:03,310 --> 00:53:04,570
Now tell me true,

771
00:53:04,570 --> 00:53:08,310
I'd run the best I could.

772
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:12,980
That is what Farmer Brown's boy did when he
met Buster Bear, and a lot of the little people

773
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:17,589
of the Green Forest and some from the Green
Meadows saw him.

774
00:53:17,589 --> 00:53:21,880
When Farmer Brown's boy came hurrying home
from the Laughing Brook without any fish one

775
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:27,119
day and told about the great footprint he
had seen in a muddy place on the bank deep

776
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:32,470
in the Green Forest, and had said his was
sure that it was the footprint of a Bear,

777
00:53:32,470 --> 00:53:34,599
he had been laughed at.

778
00:53:34,599 --> 00:53:37,710
Farmer Brown had laughed and laughed.

779
00:53:37,710 --> 00:53:43,020
"Why," said he, "there hasn't been a Bear
in the Green Forest for years and years and

780
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:48,550
years, not since my own grandfather was a
little boy, and that, you know, was a long,

781
00:53:48,550 --> 00:53:50,580
long, long time ago.

782
00:53:50,580 --> 00:53:54,840
If you want to find Mr. Bear, you will have
to go to the Great Woods.

783
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:59,580
I don't know who made that footprint, but
it certainly couldn't have been a Bear.

784
00:53:59,580 --> 00:54:03,340
I think you must have imagined it."

785
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:08,910
Then he had laughed some more, all of which
goes to show how easy it is to be mistaken,

786
00:54:08,910 --> 00:54:14,500
and how foolish it is to laugh at things you
really don't know about.

787
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:20,770
Buster Bear had come to live in the Green
Forest, and Farmer Brown's boy had seen his

788
00:54:20,770 --> 00:54:21,770
footprint.

789
00:54:21,770 --> 00:54:27,359
But Farmer Brown laughed so much and made
fun of him so much, that at last his boy began

790
00:54:27,359 --> 00:54:30,870
to think that he must have been mistaken after
all.

791
00:54:30,870 --> 00:54:35,360
So when he heard Blacky the Crow and Sammy
Jay making a great fuss near the edge of the

792
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:41,660
Green Forest, he never once thought of Buster
Bear, as he started over to see what was going

793
00:54:41,660 --> 00:54:42,940
on.

794
00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:48,240
When Blacky and Sammy saw him coming, they
moved a little farther in to the Green Forest,

795
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:51,850
still screaming in the most excited way.

796
00:54:51,850 --> 00:54:56,610
They felt sure that Farmer Brown's boy would
follow them, and they meant to lead him to

797
00:54:56,610 --> 00:54:59,770
where Sammy had seen Buster Bear that morning.

798
00:54:59,770 --> 00:55:02,619
Then they would find out for sure if what

799
00:55:02,619 --> 00:55:09,010
Little Joe Otter had said was true,—that
Farmer Brown's boy really was afraid of Buster

800
00:55:09,010 --> 00:55:10,300
Bear.

801
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:17,150
Now all around, behind trees and stumps, and
under thick branches, and even in tree tops,

802
00:55:17,150 --> 00:55:23,600
were other little people watching with round,
wide-open eyes to see what would happen.

803
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:27,620
It was very exciting, the most exciting thing
they could remember.

804
00:55:27,620 --> 00:55:33,900
You see, they had come to believe that Farmer
Brown's boy wasn't afraid of anybody or anything,

805
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:38,430
and as most of them were very much afraid
of him, they had hard work to believe that

806
00:55:38,430 --> 00:55:45,300
he would really be afraid of even such a great,
big, strong fellow as Buster Bear.

807
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:51,270
Every one was so busy watching Farmer Brown's
boy that no one saw Buster coming from the

808
00:55:51,270 --> 00:55:52,980
other direction.

809
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:55,130
You see, Buster walked very softly.

810
00:55:55,130 --> 00:56:01,109
Big as he is, he can walk without making the
teeniest, weeniest sound.

811
00:56:01,109 --> 00:56:07,270
And that is how it happened that no one saw
him or heard him until just as Farmer Brown's

812
00:56:07,270 --> 00:56:14,040
boy stepped out from behind one side of a
thick little hemlock-tree, Buster Bear stepped

813
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:22,730
out from behind the other side of that same
little tree, and there they were face to face!

814
00:56:22,730 --> 00:56:28,010
Then everybody held their breath, even Blacky
the Crow and Sammy Jay.

815
00:56:28,010 --> 00:56:33,349
For just a little minute it was so still there
in the Green Forest that not the least little

816
00:56:33,349 --> 00:56:35,240
sound could be heard.

817
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:38,430
What was going to happen?

818
00:56:38,430 --> 00:56:45,960
CHAPTER XIV
A SURPRISING THING HAPPENS

819
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:51,760
Blacky the Crow and Sammy Jay, looking down
from the top of a tall tree, held their breath.

820
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:56,550
Happy Jack the Gray Squirrel and his cousin,
Chatterer the Red Squirrel, looking down from

821
00:56:56,550 --> 00:56:59,100
another tree, held their breath.

822
00:56:59,100 --> 00:57:05,320
Unc' Billy Possum, sticking his head out from
a hollow tree, held his breath.

823
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:11,660
Bobby Coon, looking through a hole in a hollow
stump in which he was hiding, held his breath.

824
00:57:11,660 --> 00:57:17,630
Reddy Fox, lying flat down behind a heap of
brush, held his breath.

825
00:57:17,630 --> 00:57:23,410
Peter Rabbit, sitting bolt upright under a
thick hemlock branch, with eyes and ears wide

826
00:57:23,410 --> 00:57:25,810
open, held his breath.

827
00:57:25,810 --> 00:57:31,630
And all the other little people who happened
to be where they could see did the same thing.

828
00:57:31,630 --> 00:57:37,030
You see, it was the most exciting moment ever
was in the Green Forest.

829
00:57:37,030 --> 00:57:41,940
Farmer Brown's boy had just stepped out from
behind one side of a little hemlock-tree and

830
00:57:41,940 --> 00:57:47,210
Buster Bear had just stepped out from behind
the opposite side of the little hemlock-tree

831
00:57:47,210 --> 00:57:51,900
and neither had known that the other was anywhere
near.

832
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:57,339
For a whole minute they stood there face to
face, gazing into each other's eyes, while

833
00:57:57,339 --> 00:58:03,510
everybody watched and waited, and it seemed
as if the whole Green Forest was holding its

834
00:58:03,510 --> 00:58:04,780
breath.

835
00:58:04,780 --> 00:58:06,640
Then something happened.

836
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:10,119
Yes, Sir, something happened.

837
00:58:10,119 --> 00:58:14,910
Farmer Brown's boy opened his mouth and yelled!

838
00:58:14,910 --> 00:58:21,130
It was such a sudden yell and such a loud
yell that it startled Chatterer so that he

839
00:58:21,130 --> 00:58:26,470
nearly fell from his place in the tree, and
it made Reddy Fox jump to his feet ready to

840
00:58:26,470 --> 00:58:27,470
run.

841
00:58:27,470 --> 00:58:30,890
And that yell was a yell of fright.

842
00:58:30,890 --> 00:58:36,900
There was no doubt about it, for with the
yell Farmer Brown's boy turned and ran for

843
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:40,790
home, as no one ever had seen him run before.

844
00:58:40,790 --> 00:58:45,470
He ran just as Peter Rabbit runs when he has
got to reach the dear Old Briar-patch before

845
00:58:45,470 --> 00:58:50,960
Reddy Fox can catch him, which, you know,
is as fast as he can run.

846
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:55,600
Once he stumbled and fell, but he scrambled
to his feet in a twinkling, and away he went

847
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:59,660
without once turning his head to see if Buster
Bear was after him.

848
00:58:59,660 --> 00:59:05,520
There wasn't any doubt that he was afraid,
very much afraid.

849
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:07,050
Everybody leaned forward to watch him.

850
00:59:07,050 --> 00:59:08,680
"What did I tell you?

851
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:11,970
Didn't I say that he was afraid of Buster
Bear?"

852
00:59:11,970 --> 00:59:14,560
cried Little Joe Otter, dancing about with
excitement.

853
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:17,119
"You were right, Little Joe!

854
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:20,490
I'm sorry that I doubted it.

855
00:59:20,490 --> 00:59:21,839
See him go!

856
00:59:21,839 --> 00:59:23,190
Caw, caw, caw!"

857
00:59:23,190 --> 00:59:28,010
shrieked Blacky the Crow.

858
00:59:28,010 --> 00:59:31,750
For a minute or two everybody forgot about
Buster Bear.

859
00:59:31,750 --> 00:59:36,970
Then there was a great crash which made everybody
turn to look the other way.

860
00:59:36,970 --> 00:59:39,370
What do you think they saw?

861
00:59:39,370 --> 00:59:44,860
Why, Buster Bear was running away too, and
he was running twice as fast as Farmer Brown's

862
00:59:44,860 --> 00:59:45,860
boy!

863
00:59:45,860 --> 00:59:51,220
He bumped into trees and crashed through bushes
and jumped over logs, and in almost no time

864
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:54,130
at all he was out of sight.

865
00:59:54,130 --> 00:59:58,250
Altogether it was the most surprising thing
that the little people of the Green Forest

866
00:59:58,250 --> 00:59:59,250
ever had seen.

867
00:59:59,250 --> 01:00:00,710
Illus Buster Bear was running away, too

868
01:00:00,710 --> 01:00:05,730
Sammy Jay looked at Blacky the Crow, and Blacky
looked at Chatterer, and Chatterer looked

869
01:00:05,730 --> 01:00:11,830
at Happy Jack, and Happy Jack looked at Peter
Rabbit, and Peter looked at Unc' Billy Possum,

870
01:00:11,830 --> 01:00:17,869
and Unc' Billy looked at Bobby Coon, and Bobby
looked at Johnny Chuck, and Johnny looked

871
01:00:17,869 --> 01:00:24,030
at Reddy Fox, and Reddy looked at Jimmy Skunk,
and Jimmy looked at Billy Mink, and Billy

872
01:00:24,030 --> 01:00:30,510
looked at Little Joe Otter, and for a minute
nobody could say a word.

873
01:00:30,510 --> 01:00:33,750
Then Little Joe gave a funny little gasp.

874
01:00:33,750 --> 01:00:41,540
"Why, why-e-e!" said he, "I believe Buster
Bear is afraid too!"

875
01:00:41,540 --> 01:00:43,619
Unc' Billy Possum chuckled.

876
01:00:43,619 --> 01:00:47,770
"Ah believe yo' are right again, Brer Otter,"
said he.

877
01:00:47,770 --> 01:00:49,839
"It cert'nly does look so.

878
01:00:49,839 --> 01:00:55,770
If Brer Bear isn't scared, he must have remembered
something impo'tant and has gone to attend

879
01:00:55,770 --> 01:00:58,980
to it in a powerful hurry."

880
01:00:58,980 --> 01:01:02,960
Then everybody began to laugh.

881
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:08,060
CHAPTER XV
BUSTER BEAR IS A FALLEN HERO

882
01:01:08,060 --> 01:01:15,220
A fallen hero is some one to whom every one
has looked up as very brave and then proves

883
01:01:15,220 --> 01:01:18,250
to be less brave than he was supposed to be.

884
01:01:18,250 --> 01:01:21,560
That was the way with Buster Bear.

885
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:27,070
When Little Joe Otter had told how Farmer
Brown's boy had been afraid at the mere sight

886
01:01:27,070 --> 01:01:32,300
of one of Buster Bear's big footprints, they
had at once made a hero of Buster.

887
01:01:32,300 --> 01:01:34,570
At least some of them had.

888
01:01:34,570 --> 01:01:40,030
As this was the first time, the very first
time, that they had ever known any one who

889
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:46,150
lives in the Green Forest to make Farmer Brown's
boy run away, they looked on Buster Bear with

890
01:01:46,150 --> 01:01:50,350
a great deal of respect and were very proud
of him.

891
01:01:50,350 --> 01:01:56,310
But now they had seen Buster Bear and Farmer
Brown's boy meet face to face; and while it

892
01:01:56,310 --> 01:02:02,290
was true that Farmer Brown's boy had run away
as fast as ever he could, it was also true

893
01:02:02,290 --> 01:02:05,530
that Buster Bear had done the same thing.

894
01:02:05,530 --> 01:02:11,140
He had run even faster than Farmer Brown's
boy, and had hidden in the most lonely place

895
01:02:11,140 --> 01:02:15,780
he could find in the very deepest part of
the Green Forest.

896
01:02:15,780 --> 01:02:19,160
It was hard to believe, but it was true.

897
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:25,070
And right away everybody lost a great deal
of the respect for Buster which they had felt.

898
01:02:25,070 --> 01:02:26,690
It is always that way.

899
01:02:26,690 --> 01:02:29,510
They began to say unkind things about him.

900
01:02:29,510 --> 01:02:34,590
They said them among themselves, and some
of them even said them to Buster when they

901
01:02:34,590 --> 01:02:38,240
met him, or said them so that he would hear
them.

902
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:43,829
Of course Blacky the Crow and Sammy Jay, who,
because they can fly, have nothing to fear

903
01:02:43,829 --> 01:02:49,640
from Buster, and who always delight in making
other people uncomfortable, never let a chance

904
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:54,829
go by to tell Buster and everybody else within
hearing what they thought of him.

905
01:02:54,829 --> 01:03:00,440
They delighted in flying about through the
Green Forest until they had found Buster Bear

906
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:04,720
and then from the safety of the tree tops
screaming at him.

907
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:08,430
"Buster Bear is big and strong;

908
01:03:08,430 --> 01:03:11,510
His teeth are big; his claws are long;

909
01:03:11,510 --> 01:03:13,359
In spite of these he runs away

910
01:03:13,359 --> 01:03:16,240
And hides himself the livelong day!"

911
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:21,480
A dozen times a day Buster would hear them
screaming this.

912
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:26,109
He would grind his teeth and glare up at them,
but that was all he could do.

913
01:03:26,109 --> 01:03:27,420
He couldn't get at them.

914
01:03:27,420 --> 01:03:30,609
He just had to stand it and do nothing.

915
01:03:30,609 --> 01:03:35,319
But when impudent little Chatterer the Red
Squirrel shouted the same thing from a place

916
01:03:35,319 --> 01:03:41,060
just out of reach in a big pine-tree, Buster
could stand it no longer.

917
01:03:41,060 --> 01:03:47,210
He gave a deep, angry growl that made little
shivers run over Chatterer, and then suddenly

918
01:03:47,210 --> 01:03:50,069
he started up that tree after Chatterer.

919
01:03:50,069 --> 01:03:54,990
With a frightened little shriek Chatterer
scampered to the top of the tree.

920
01:03:54,990 --> 01:03:57,650
He hadn't known that Buster could climb.

921
01:03:57,650 --> 01:04:02,630
But Buster is a splendid climber, especially
when the tree is big and stout as this one

922
01:04:02,630 --> 01:04:08,810
was, and now he went up after Chatterer, growling
angrily.

923
01:04:08,810 --> 01:04:13,160
How Chatterer did wish that he had kept his
tongue still!

924
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:18,130
He ran to the very top of the tree, so frightened
that his teeth chattered, and when he looked

925
01:04:18,130 --> 01:04:24,250
down and saw Buster's great mouth coming nearer
and nearer, he nearly tumbled down with terror.

926
01:04:24,250 --> 01:04:30,290
The worst of it was there wasn't another tree
near enough for him to jump to.

927
01:04:30,290 --> 01:04:34,319
He was in trouble this time, was Chatterer,
sure enough!

928
01:04:34,319 --> 01:04:40,680
And there was no one to help him.

929
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:44,369
CHAPTER XVI
CHATTERER THE RED SQUIRREL JUMPS

930
01:04:44,369 --> 01:04:46,310
FOR HIS LIFE

931
01:04:46,310 --> 01:04:50,250
It isn't very often that Chatterer the Red
Squirrel knows fear.

932
01:04:50,250 --> 01:04:53,650
That is one reason that he is so often impudent
and saucy.

933
01:04:53,650 --> 01:04:59,540
But once in a while a great fear takes possession
of him, as when he knows that Shadow the Weasel

934
01:04:59,540 --> 01:05:01,220
is looking for him.

935
01:05:01,220 --> 01:05:05,349
You see, he knows that Shadow can go wherever
he can go.

936
01:05:05,349 --> 01:05:09,670
There are very few of the little people of
the Green Forest and the Green Meadows who

937
01:05:09,670 --> 01:05:15,460
do not know fear at some time or other, but
it comes to Chatterer as seldom as to any

938
01:05:15,460 --> 01:05:22,180
one, because he is very sure of himself and
his ability to hide or run away from danger.

939
01:05:22,180 --> 01:05:27,910
But now as he clung to a little branch near
the top of a tall pine-tree in the Green Forest

940
01:05:27,910 --> 01:05:33,790
and looked down at the big sharp teeth of
Buster Bear drawing nearer and nearer, and

941
01:05:33,790 --> 01:05:40,150
listened to the deep, angry growls that made
his hair stand on end, Chatterer was too frightened

942
01:05:40,150 --> 01:05:41,500
to think.

943
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:47,280
If only he had kept his tongue still instead
of saying hateful things to Buster Bear!

944
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:50,570
If only he had known that Buster could climb
a tree!

945
01:05:50,570 --> 01:05:56,280
If only he had chosen a tree near enough to
other trees for him to jump across!

946
01:05:56,280 --> 01:06:02,609
But he had said hateful things, he had chosen
to sit in a tree which stood quite by itself,

947
01:06:02,609 --> 01:06:05,270
and Buster Bear could climb!

948
01:06:05,270 --> 01:06:11,069
Chatterer was in the worst kind of trouble,
and there was no one to blame but himself.

949
01:06:11,069 --> 01:06:15,430
That is usually the case with those who get
into trouble.

950
01:06:15,430 --> 01:06:20,930
Nearer and nearer came Buster Bear, and deeper
and angrier sounded his voice.

951
01:06:20,930 --> 01:06:26,580
Chatterer gave a little frightened gasp and
looked this way and looked that way.

952
01:06:26,580 --> 01:06:29,030
What should he do?

953
01:06:29,030 --> 01:06:30,349
What could he do!

954
01:06:30,349 --> 01:06:33,660
The ground seemed a terrible distance below.

955
01:06:33,660 --> 01:06:36,970
If only he had wings like Sammy Jay!

956
01:06:36,970 --> 01:06:40,569
But he hadn't.

957
01:06:40,569 --> 01:06:41,780
"Gr-r-r-r!"

958
01:06:41,780 --> 01:06:42,940
growled Buster Bear.

959
01:06:42,940 --> 01:06:45,250
"I'll teach you manners!

960
01:06:45,250 --> 01:06:48,690
I'll teach you to treat your betters with
respect!

961
01:06:48,690 --> 01:06:55,570
I'll swallow you whole, that's what I'll do.

962
01:06:55,570 --> 01:06:56,570
Gr-r-r-r!"

963
01:06:56,570 --> 01:06:58,930
"Oh!" cried Chatterer.

964
01:06:58,930 --> 01:07:00,400
"Gr-r-r-r!

965
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:06,480
I'll eat you all up to the last hair on your
tail!"

966
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:09,460
growled Buster, scrambling a little nearer.

967
01:07:09,460 --> 01:07:10,460
"Oh!

968
01:07:10,460 --> 01:07:16,180
Oh!" cried Chatterer, and ran out to the very
tip of the little branch to which he had been

969
01:07:16,180 --> 01:07:17,180
clinging.

970
01:07:17,180 --> 01:07:22,130
Now if Chatterer had only known it, Buster
Bear couldn't reach him way up there, because

971
01:07:22,130 --> 01:07:26,329
the tree was too small at the top for such
a big fellow as Buster.

972
01:07:26,329 --> 01:07:28,460
But Chatterer didn't think of that.

973
01:07:28,460 --> 01:07:35,510
He gave one more frightened look down at those
big teeth, then he shut his eyes and jumped—

974
01:07:35,510 --> 01:07:39,089
jumped straight out for the far-away ground.

975
01:07:39,089 --> 01:07:44,910
It was a long, long, long way down to the
ground, and it certainly looked as if such

976
01:07:44,910 --> 01:07:48,470
a little fellow as Chatterer must be killed.

977
01:07:48,470 --> 01:07:53,099
But Chatterer had learned from Old Mother
Nature that she had given him certain things

978
01:07:53,099 --> 01:08:00,240
to help him at just such times, and one of
them is the power to spread himself very flat.

979
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:01,240
He did it now.

980
01:08:01,240 --> 01:08:06,740
He spread his arms and legs out just as far
as he could, and that kept him from falling

981
01:08:06,740 --> 01:08:12,050
as fast and as hard as he otherwise would
have done, because being spread out so flat

982
01:08:12,050 --> 01:08:15,180
that way, the air held him up a little.

983
01:08:15,180 --> 01:08:21,119
And then there was his tail, that funny little
tail he is so fond of jerking when he scolds.

984
01:08:21,119 --> 01:08:22,969
This helped him too.

985
01:08:22,969 --> 01:08:27,920
It helped him keep his balance and keep from
turning over and over.

986
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:33,549
Down, down, down he sailed and landed on his
feet.

987
01:08:33,549 --> 01:08:39,609
Of course, he hit the ground pretty hard,
and for just a second he quite lost his breath.

988
01:08:39,609 --> 01:08:44,639
But it was only for a second, and then he
was scurrying off as fast as a frightened

989
01:08:44,639 --> 01:08:46,630
Squirrel could.

990
01:08:46,630 --> 01:08:49,429
Buster Bear watched him and grinned.

991
01:08:49,429 --> 01:08:56,439
"I didn't catch him that time," he growled,
"but I guess I gave him a good fright and

992
01:08:56,439 --> 01:09:10,409
taught him 
a lesson."

993
01:09:10,409 --> 01:09:16,819
CHAPTER XVII
BUSTER BEAR GOES BERRYING

994
01:09:16,819 --> 01:09:20,869
Buster Bear is a great hand to talk to himself
when he thinks no one is around to overhear.

995
01:09:20,869 --> 01:09:22,159
It's a habit.

996
01:09:22,159 --> 01:09:27,940
However, it isn't a bad habit unless it is
carried too far.

997
01:09:27,940 --> 01:09:30,939
Any habit becomes bad, if it is carried too
far.

998
01:09:30,939 --> 01:09:37,289
Suppose you had a secret, a real secret, something
that nobody else knew and that you didn't

999
01:09:37,289 --> 01:09:39,350
want anybody else to know.

1000
01:09:39,350 --> 01:09:42,239
And suppose you had the habit of talking to
yourself.

1001
01:09:42,239 --> 01:09:48,400
You might, without thinking, you know, tell
that secret out loud to yourself, and some

1002
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:51,589
one might, just might happen to overhear!

1003
01:09:51,589 --> 01:09:55,120
Then there wouldn't be any secret.

1004
01:09:55,120 --> 01:10:00,959
That is the way that a habit which isn't bad
in itself can become bad when it is carried

1005
01:10:00,959 --> 01:10:01,999
too far.

1006
01:10:01,999 --> 01:10:07,860
Now Buster Bear had lived by himself in the
Great Woods so long that this habit of talking

1007
01:10:07,860 --> 01:10:11,039
to himself had grown and grown.

1008
01:10:11,039 --> 01:10:13,150
He did it just to keep from being lonesome.

1009
01:10:13,150 --> 01:10:18,570
Of course, when he came down to the Green
Forest to live, he brought all his habits

1010
01:10:18,570 --> 01:10:19,570
with him.

1011
01:10:19,570 --> 01:10:24,679
That is one thing about habits,—you always
take them with you wherever you go.

1012
01:10:24,679 --> 01:10:30,199
So Buster brought this habit of talking to
himself down to the Green Forest, where he

1013
01:10:30,199 --> 01:10:33,769
had many more neighbors than he had in the
Great Woods.

1014
01:10:33,769 --> 01:10:43,310
"Let me see, let me see, what is there to
tempt my appetite?" said Buster in his deep,

1015
01:10:43,310 --> 01:10:45,380
grumbly-rumbly voice.

1016
01:10:45,380 --> 01:10:49,679
"I find my appetite isn't what it ought to
be.

1017
01:10:49,679 --> 01:10:51,499
I need a change.

1018
01:10:51,499 --> 01:10:54,699
Yes, Sir, I need a change.

1019
01:10:54,699 --> 01:11:00,909
There is something I ought to have at this
time of year, and I haven't got it.

1020
01:11:00,909 --> 01:11:07,590
There is something that I used to have and
don't have now.

1021
01:11:07,590 --> 01:11:09,250
Ha!

1022
01:11:09,250 --> 01:11:10,499
I know!

1023
01:11:10,499 --> 01:11:13,320
I need some fresh fruit.

1024
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:16,650
That's it—fresh fruit!

1025
01:11:16,650 --> 01:11:22,709
It must be about berry time now, and I'd forgotten
all about it.

1026
01:11:22,709 --> 01:11:27,099
My, my, my, how good some berries would taste!

1027
01:11:27,099 --> 01:11:35,030
Now if I were back up there in the Great Woods
I could have all I could eat.

1028
01:11:35,030 --> 01:11:36,030
Um-m-m-m!

1029
01:11:36,030 --> 01:11:40,110
Makes my mouth water just to think of it.

1030
01:11:40,110 --> 01:11:42,770
There ought to be some up in the Old Pasture.

1031
01:11:42,770 --> 01:11:46,010
There ought to be a lot of 'em up there.

1032
01:11:46,010 --> 01:11:51,860
If I wasn't afraid that some one would see
me, I'd go up there."

1033
01:11:51,860 --> 01:11:54,929
Buster sighed.

1034
01:11:54,929 --> 01:11:56,989
Then he sighed again.

1035
01:11:56,989 --> 01:12:03,159
The more he thought about those berries he
felt sure were growing in the Old Pasture,

1036
01:12:03,159 --> 01:12:04,679
the more he wanted some.

1037
01:12:04,679 --> 01:12:11,889
It seemed to him that never in all his life
had he wanted berries as he did now.

1038
01:12:11,889 --> 01:12:15,019
He wandered about uneasily.

1039
01:12:15,019 --> 01:12:20,570
He was hungry—hungry for berries and nothing
else.

1040
01:12:20,570 --> 01:12:23,869
By and by he began talking to himself again.

1041
01:12:23,869 --> 01:12:31,219
"If I wasn't afraid of being seen, I'd go
up to the Old Pasture this very minute.

1042
01:12:31,219 --> 01:12:35,659
Seems as if I could taste those berries."

1043
01:12:35,659 --> 01:12:38,280
He licked his lips hungrily as he spoke.

1044
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:39,840
Then his face brightened.

1045
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:41,780
"I know what I'll do!

1046
01:12:41,780 --> 01:12:46,900
I'll go up there at the very first peep of
day to-morrow.

1047
01:12:46,900 --> 01:12:54,459
I can eat all I want and get back to the Green
Forest before there is any danger that Farmer

1048
01:12:54,459 --> 01:12:58,809
Brown's boy or any one else I'm afraid of
will see me.

1049
01:12:58,809 --> 01:13:02,110
That's just what I'll do.

1050
01:13:02,110 --> 01:13:07,770
My, I wish to-morrow morning would hurry up
and come."

1051
01:13:07,770 --> 01:13:14,699
Now though Buster didn't know it, some one
had been listening, and that some one was

1052
01:13:14,699 --> 01:13:16,900
none other than Sammy Jay.

1053
01:13:16,900 --> 01:13:23,280
When at last Buster lay down for a nap, Sammy
flew away, chuckling to himself.

1054
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:28,619
"I believe I'll visit the Old Pasture to-morrow
morning myself," thought he.

1055
01:13:28,619 --> 01:13:35,969
"I have an idea that something interesting
may happen if Buster doesn't change his mind."

1056
01:13:35,969 --> 01:13:40,199
Sammy was on the lookout very early the next
morning.

1057
01:13:40,199 --> 01:13:45,150
The first Jolly Little Sunbeams had only reached
the Green Meadows and had not started to creep

1058
01:13:45,150 --> 01:13:51,070
into the Green Forest, when he saw a big,
dark form steal out of the Green Forest where

1059
01:13:51,070 --> 01:13:53,639
it joins the Old Pasture.

1060
01:13:53,639 --> 01:13:58,170
It moved very swiftly and silently, as if
in a great hurry.

1061
01:13:58,170 --> 01:14:05,239
Sammy knew who it was: it was Buster Bear,
and he was going berrying.

1062
01:14:05,239 --> 01:14:08,349
Sammy waited a little until he could see better.

1063
01:14:08,349 --> 01:14:16,449
Then he too started for the Old Pasture.

1064
01:14:16,449 --> 01:14:21,269
CHAPTER XVIII
SOMEBODY ELSE GOES BERRYING

1065
01:14:21,269 --> 01:14:27,059
Isn't it funny how two people will often think
of the same thing at the same time, and neither

1066
01:14:27,059 --> 01:14:29,920
one know that the other is thinking of it?

1067
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:34,500
That is just what happened the day that Buster
Bear first thought of going berrying.

1068
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:40,039
While he was walking around in the Green Forest,
talking to himself about how hungry he was

1069
01:14:40,039 --> 01:14:45,909
for some berries and how sure he was that
there must be some up in the Old Pasture,

1070
01:14:45,909 --> 01:14:50,380
some one else was thinking about berries and
about the Old Pasture too.

1071
01:14:50,380 --> 01:14:54,599
"Will you make me a berry pie if I will get
the berries to-morrow?"

1072
01:14:54,599 --> 01:14:58,190
asked Farmer Brown's boy of his mother.

1073
01:14:58,190 --> 01:15:03,909
Of course Mrs. Brown promised that she would,
and so that night Farmer Brown's boy went

1074
01:15:03,909 --> 01:15:09,250
to bed very early that he might get up early
in the morning, and all night long he dreamed

1075
01:15:09,250 --> 01:15:11,199
of berries and berry pies.

1076
01:15:11,199 --> 01:15:17,980
He was awake even before jolly, round, red
Mr. Sun thought it was time to get up, and

1077
01:15:17,980 --> 01:15:23,249
he was all ready to start for the Old Pasture
when the first Jolly Little Sunbeams came

1078
01:15:23,249 --> 01:15:25,880
dancing across the Green Meadows.

1079
01:15:25,880 --> 01:15:30,719
He carried a big tin pail, and in the bottom
of it, wrapped up in a piece of paper, was

1080
01:15:30,719 --> 01:15:38,199
a lunch, for he meant to stay until he filled
that pail, if it took all day.

1081
01:15:38,199 --> 01:15:40,809
Now the Old Pasture is very large.

1082
01:15:40,809 --> 01:15:46,159
It lies at the foot of the Big Mountain, and
even extends a little way up on the Big Mountain.

1083
01:15:46,159 --> 01:15:52,329
There is room in it for many people to pick
berries all day without even seeing each other,

1084
01:15:52,329 --> 01:15:54,659
unless they roam about a great deal.

1085
01:15:54,659 --> 01:16:00,130
You see, the bushes grow very thick there,
and you cannot see very far in any direction.

1086
01:16:00,130 --> 01:16:06,130
Jolly, round, red Mr. Sun had climbed a little
way up in the sky by the time Farmer Brown's

1087
01:16:06,130 --> 01:16:11,769
boy reached the Old Pasture, and was smiling
down on all the Great World, and all the Great

1088
01:16:11,769 --> 01:16:15,130
World seemed to be smiling back.

1089
01:16:15,130 --> 01:16:19,150
Farmer Brown's boy started to whistle, and
then he stopped.

1090
01:16:19,150 --> 01:16:26,650
"If I whistle," thought he, "everybody will
know just where I am, and will keep out of

1091
01:16:26,650 --> 01:16:30,829
sight, and I never can get acquainted with
folks if they keep out of sight."

1092
01:16:30,829 --> 01:16:35,760
You see, Farmer Brown's boy was just beginning
to understand something that Peter Rabbit

1093
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:40,939
and the other little people of the Green Meadows
and the Green Forest learned almost as soon

1094
01:16:40,939 --> 01:16:44,030
as they learned to walk,—that if you don't
want to

1095
01:16:44,030 --> 01:16:46,639
be seen, you mustn't be heard.

1096
01:16:46,639 --> 01:16:51,429
So he didn't whistle as he felt like doing,
and he tried not to make a bit of noise as

1097
01:16:51,429 --> 01:16:57,159
he followed an old cow-path towards a place
where he knew the berries grew thick and oh,

1098
01:16:57,159 --> 01:17:02,969
so big, and all the time he kept his eyes
wide open, and he kept his ears open too.

1099
01:17:02,969 --> 01:17:09,849
That is how he happened to hear a little cry,
a very faint little cry.

1100
01:17:09,849 --> 01:17:13,110
If he had been whistling, he wouldn't have
heard it at all.

1101
01:17:13,110 --> 01:17:14,719
He stopped to listen.

1102
01:17:14,719 --> 01:17:18,179
He never had heard a cry just like it before.

1103
01:17:18,179 --> 01:17:22,050
At first he couldn't make out just what it
was or where it came from.

1104
01:17:22,050 --> 01:17:27,860
But one thing he was sure of, and that was
that it was a cry of fright.

1105
01:17:27,860 --> 01:17:32,459
He stood perfectly still and listened with
all his might.

1106
01:17:32,459 --> 01:17:35,739
There it was again—"Help!

1107
01:17:35,739 --> 01:17:36,739
Help!

1108
01:17:36,739 --> 01:17:43,690
Help"—and it was very faint and sounded
terribly frightened.

1109
01:17:43,690 --> 01:17:46,239
He waited a minute or two, but heard nothing
more.

1110
01:17:46,239 --> 01:17:52,320
Then he put down his pail and began a hurried
look here, there, and everywhere.

1111
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:56,929
He was sure that it had come from somewhere
on the ground, so he peered behind bushes

1112
01:17:56,929 --> 01:18:03,010
and peeped behind logs and stones, and then
just as he had about given up hope of finding

1113
01:18:03,010 --> 01:18:09,119
where it came from, he went around a little
turn in the old cow-path, and there right

1114
01:18:09,119 --> 01:18:15,420
in front of him was little Mr. Gartersnake,
and what do you think he was doing?

1115
01:18:15,420 --> 01:18:23,300
Well, I don't like to tell you, but he was
trying to swallow one of the children of Stickytoes

1116
01:18:23,300 --> 01:18:24,880
the Tree Toad.

1117
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:28,239
Of course Farmer Brown's Boy didn't let him.

1118
01:18:28,239 --> 01:18:33,420
He made little Mr. Gartersnake set Master
Stickytoes free and held Mr.

1119
01:18:33,420 --> 01:18:42,610
Gartersnake until Master Stickytoes was safely
out of reach.

1120
01:18:42,610 --> 01:18:47,269
CHAPTER XIX
BUSTER BEAR HAS A FINE TIME

1121
01:18:47,269 --> 01:18:51,999
Buster Bear was having the finest time he
had had since he came down from the Great

1122
01:18:51,999 --> 01:18:54,170
Woods to live in the Green Forest.

1123
01:18:54,170 --> 01:18:59,269
To be sure, he wasn't in the Green Forest
now, but he wasn't far from it.

1124
01:18:59,269 --> 01:19:05,110
He was in the Old Pasture, one edge of which
touches one edge of the Green Forest.

1125
01:19:05,110 --> 01:19:08,130
And where do you think he was, in the Old
Pasture?

1126
01:19:08,130 --> 01:19:13,860
Why, right in the middle of the biggest patch
of the biggest blueberries he ever had seen

1127
01:19:13,860 --> 01:19:15,070
in all his life!

1128
01:19:15,070 --> 01:19:20,679
Now if there is any one thing that Buster
Bear had rather have above another, it is

1129
01:19:20,679 --> 01:19:24,429
all the berries he can eat, unless it be honey.

1130
01:19:24,429 --> 01:19:27,999
Nothing can quite equal honey in Buster's
mind.

1131
01:19:27,999 --> 01:19:31,130
But next to honey give him berries.

1132
01:19:31,130 --> 01:19:33,519
He isn't particular what kind of berries.

1133
01:19:33,519 --> 01:19:39,729
Raspberries, blackberries, or blueberries,
either kind, will make him perfectly happy.

1134
01:19:39,729 --> 01:19:49,789
"Um-m-m, my, my, but these are good!" he mumbled
in his deep grumbly-rumbly voice, as he sat

1135
01:19:49,789 --> 01:19:53,099
on his haunches stripping off the berries
greedily.

1136
01:19:53,099 --> 01:19:59,329
His little eyes twinkled with enjoyment, and
he didn't mind at all if now and then he got

1137
01:19:59,329 --> 01:20:03,969
leaves, and some green berries in his mouth
with the big ripe berries.

1138
01:20:03,969 --> 01:20:05,690
He didn't try to get them out.

1139
01:20:05,690 --> 01:20:07,329
Oh, my, no!

1140
01:20:07,329 --> 01:20:12,729
He just chomped them all up together and patted
his stomach from sheer delight.

1141
01:20:12,729 --> 01:20:18,199
Now Buster had reached the Old Pasture just
as jolly, round, red Mr. Sun had crept out

1142
01:20:18,199 --> 01:20:23,189
of bed, and he had fully made up his mind
that he would be back in the Green Forest

1143
01:20:23,189 --> 01:20:28,510
before Mr. Sun had climbed very far up in
the blue, blue sky.

1144
01:20:28,510 --> 01:20:35,570
You see, big as he is and strong as he is,
Buster Bear is very shy and bashful, and he

1145
01:20:35,570 --> 01:20:42,559
has no desire to meet Farmer Brown, or Farmer
Brown's boy, or any other of those two-legged

1146
01:20:42,559 --> 01:20:45,159
creatures called men.

1147
01:20:45,159 --> 01:20:48,230
It seems funny but he actually is afraid of
them.

1148
01:20:48,230 --> 01:20:53,119
And he had a feeling that he was a great deal
more likely to meet one of them in the Old

1149
01:20:53,119 --> 01:20:56,739
Pasture than deep in the Green Forest.

1150
01:20:56,739 --> 01:21:01,179
So when he started to look for berries, he
made up his mind that he would eat what he

1151
01:21:01,179 --> 01:21:06,599
could in a great hurry and get back to the
Green Forest before Farmer Brown's boy was

1152
01:21:06,599 --> 01:21:08,239
more than out of bed.

1153
01:21:08,239 --> 01:21:14,429
But when he found those berries he was so
hungry that he forgot his fears and everything

1154
01:21:14,429 --> 01:21:15,429
else.

1155
01:21:15,429 --> 01:21:20,630
They tasted so good that he just had to eat
and eat and eat.

1156
01:21:20,630 --> 01:21:26,489
Now you know that Buster is a very big fellow,
and it takes a lot to fill him up.

1157
01:21:26,489 --> 01:21:30,219
He kept eating and eating and eating, and
the

1158
01:21:30,219 --> 01:21:33,300
more he ate the more he wanted.

1159
01:21:33,300 --> 01:21:34,829
You know how it is.

1160
01:21:34,829 --> 01:21:40,599
So he wandered from one patch of berries to
another in the Old Pasture, and never once

1161
01:21:40,599 --> 01:21:41,599
thought of the time.

1162
01:21:41,599 --> 01:21:47,489
Somehow, time is the hardest thing in the
world to remember, when you are having a good

1163
01:21:47,489 --> 01:21:48,670
time.

1164
01:21:48,670 --> 01:21:55,239
Jolly, round, red Mr. Sun climbed higher and
higher in the blue, blue sky.

1165
01:21:55,239 --> 01:22:00,689
He looked down on all the Great World and
saw all that was going on.

1166
01:22:00,689 --> 01:22:06,650
He saw Buster Bear in the Old Pasture, and
smiled as he saw what a perfectly glorious

1167
01:22:06,650 --> 01:22:09,250
time Buster was having.

1168
01:22:09,250 --> 01:22:15,099
And he saw something else in the Old Pasture
that made his smile still broader.

1169
01:22:15,099 --> 01:22:20,780
He saw Farmer Brown's boy filling a great
tin pail with blueberries, and he knew that

1170
01:22:20,780 --> 01:22:26,889
Farmer Brown's boy didn't know that Buster
Bear was anywhere about, and he knew that

1171
01:22:26,889 --> 01:22:33,340
Buster Bear didn't know that Farmer Brown's
boy was anywhere about, and somehow he felt

1172
01:22:33,340 --> 01:22:39,809
very sure that he would see something funny
happen if they should chance to meet.

1173
01:22:39,809 --> 01:22:47,389
"Um-m-m, um-m-m," mumbled Buster Bear with
his mouth full, as he moved along to another

1174
01:22:47,389 --> 01:22:48,909
patch of berries.

1175
01:22:48,909 --> 01:22:52,679
And then he gave a little gasp of surprise
and delight.

1176
01:22:52,679 --> 01:22:58,920
Right in front of him was a shiny thing just
full of the finest, biggest, bluest berries!

1177
01:22:58,920 --> 01:23:03,679
There were no leaves or green ones there.

1178
01:23:03,679 --> 01:23:07,959
Buster blinked his greedy little eyes rapidly
and looked again.

1179
01:23:07,959 --> 01:23:10,599
No, he wasn't dreaming.

1180
01:23:10,599 --> 01:23:15,689
They were real berries, and all he had got
to do was to help himself.

1181
01:23:15,689 --> 01:23:19,419
Buster looked sharply at the shiny thing that
held the berries.

1182
01:23:19,419 --> 01:23:20,940
It seemed perfectly harmless.

1183
01:23:20,940 --> 01:23:25,429
He reached out a big paw and pushed it gently.

1184
01:23:25,429 --> 01:23:29,099
It tipped over and spilled out a lot of the
berries.

1185
01:23:29,099 --> 01:23:32,749
Yes, it was perfectly harmless.

1186
01:23:32,749 --> 01:23:35,489
Buster gave a little sigh of pure happiness.

1187
01:23:35,489 --> 01:23:43,260
He would eat those berries to the last one,
and then he would go home to the Green Forest.

1188
01:23:43,260 --> 01:23:49,229
CHAPTER XX
BUSTER BEAR CARRIES OFF THE PAIL

1189
01:23:49,229 --> 01:23:51,909
OF FARMER BROWN'S BOY

1190
01:23:51,909 --> 01:23:56,940
The question is, did Buster Bear steal Farmer
Brown's boy's pail?

1191
01:23:56,940 --> 01:24:01,780
To steal is to take something which belongs
to some one else.

1192
01:24:01,780 --> 01:24:06,239
There is no doubt that he stole the berries
that were in the pail when he found it, for

1193
01:24:06,239 --> 01:24:08,389
he deliberately ate them.

1194
01:24:08,389 --> 01:24:13,449
He knew well enough that some one must have
picked them—for whoever heard of blueberries

1195
01:24:13,449 --> 01:24:15,239
growing in tin pails?

1196
01:24:15,239 --> 01:24:21,380
So there is no doubt that when Buster took
them, he stole them.

1197
01:24:21,380 --> 01:24:23,880
But with the pail it was different.

1198
01:24:23,880 --> 01:24:27,179
He took the pail, but he didn't mean to take
it.

1199
01:24:27,179 --> 01:24:32,030
In fact, he didn't want that pail at all.

1200
01:24:32,030 --> 01:24:39,019
You see it was this way: When Buster found
that big tin pail brimming full of delicious

1201
01:24:39,019 --> 01:24:45,239
berries in the shade of that big bush in the
Old Pasture, he didn't stop to think whether

1202
01:24:45,239 --> 01:24:47,429
or not he had a right to them.

1203
01:24:47,429 --> 01:24:53,159
Buster is so fond of berries that from the
very second that his greedy little eyes saw

1204
01:24:53,159 --> 01:24:58,840
that pailful, he forgot everything but the
feast that was waiting for him right under

1205
01:24:58,840 --> 01:25:01,030
his very nose.

1206
01:25:01,030 --> 01:25:06,169
He didn't think anything about the right or
wrong of helping himself.

1207
01:25:06,169 --> 01:25:10,900
There before him were more berries than he
had ever seen together at one time in all

1208
01:25:10,900 --> 01:25:16,590
his life, and all he had to do was to eat
and eat and eat.

1209
01:25:16,590 --> 01:25:19,750
And that is just what he did do.

1210
01:25:19,750 --> 01:25:24,679
Of course he upset the pail, but he didn't
mind a little thing like that.

1211
01:25:24,679 --> 01:25:29,579
When he had gobbled up all the berries that
rolled out, he thrust his nose into the pail

1212
01:25:29,579 --> 01:25:32,059
to get all that were left in it.

1213
01:25:32,059 --> 01:25:37,360
Just then he heard a little noise, as if some
one were coming.

1214
01:25:37,360 --> 01:25:44,579
He threw up his head to listen, and somehow,
he never did know just how, the handle of

1215
01:25:44,579 --> 01:25:48,849
the pail slipped back over his ears and caught
there.

1216
01:25:48,849 --> 01:25:56,300
This was bad enough, but to make matters worse,
just at that very minute he heard a shrill,

1217
01:25:56,300 --> 01:25:59,500
angry voice shout, "Hi, there!

1218
01:25:59,500 --> 01:26:01,989
Get out of there!"

1219
01:26:01,989 --> 01:26:04,360
He didn't need to be told whose voice that
was.

1220
01:26:04,360 --> 01:26:07,729
It was the voice of Farmer Brown's boy.

1221
01:26:07,729 --> 01:26:11,449
Right then and there Buster Bear nearly had
a fit.

1222
01:26:11,449 --> 01:26:15,780
There was that awful pail fast over his head
so that he couldn't see a thing.

1223
01:26:15,780 --> 01:26:20,289
Of course, that meant that he couldn't run
away, which was the thing of all things he

1224
01:26:20,289 --> 01:26:27,499
most wanted to do, for big as he is and strong
as he is, Buster is very shy and bashful when

1225
01:26:27,499 --> 01:26:29,789
human beings are around.

1226
01:26:29,789 --> 01:26:33,600
He growled and whined and squealed.

1227
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:36,360
He tried to back out of the pail and couldn't.

1228
01:26:36,360 --> 01:26:39,100
He tried to shake it off and couldn't.

1229
01:26:39,100 --> 01:26:41,479
He tried to pull it off, but somehow

1230
01:26:41,479 --> 01:26:43,559
he couldn't get hold of it.

1231
01:26:43,559 --> 01:26:46,829
Then there was another yell.

1232
01:26:46,829 --> 01:26:51,269
If Buster hadn't been so frightened himself,
he might have recognized that second yell

1233
01:26:51,269 --> 01:26:54,780
as one of fright, for that is what it was.

1234
01:26:54,780 --> 01:26:59,340
You see Farmer Brown's boy had just discovered
Buster Bear.

1235
01:26:59,340 --> 01:27:03,429
When he had yelled the first time, he had
supposed that it was one of the young cattle

1236
01:27:03,429 --> 01:27:09,949
who live in the Old Pasture all summer, but
when he saw Buster, he was just as badly frightened

1237
01:27:09,949 --> 01:27:11,110
as Buster himself.

1238
01:27:11,110 --> 01:27:16,469
In fact, he was too surprised and frightened
even to run.

1239
01:27:16,469 --> 01:27:22,300
After that second yell he just stood still
and stared.

1240
01:27:22,300 --> 01:27:26,610
Buster clawed at that awful thing on his head
more frantically than ever.

1241
01:27:26,610 --> 01:27:30,449
Suddenly it slipped off, so that he could
see.

1242
01:27:30,449 --> 01:27:38,889
He gave one frightened look at Farmer Brown's
boy, and then with a mighty "Woof!" he started

1243
01:27:38,889 --> 01:27:44,829
for the Green Forest as fast as his legs could
take him, and this was very fast indeed, let

1244
01:27:44,829 --> 01:27:46,090
me tell you.

1245
01:27:46,090 --> 01:27:50,849
He didn't stop to pick out a path, but just
crashed through the bushes as if they were

1246
01:27:50,849 --> 01:27:52,969
nothing at all, just nothing at all.

1247
01:27:52,969 --> 01:27:57,530
But the funniest thing of all is this—

1248
01:27:57,530 --> 01:27:59,579
he took that pail with him!

1249
01:27:59,579 --> 01:28:04,939
Yes, Sir, Buster Bear ran away with the big
tin pail of Farmer Brown's boy!

1250
01:28:04,939 --> 01:28:10,679
You see when it slipped off his head, the
handle was still around his neck, and there

1251
01:28:10,679 --> 01:28:15,510
he was running away with a pail hanging from
his neck!

1252
01:28:15,510 --> 01:28:17,090
He didn't want it.

1253
01:28:17,090 --> 01:28:19,919
He would have given anything to get rid of
it.

1254
01:28:19,919 --> 01:28:22,739
But he took it because he couldn't help it.

1255
01:28:22,739 --> 01:28:30,050
And that brings us back to the question, did
Buster steal Farmer Brown's boy's pail?

1256
01:28:30,050 --> 01:28:44,729
What do you think?

1257
01:28:44,729 --> 01:28:48,119
CHAPTER XXI
SAMMY JAY MAKES THINGS WORSE

1258
01:28:48,119 --> 01:28:49,119
FOR BUSTER BEAR

1259
01:28:49,119 --> 01:28:51,959
"Thief, thief, thief!

1260
01:28:51,959 --> 01:28:55,150
Thief, thief, thief!"

1261
01:28:55,150 --> 01:28:59,499
Sammy Jay was screaming at the top of his
lungs, as he followed Buster Bear across the

1262
01:28:59,499 --> 01:29:02,250
Old Pasture towards the Green Forest.

1263
01:29:02,250 --> 01:29:07,719
Never had he screamed so loud, and never had
his voice sounded so excited.

1264
01:29:07,719 --> 01:29:12,610
The little people of the Green Forest, the
Green Meadows, and the Smiling Pool are so

1265
01:29:12,610 --> 01:29:17,769
used to hearing Sammy cry thief that usually
they think very little about it.

1266
01:29:17,769 --> 01:29:24,099
But every blessed one who heard Sammy this
morning stopped whatever he was doing and

1267
01:29:24,099 --> 01:29:26,170
pricked up his ears to listen.

1268
01:29:26,170 --> 01:29:33,170
Sammy's cousin, Blacky the Crow, just happened
to be flying along the edge of the Old Pasture,

1269
01:29:33,170 --> 01:29:37,619
and the minute he heard Sammy's voice, he
turned and flew over to see what it was all

1270
01:29:37,619 --> 01:29:38,619
about.

1271
01:29:38,619 --> 01:29:42,739
Just as soon as he caught sight of Buster
Bear running for the Green Forest as hard

1272
01:29:42,739 --> 01:29:47,300
as ever he could, he understood what had excited
Sammy so.

1273
01:29:47,300 --> 01:29:52,080
He was so surprised that he almost forgot
to keep his wings moving.

1274
01:29:52,080 --> 01:29:58,579
Buster Bear had what looked to Blacky very
much like a tin pail hanging from his neck!

1275
01:29:58,579 --> 01:30:01,060
No wonder Sammy was excited.

1276
01:30:01,060 --> 01:30:05,960
Blacky beat his wings fiercely and started
after Sammy.

1277
01:30:05,960 --> 01:30:10,590
And so they reached the edge of the Green
Forest, Buster Bear running as hard as ever

1278
01:30:10,590 --> 01:30:16,539
he could, Sammy Jay flying just behind him
and screaming, "Thief, thief, thief!"

1279
01:30:16,539 --> 01:30:22,639
at the top of his lungs, and behind him Blacky
the Crow, trying to catch up and yelling as

1280
01:30:22,639 --> 01:30:26,659
loud as he could, "Caw, caw, caw!

1281
01:30:26,659 --> 01:30:29,110
Come on, everybody!

1282
01:30:29,110 --> 01:30:30,749
Come on!

1283
01:30:30,749 --> 01:30:32,380
Come on!"

1284
01:30:32,380 --> 01:30:34,019
Poor Buster!

1285
01:30:34,019 --> 01:30:39,010
It was bad enough to be frightened almost
to death as he had been up in the Old Pasture

1286
01:30:39,010 --> 01:30:43,969
when the pail had caught over his head just
as Farmer Brown's boy had yelled at him.

1287
01:30:43,969 --> 01:30:49,960
Then to have the handle of the pail slip down
around his neck so that he couldn't get rid

1288
01:30:49,960 --> 01:30:56,189
of the pail but had to take it with him as
he ran, was making a bad matter worse.

1289
01:30:56,189 --> 01:31:01,969
Now to have all his neighbors of the Green
Forest see him in such a fix and make fun

1290
01:31:01,969 --> 01:31:05,400
of him, was more than he could stand.

1291
01:31:05,400 --> 01:31:08,979
He felt humiliated.

1292
01:31:08,979 --> 01:31:11,460
That is just another way of saying shamed.

1293
01:31:11,460 --> 01:31:17,559
Yes, Sir, Buster felt that he was shamed in
the eyes of his neighbors, and he wanted nothing

1294
01:31:17,559 --> 01:31:22,249
so much as to get away by himself, where no
one could see him, and try

1295
01:31:22,249 --> 01:31:25,119
to get rid of that dreadful pail.

1296
01:31:25,119 --> 01:31:29,159
But Buster is so big that it is not easy for
him to find a hiding place.

1297
01:31:29,159 --> 01:31:35,999
So, when he reached the Green Forest, he kept
right on to the deepest, darkest, most lonesome

1298
01:31:35,999 --> 01:31:41,559
part and crept under the thickest hemlock-tree
he could find.

1299
01:31:41,559 --> 01:31:43,760
But it was of no use.

1300
01:31:43,760 --> 01:31:47,179
The sharp eyes of Sammy Jay and Blacky the
Crow saw him.

1301
01:31:47,179 --> 01:31:52,939
They actually flew into the very tree under
which he was hiding, and how they did scream!

1302
01:31:52,939 --> 01:31:59,939
Pretty soon Ol' Mistah Buzzard came dropping
down out of the blue, blue sky and took a

1303
01:31:59,939 --> 01:32:04,239
seat on a convenient dead tree, where he could
see all that went on.

1304
01:32:04,239 --> 01:32:10,189
Ol' Mistah Buzzard began to grin as soon as
he saw that tin pail on Buster's neck.

1305
01:32:10,189 --> 01:32:16,790
Then came others,—Redtail the Hawk, Scrapper
the Kingbird, Redwing the Blackbird, Drummer

1306
01:32:16,790 --> 01:32:24,530
the Woodpecker, Welcome Robin, Tommy Tit the
Chickadee, Jenny Wren, Redeye the Vireo, and

1307
01:32:24,530 --> 01:32:26,119
ever so many more.

1308
01:32:26,119 --> 01:32:31,320
They came from the Old Orchard, the Green
Meadows, and even down by the Smiling Pool,

1309
01:32:31,320 --> 01:32:36,789
for the voices of Sammy Jay and Blacky the
Crow carried far, and at the sound of them

1310
01:32:36,789 --> 01:32:41,760
everybody hurried over, sure that something
exciting was going on.

1311
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:48,800
Presently Buster heard light footsteps, and
peeping out, he saw Billy Mink and Peter Rabbit

1312
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:55,169
and Jumper the Hare and Prickly Porky and
Reddy Fox and Jimmy Skunk.

1313
01:32:55,169 --> 01:33:00,010
Even timid little Whitefoot the Wood Mouse
was where he could peer out and see without

1314
01:33:00,010 --> 01:33:01,909
being seen.

1315
01:33:01,909 --> 01:33:05,890
Of course, Chatterer the Red Squirrel and
Happy Jack the Gray Squirrel were there.

1316
01:33:05,890 --> 01:33:11,969
There they all sat in a great circle around
him, each where he felt safe, but where he

1317
01:33:11,969 --> 01:33:18,460
could see, and every one of them laughing
and making fun of Buster.

1318
01:33:18,460 --> 01:33:21,780
"Thief, thief, thief!"

1319
01:33:21,780 --> 01:33:24,520
screamed Sammy until his throat was sore.

1320
01:33:24,520 --> 01:33:29,449
The worst of it was Buster knew that everybody
knew that it was true.

1321
01:33:29,449 --> 01:33:32,949
That awful pail was proof of it.

1322
01:33:32,949 --> 01:33:41,369
"I wish I never had thought of berries," growled
Buster to himself.

1323
01:33:41,369 --> 01:33:47,739
CHAPTER XXII
BUSTER BEAR HAS A FIT OF TEMPER

1324
01:33:47,739 --> 01:33:50,869
A temper is a bad, bad thing

1325
01:33:50,869 --> 01:33:52,280
When once it gets away.

1326
01:33:52,280 --> 01:33:54,619
There's nothing quite at all like it

1327
01:33:54,619 --> 01:33:58,380
To spoil a pleasant day.

1328
01:33:58,380 --> 01:34:00,619
Buster Bear was in a terrible temper.

1329
01:34:00,619 --> 01:34:06,639
Yes, Sir, Buster Bear was having the worst
fit of temper ever seen in the Green Forest.

1330
01:34:06,639 --> 01:34:11,539
And the worst part of it all was that all
his neighbors of the Green Forest and a whole

1331
01:34:11,539 --> 01:34:17,449
lot from the Green Meadows and the Smiling
Pool were also there to see it.

1332
01:34:17,449 --> 01:34:21,939
It is bad enough to give way to temper when
you are all alone, and there is no one to

1333
01:34:21,939 --> 01:34:27,770
watch you, but when you let temper get the
best of you right where others see you, oh,

1334
01:34:27,770 --> 01:34:31,769
dear, dear, it certainly is a sorry sight.

1335
01:34:31,769 --> 01:34:36,909
Now ordinarily Buster is one of the most good-natured
persons in the world.

1336
01:34:36,909 --> 01:34:40,110
It takes a great deal to rouse his temper.

1337
01:34:40,110 --> 01:34:46,619
He isn't one tenth so quick tempered as Chatterer
the Red Squirrel, or Sammy Jay, or Reddy Fox.

1338
01:34:46,619 --> 01:34:52,369
But when his temper is aroused and gets away
from him, then watch out!

1339
01:34:52,369 --> 01:34:57,639
It seemed to Buster that he had had all that
he could stand that day and a little more.

1340
01:34:57,639 --> 01:35:01,290
First had come the fright back there in the
Old Pasture.

1341
01:35:01,290 --> 01:35:06,619
Then the pail had slipped down behind his
ears and held fast, so he had run all the

1342
01:35:06,619 --> 01:35:09,849
way to the Green Forest with it hanging about
his neck.

1343
01:35:09,849 --> 01:35:15,999
This was bad enough, for he knew just how
funny he must look, and besides, it was very

1344
01:35:15,999 --> 01:35:17,729
uncomfortable.

1345
01:35:17,729 --> 01:35:23,540
But to have Sammy Jay call everybody within
hearing to come and see him was more than

1346
01:35:23,540 --> 01:35:24,969
he could stand.

1347
01:35:24,969 --> 01:35:30,300
It seemed to Buster as if everybody who lives
in the Green Forest, on the Green Meadows,

1348
01:35:30,300 --> 01:35:36,679
or around the Smiling Brook, was sitting around
his hiding place, laughing and making fun

1349
01:35:36,679 --> 01:35:38,170
of him.

1350
01:35:38,170 --> 01:35:42,649
It was more than any self-respecting Bear
could stand.

1351
01:35:42,649 --> 01:35:47,380
With a roar of anger Buster Bear charged out
of his hiding place.

1352
01:35:47,380 --> 01:35:49,289
He rushed this way and that way!

1353
01:35:49,289 --> 01:35:51,869
He roared with all his might!

1354
01:35:51,869 --> 01:35:54,599
He was very terrible to see.

1355
01:35:54,599 --> 01:35:56,189
Those who could fly, flew.

1356
01:35:56,189 --> 01:35:59,630
Those who could climb, climbed.

1357
01:35:59,630 --> 01:36:02,169
And those who were swift of foot, ran.

1358
01:36:02,169 --> 01:36:08,469
A few who could neither fly nor climb nor
run fast, hid and lay shaking and trembling

1359
01:36:08,469 --> 01:36:10,729
for fear that Buster would find them.

1360
01:36:10,729 --> 01:36:14,889
In less time than it takes to tell about it,
Buster was alone.

1361
01:36:14,889 --> 01:36:16,673
At least, he couldn't see any one.

1362
01:36:16,673 --> 01:36:17,673
Illus Those who could fly, flew.

1363
01:36:17,673 --> 01:36:19,480
Those who could climb, climbed.

1364
01:36:19,480 --> 01:36:22,460
Then he vented his temper on the tin pail.

1365
01:36:22,460 --> 01:36:27,719
He cuffed at it and pulled at it, all the
time growling angrily.

1366
01:36:27,719 --> 01:36:31,309
He lay down and clawed at it with his hind
feet.

1367
01:36:31,309 --> 01:36:35,409
At last the handle broke, and he was free!

1368
01:36:35,409 --> 01:36:37,960
He shook himself.

1369
01:36:37,960 --> 01:36:40,590
Then he jumped on the helpless pail.

1370
01:36:40,590 --> 01:36:45,630
With a blow of a big paw he sent it clattering
against a tree.

1371
01:36:45,630 --> 01:36:47,579
He tried to bite it.

1372
01:36:47,579 --> 01:36:54,619
Then he once more fell to knocking it this
way and that way, until it was pounded flat,

1373
01:36:54,619 --> 01:36:59,790
and no one would ever have guessed that it
had once been a pail.

1374
01:36:59,790 --> 01:37:06,690
Then, and not till then, did Buster recover
his usual good nature.

1375
01:37:06,690 --> 01:37:12,769
Little by little, as he thought it all over,
a look of shame crept into his face.

1376
01:37:12,769 --> 01:37:18,040
"I—I guess it wasn't the fault of that thing.

1377
01:37:18,040 --> 01:37:23,420
I ought to have known enough to keep my head
out of it,"

1378
01:37:23,420 --> 01:37:25,860
he said slowly and thoughtfully.

1379
01:37:25,860 --> 01:37:31,270
"You got no more than you deserve for stealing
Farmer Brown's boy's berries,"

1380
01:37:31,270 --> 01:37:36,110
said Sammy Jay, who had come back and was
looking on from the top of a tree.

1381
01:37:36,110 --> 01:37:43,269
"You ought to know by this time that no good
comes of stealing."

1382
01:37:43,269 --> 01:37:47,689
Buster Bear looked up and grinned, and there
was a twinkle in his eyes.

1383
01:37:47,689 --> 01:37:51,909
"You ought to know, Sammy Jay," said he.

1384
01:37:51,909 --> 01:37:55,189
"I hope you'll always remember it."

1385
01:37:55,189 --> 01:37:57,619
"Thief, thief, thief!"

1386
01:37:57,619 --> 01:38:01,889
screamed Sammy, and flew away.

1387
01:38:01,889 --> 01:38:08,899
CHAPTER XXIII
FARMER BROWN'S BOY LUNCHES ON

1388
01:38:08,899 --> 01:38:10,399
BERRIES

1389
01:38:10,399 --> 01:38:12,570
When things go wrong in spite of you

1390
01:38:12,570 --> 01:38:15,239
To smile's the best thing you can do—

1391
01:38:15,239 --> 01:38:18,630
To smile and say, "I'm mighty glad

1392
01:38:18,630 --> 01:38:23,479
They are no worse; they're not so bad!"

1393
01:38:23,479 --> 01:38:28,419
That is what Farmer Brown's boy said when
he found that Buster Bear had stolen the berries

1394
01:38:28,419 --> 01:38:32,530
he had worked so hard to pick and then had
run off with the pail.

1395
01:38:32,530 --> 01:38:38,189
You see, Farmer Brown's boy is learning to
be something of a philosopher, one of those

1396
01:38:38,189 --> 01:38:43,650
people who accept bad things cheerfully and
right away see how they are better than they

1397
01:38:43,650 --> 01:38:44,959
might have been.

1398
01:38:44,959 --> 01:38:50,420
When he had first heard some one in the bushes
where he had hidden his pail of berries, he

1399
01:38:50,420 --> 01:38:55,159
had been very sure that it was one of the
cows or young cattle who live in the Old Pasture

1400
01:38:55,159 --> 01:38:56,810
during the summer.

1401
01:38:56,810 --> 01:39:01,919
He had been afraid that they might stupidly
kick over the pail and spill the berries,

1402
01:39:01,919 --> 01:39:05,949
and he had hurried to drive whoever it was
away.

1403
01:39:05,949 --> 01:39:09,710
It hadn't entered his head that it could be
anybody who would eat those berries.

1404
01:39:09,710 --> 01:39:14,929
When he had yelled and Buster Bear had suddenly
appeared, struggling to get off the pail which

1405
01:39:14,929 --> 01:39:20,770
had caught over his head, Farmer Brown's boy
had been too frightened to even move.

1406
01:39:20,770 --> 01:39:26,389
Then he had seen Buster tear away through
the brush even more frightened than he was,

1407
01:39:26,389 --> 01:39:30,019
and right away his courage had begun to come
back.

1408
01:39:30,019 --> 01:39:36,249
"If he is so afraid of me, I guess I needn't
be afraid of him," said he.

1409
01:39:36,249 --> 01:39:42,030
"I've lost my berries, but it is worth it
to find out that he is afraid of me.

1410
01:39:42,030 --> 01:39:47,539
There are plenty more on the bushes, and all
I've got to do is to pick them.

1411
01:39:47,539 --> 01:39:49,829
It might be worse."

1412
01:39:49,829 --> 01:39:54,429
He walked over to the place where the pail
had been, and then he remembered that when

1413
01:39:54,429 --> 01:39:58,789
Buster ran away he had carried the pail with
him, hanging about his neck.

1414
01:39:58,789 --> 01:39:59,789
He whistled.

1415
01:39:59,789 --> 01:40:06,550
It was a comical little whistle of chagrin
as he realized that he had nothing in which

1416
01:40:06,550 --> 01:40:09,559
to put more berries, even if he picked them.

1417
01:40:09,559 --> 01:40:12,630
"It's worse than I thought," cried he.

1418
01:40:12,630 --> 01:40:17,269
"That bear has cheated me out of that berry
pie my mother promised me."

1419
01:40:17,269 --> 01:40:21,409
Then he began to laugh, as he thought of how
funny

1420
01:40:21,409 --> 01:40:27,149
Buster Bear had looked with the pail about
his neck, and then because, you know he is

1421
01:40:27,149 --> 01:40:32,979
learning to be a philosopher, he once more
repeated, "It might have been worse.

1422
01:40:32,979 --> 01:40:36,550
Yes, indeed, it might have been worse.

1423
01:40:36,550 --> 01:40:40,749
That bear might have tried to eat me instead
of the berries.

1424
01:40:40,749 --> 01:40:46,070
I guess I'll go eat that lunch I left back
by the spring, and then I'll go home.

1425
01:40:46,070 --> 01:40:49,480
I can pick berries some other day."

1426
01:40:49,480 --> 01:40:55,360
Chuckling happily over Buster Bear's great
fright, Farmer Brown's boy tramped back to

1427
01:40:55,360 --> 01:41:00,769
the spring where he had left two thick sandwiches
on a flat stone when he started to save his

1428
01:41:00,769 --> 01:41:01,969
pail of berries.

1429
01:41:01,969 --> 01:41:05,110
"My, but those sandwiches will taste good,"

1430
01:41:05,110 --> 01:41:06,110
thought he.

1431
01:41:06,110 --> 01:41:08,260
"I'm glad they are big and thick.

1432
01:41:08,260 --> 01:41:11,789
I never was hungrier in my life.

1433
01:41:11,789 --> 01:41:13,110
Hello!"

1434
01:41:13,110 --> 01:41:19,729
This he exclaimed right out loud, for he had
just come in sight of the flat stone where

1435
01:41:19,729 --> 01:41:23,320
the sandwiches should have been, and they
were not there.

1436
01:41:23,320 --> 01:41:30,780
No, Sir, there wasn't so much as a crumb left
of those two thick sandwiches.

1437
01:41:30,780 --> 01:41:38,060
You see, Old Man Coyote had found them and
gobbled them up while Farmer Brown's boy was

1438
01:41:38,060 --> 01:41:39,679
away.

1439
01:41:39,679 --> 01:41:43,840
But Farmer Brown's boy didn't know anything
about Old Man Coyote.

1440
01:41:43,840 --> 01:41:48,479
He rubbed his eyes and stared everywhere,
even up in the trees, as if he thought those

1441
01:41:48,479 --> 01:41:51,619
sandwiches might be hanging up there.

1442
01:41:51,619 --> 01:41:56,699
They had disappeared as completely as if they
never had been, and Old Man Coyote had taken

1443
01:41:56,699 --> 01:42:00,709
care to leave no trace of his visit.

1444
01:42:00,709 --> 01:42:05,290
Farmer Brown's boy gaped foolishly this way
and that way.

1445
01:42:05,290 --> 01:42:12,189
Then, instead of growing angry, a slow smile
stole over his freckled face.

1446
01:42:12,189 --> 01:42:17,070
"I guess some one else was hungry too," he
muttered.

1447
01:42:17,070 --> 01:42:19,550
"Wonder who it was?

1448
01:42:19,550 --> 01:42:22,019
Guess this Old Pasture is no place for me
to-day.

1449
01:42:22,019 --> 01:42:26,619
I'll fill up on berries and then I'll go home."

1450
01:42:26,619 --> 01:42:32,949
So Farmer Brown's boy made his lunch on blueberries
and then rather sheepishly he started for

1451
01:42:32,949 --> 01:42:37,439
home to tell of all the strange things that
had happened to him in the Old Pasture.

1452
01:42:37,439 --> 01:42:43,389
Two or three times, as he trudged along, he
stopped to scratch his head thoughtfully.

1453
01:42:43,389 --> 01:42:51,110
"I guess," said he at last, "that I'm not
so smart as I thought I was, and I've got

1454
01:42:51,110 --> 01:42:52,749
a lot to learn yet."

1455
01:42:52,749 --> 01:43:00,599
This is the end of the adventures of Buster
Bear in this book because—guess why.

1456
01:43:00,599 --> 01:43:07,030
Because Old Mr. Toad insists that I must write
a book about his adventures, and Old Mr. Toad

1457
01:43:07,030 --> 01:43:23,739
is such a good friend of all of us that I
am going to do it.

1458
01:43:23,739 --> 01:43:27,049
- THE END -
