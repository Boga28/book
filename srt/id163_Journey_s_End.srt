1
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:10,960
Tom Smith was a nice young man. He 
wanted a job, but he couldn't find one.  

2
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:19,200
Many people wanted to work, and 
there weren't many jobs. Tom felt sad  

3
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,960
because he never had money 
for clothes or the cinema.

4
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:31,680
When he was younger, Tom wanted to be 
a footballer. He was good at football,  

5
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:40,320
and at tennis, too. He was good at every 
sport. But there were other, better players.

6
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:50,320
Now Tom had a new idea. He thought, 
'Perhaps I can find a job in a sports shop.  

7
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:59,680
I'll be happy then and I'll have money.' 
But it was only an idea. It never happened.

8
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,000
He tried hard to find a job. 
He looked in the newspapers  

9
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:14,400
every day and he wrote letters for jobs - 
a lot of letters. But he never found a job.

10
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:22,720
One day he saw something in the newspaper 
about a fair in the park near his house.

11
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:30,320
'That will be interesting,' he thought. 
'It's next Saturday. I think I'll go.  

12
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:39,840
Yes, I'll go. I'm not doing anything 
this weekend, and it won't cost much.'

13
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:45,200
On Saturday Tom walked to the park 
and bought a ticket for the fair.  

14
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:53,840
It was a warm summer day The sky was 
blue, and the park was very pretty.  

15
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:02,800
There were a lot of flowers - blue, yellow 
and red. Tom felt happy when he saw them.

16
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:11,040
The fair was good, too. There were a lot 
of people there, and many different games.  

17
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:19,040
Tom played some games. He won a box 
of fruit and a book about sport.  

18
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,640
Then he bought an ice-cream 
because he was hot and thirsty.

19
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:32,800
'I'm having a good day!' he thought. 
He sat down and ate his ice-cream.  

20
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,520
'Now, what shall I do next?'

21
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,720
Suddenly he saw, in large letters:
 
 

22
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,960
MADAM ZELDA KNOWS THE FUTURE

23
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:56,240
Do you want to know about your future? 
Come in and talk to Madame Zelda.
 
 

24
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,480
Tom Smith thought very hard.

25
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:08,320
'Shall I go in?' he thought. 'Why 
not? I'm not afraid of the future.

26
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:17,840
Perhaps it will be interesting. Yes, I'll go 
in and have a conversation with Madame Zelda.'

27
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,640
So he went in. It was very dark inside.  

28
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,480
An old woman with grey hair 
and a kind face smiled at Tom.

29
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:37,760
'Hello, young man!' she said. 'Sit down 
and I will tell you about your future.'

30
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:46,080
Tom sat down. The old woman 
looked at some cards on the table.

31
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,800
'Take three cards,' she said.

32
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,040
Tom took the cards and gave them to her.  

33
00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:02,640
The woman looked at the cards for a long 
time. Then she spoke. She didn't smile now.

34
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:10,000
'Listen!' she said. 'I have to 
tell you something very important.

35
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:22,480
Do not go anywhere next Friday. Make a journey 
next Friday, and you will never arrive! Something  

36
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:32,000
will happen on the way. Don't forget now. I can 
tell you nothing more. Be careful, young man.'

37
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:42,480
Tom left. The sun was very hot on his face. He 
had no more money, and he wanted to go home.  

38
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:49,680
'I'm not afraid,' he thought. 'I don't 
go on journeys. I won't go anywhere  

39
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:57,520
next Friday. Every day is the same to me. I 
haven't got a job, so I don't go anywhere.'

40
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:08,720
But on Thursday Tom had a letter. It was an 
answer to one of his letters! There was a job in  

41
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:18,960
a town thirty kilometers away. It was in a sports 
shop. The boss wanted to meet Tom the next day.

42
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:25,760
Tom felt very happy. 'I'll 
have to take a train there,'  

43
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:29,040
he thought. 'I can't walk thirty kilometers.'

44
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:34,240
Suddenly he remembered the old woman at the fair,  

45
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:42,560
and he felt afraid. 'Do not go 
anywhere next Friday,' she told him.

46
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:53,520
'But what can I do?' Tom thought sadly. 'I can't 
lose this job. It's too important to me. I'll  

47
00:05:53,520 --> 00:06:00,240
have to take the train tomorrow. And what can 
an old woman know about the future? Nothing!'

48
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:06,480
But he wasn't very happy about it. 
And he didn't sleep well that night.

49
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:15,920
The next day was Friday, and Tom went 
to the station. He bought a ticket  

50
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:20,720
at the ticket office. The train 
arrived, and he climbed on it.

51
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:29,200
An old man sat down next to Tom. His face 
was intelligent under his white hair.  

52
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:33,840
He had a bad leg, and Tom felt sorry for him.

53
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,360
The train left the station 
and went through the country.  

54
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:48,160
A waiter came round with some food and 
the old man bought a sandwich. Then  

55
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:56,080
he smiled at Tom and said, 'Are you thirsty? 
I've got some tea with me. Would you like some?'

56
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:05,600
He took out a cup and gave Tom some tea. 'He's 
a kind man!' Tom thought. 'I really like him.'

57
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:16,240
He smiled at the old man and said, 'Thank 
you. I'm Tom Smith. Are you going a long way?'

58
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:23,680
But the old man couldn't answer. Suddenly 
there was a very loud noise and the train  

59
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:30,640
stopped. What was wrong? The people 
on the train were afraid. They all  

60
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:34,080
looked out of the windows, but 
they couldn't see anything.

61
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,720
'Don't be afraid,' Tom told his new friend.  

62
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:45,520
'I'll go and see. Perhaps it's an 
accident. Stay here and you'll be OK.'

63
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:54,080
The old man smiled. 'Thank you, my young 
friend,' he said. 'I will stay here.  

64
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,280
My old legs are very weak.'

65
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:05,120
Tom found the guard. 'What's wrong?' 
he asked him. 'Why did we stop?'

66
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,880
The guard looked at Tom unhappily.  

67
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:17,360
'There's a large tree in front of the train,' he 
said. 'We'll have to move it, but we can't do it  

68
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:26,240
quickly. So this is the end of the journey for 
you. You'll have to get off the train and walk.'

69
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,080
'Walk where?' Tom asked.

70
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,200
The guard looked at a map. 
'There's a village near here.  

71
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:41,280
You can go there and perhaps find a restaurant 
or a cafe. I have to stay here with the train.  

72
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,400
I'm very sorry about your journey. 
But you'll get your money back.'

73
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:56,640
Tom thought, 'The money isn't important. I 
really wanted that job!' And he felt very sad.

74
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:02,320
Tom didn't say anything 
about the job to the old man.  

75
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:07,840
He helped his friend off the train 
and carried his case to the village.

76
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:12,400
'Thank you very much,' the old man said to Tom.  

77
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:19,760
'I know that my case is heavy. There's a 
computer in it, and there are a lot of papers.'

78
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:30,080
Tom smiled. 'It's all right,' he said. But 
inside he was very sad. 'I was stupid,' he  

79
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:36,800
thought. 'I didn't listen to the old woman, 
but she was right. I won't get that job now.'

80
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:45,280
The old man saw Tom's sad face and asked 
him, 'What's wrong, my young friend?'

81
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,560
So Tom told him the story about 
the job in the sports shop.

82
00:09:51,600 --> 00:10:02,000
Then a strange thing happened. The old man 
smiled, and then he laughed! Why did he laugh?  

83
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,160
Tom didn't know and he felt a little angry.  

84
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:13,760
The old man was his friend, but this 
was a bad day for Tom. It wasn't funny!

85
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:21,680
Tom couldn't speak or smile. The old 
man saw this and he stopped laughing.  

86
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:33,760
Then he said, 'Listen to me, Tom, and don't be 
sad. I'm a rich man. I've got a lot of shops in  

87
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:42,240
different towns, and they're all sports 
shops. I want an intelligent young man  

88
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:53,440
to work in my new shop, It's also my biggest shop! 
Will yon work for me? I think I know you now. You  

89
00:10:53,440 --> 00:11:00,560
were very kind to me on the train. You're the 
right person for the job. What's your answer?'

90
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,720
'This is wonderful,'  

91
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:13,840
Tom said with a happy smile. 'This is the 
best day of my life, not the worst!'
 
 
 
 

92
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,419
- THE END -
