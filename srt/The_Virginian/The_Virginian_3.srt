1
00:00:00,018 --> 00:00:00,240
With that he also took himself away.

2
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,244
The ladies were inclined to be
scandalized, but not the Judge.

3
00:00:02,244 --> 00:00:03,513
When my whole story was done,
he brought his fist down on the table,

4
00:00:03,513 --> 00:00:05,250
and not lightly this time.

5
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:06,056
“I’d make him lieutenant general if the
ranch offered that position!”

6
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
he declared.

7
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
Miss Molly Wood said nothing at the time.

8
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
But in the afternoon,
by her wish, she went fishing,

9
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
with the Virginian deputed to escort
her.

10
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
I rode with them, for a while.

11
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
I was not going to continue a third in
that party; the Virginian was too

12
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
becomingly dressed, and I saw Kenilworth
peeping out of his pocket.

13
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
I meant to be fishing by myself when
that volume was returned.

14
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
But Miss Wood talked with skilful
openness as we rode.

15
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
“I’ve heard all about you and
Dr. MacBride,” she said.

16
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
“How could you do it,
when the Judge places

17
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
such confidence in you?”

18
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
He looked pleased.

19
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
“I reckon,” he said, “I couldn’t be so
good if I wasn’t bad onced in a while.”

20
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
“Why, there’s a skunk,”
said I, noticing the pretty little

21
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
animal trotting in front of us at the
edge of the thickets.

22
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
“Oh, where is it?

23
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
Don’t let me see it!”

24
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
screamed Molly.

25
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
And at this deeply feminine remark,
the Virginian looked at her with such a

26
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
smile that, had I been a woman,
it would have made me his to do what he

27
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
pleased with on the spot.

28
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
Upon the lady, however,
it seemed to make less impression.

29
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
Or rather, I had better say,
whatever were her feelings,

30
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
she very naturally made no display of
them, and contrived not to be aware of

31
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
that expression which had passed
over the Virginian’s face.

32
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
It was later that these few words reached
me while I was fishing alone:⁠—

33
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
“Have you anything different
to tell me yet?”

34
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
I heard him say.

35
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
“Yes; I have.”

36
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
She spoke in accents light
and well intrenched.

37
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
“I wish to say that I have never liked
any man better than you.

38
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
But I expect to!”

39
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
He must have drawn small comfort from
such an answer as that.

40
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
But he laughed out indomitably:⁠—

41
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
“Don’t yu’ go betting
on any such expectation!”

42
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
And then their words ceased to be
distinct, and it was only their two

43
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
voices that I heard wandering among the
windings of the stream.

44
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
CHAPTER XXII

45
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
“What Is a Rustler?”

46
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
We all know what birds of a feather do.

47
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
And it may be safely surmised that if a
bird of any particular feather has been

48
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
for a long while unable to see other
birds of its kind, it will flock with

49
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
them all the more assiduously when they
happen to alight in its vicinity.

50
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
Now the Ogdens were birds
of Molly’s feather.

51
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
They wore Eastern, and not Western,
plumage, and their song was a different

52
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
song from that which the
Bear Creek birds sang.

53
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
To be sure, the piping of little George
Taylor was full of hopeful interest;

54
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
and many other strains,
both striking and melodious,

55
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
were lifted in Cattle Land,
and had given pleasure to Molly’s ear.

56
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
But although Indians,
and bears, and mavericks,

57
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
make worthy themes for song,
these are not the only

58
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
songs in the world.

59
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
Therefore the Eastern warblings of the
Ogdens sounded doubly

60
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
sweet to Molly Wood.

61
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
Such words as Newport,
Bar Harbor, and Tiffany’s

62
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
thrilled her exceedingly.

63
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
It made no difference that she herself
had never been to Newport or Bar Harbor,

64
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
and had visited Tiffany’s more often to
admire than to purchase.

65
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
On the contrary, this rather added a
dazzle to the music of the Ogdens.

66
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
And Molly, whose Eastern song had been
silent in this strange land,

67
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
began to chirp it again during the visit
that she made at the Sunk Creek Ranch.

68
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
Thus the Virginian’s cause by no means
prospered at this time.

69
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
His forces were scattered,
while Molly’s were concentrated.

70
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
The girl was not at that point where
absence makes the heart grow fonder.

71
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
While the Virginian was trundling his
long, responsible miles in the caboose,

72
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
delivering the cattle at Chicago,
vanquishing Trampas along the

73
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
Yellowstone, she had regained herself.

74
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
Thus it was that she could tell him so
easily during those first hours that

75
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
they were alone after his return,
“I expect to like another

76
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
man better than you.”

77
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
Absence had recruited her.

78
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
And then the Ogdens had reinforced her.

79
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
They brought the East back powerfully to
her memory, and her thoughts

80
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
filled with it.

81
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
They did not dream that they were
assisting in any battle.

82
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
No one ever had more unconscious allies
than did Molly at that time.

83
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
But she used them consciously,
or almost consciously.

84
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
She frequented them; she spoke of Eastern
matters; she found that she had

85
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
acquaintances whom the Ogdens also knew,
and she often brought

86
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
them into the conversation.

87
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
For it may be said, I think,
that she was fighting a

88
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
battle⁠—nay, a campaign.

89
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
And perhaps this was a hopeful sign for
the Virginian (had he but known it),

90
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
that the girl resorted to allies.

91
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
She surrounded herself,
she steeped herself,

92
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
with the East, to have,
as it were, a sort of counteractant

93
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
against the spell of the
black-haired horse man.

94
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
And his forces were, as
I have said, scattered.

95
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
For his promotion gave him no
more time for lovemaking.

96
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
He was foreman now.

97
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
He had said to Judge Henry,
“I’ll try to please yu’.”

98
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
And after the throb of emotion which
these words had both concealed and

99
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
conveyed, there came to him that sort of
intention to win which

100
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
amounts to a certainty.

101
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
Yes, he would please Judge Henry!

102
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
He did not know how much he
had already pleased him.

103
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
He did not know that the Judge was
humorously undecided which of his new

104
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
foreman’s first acts had the more
delighted him: his performance with the

105
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
missionary, or his magnanimity
to Trampas.

106
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
“Good feeling is a great thing in
anyone,” the Judge would say;

107
00:00:06,056 --> -1:59:59,000
“but I like to know that my foreman
has so much sense.

108
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

109
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
“I am personally very grateful to
him,” said Mrs. Henry.

110
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
And indeed so was the whole company.

111
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
To be afflicted with Dr. MacBride for one
night instead of six

112
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
was a great liberation.

113
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
But the Virginian never saw his
sweetheart alone again;

114
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
while she was at the Sunk Creek Ranch,
his duties called him away so much that

115
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
there was no chance for him.

116
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
Worse still, that habit of birds of a
feather brought about

117
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
a separation more considerable.

118
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
She arranged to go East with the Ogdens.

119
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
It was so good an opportunity to travel
with friends, instead of

120
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
making the journey alone!

121
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
Molly’s term of ministration at the
schoolhouse had so pleased Bear Creek

122
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
that she was warmly urged
to take a holiday.

123
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
School could afford to
begin a little late.

124
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
Accordingly, she departed.

125
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
The Virginian hid his sore heart from her
during the moment of

126
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
farewell that they had.

127
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
“No, I’ll not want any more books,”
he said, “till yu’ come back.”

128
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
And then he made cheerfulness.

129
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
“It’s just the other way round!”

130
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
said he.

131
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
“What is the other way round?”

132
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
“Why, last time it was me that went
travelling, and you that stayed behind.”

133
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
“So it was!”

134
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
And here she gave him a last scratch.

135
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
“But you’ll be busier than ever,”
she said; “no spare time

136
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
to grieve about me!”

137
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
She could wound him, and she knew it.

138
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
Nobody else could.

139
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
That is why she did it.

140
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
But he gave her something
to remember, too.

141
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
“Next time,” he said,
“neither of us will stay behind.

142
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
We’ll both go together.”

143
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
And with these words he gave
her no laughing glance.

144
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
It was a look that mingled with the
words; so that now and again in the

145
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
train, both came back to her,
and she sat pensive,

146
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
drawing near to Bennington and hearing
his voice and seeing his eyes.

147
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
How is it that this girl could cry at
having to tell Sam Bannett she could not

148
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
think of him, and then treat another
lover as she treated the Virginian?

149
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
I cannot tell you, having never (as I
said before) been a woman myself.

150
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
Bennington opened its arms
to its venturesome daughter.

151
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
Much was made of Molly Wood.

152
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
Old faces and old places welcomed her.

153
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
Fatted calves of varying
dimensions made their appearance.

154
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
And although the fatted calf is an animal
that can assume more divergent shapes

155
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
than any other known creature⁠—being
sometimes champagne and partridges,

156
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
and again cake and currant wine⁠—through
each disguise you can always

157
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
identify the same calf.

158
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
The girl from Bear Creek met
it at every turn.

159
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
The Bannetts at Hoosic Falls offered a
large specimen to Molly⁠—a dinner

160
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
(perhaps I should say a
banquet) of twenty-four.

161
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
And Sam Bannett of course took her to
drive more than once.

162
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
“I want to see the Hoosic
Bridge,” she would say.

163
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
And when they reached that well-
remembered point, “How lovely it is!”

164
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
she exclaimed.

165
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
And as she gazed at the view up and down
the valley, she would grow pensive.

166
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
“How natural the church
looks,” she continued.

167
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
And then, having crossed both bridges,
“Oh, there’s the dear old lodge gate!”

168
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:06,056
Or again, while they drove up the valley
of the little Hoosic:

169
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:07,278
“I had forgotten it was
so nice and lonely.

170
00:00:07,278 --> 00:00:08,718
But after all, no woods are so
interesting as those where you might

171
00:00:08,718 --> 00:00:09,645
possibly see a bear or an elk.”

172
00:00:09,645 --> 00:00:10,518
And upon another occasion,
after a cry of enthusiasm at the view

173
00:00:10,518 --> 00:00:11,158
from the top of Mount Anthony,
“It’s lovely, lovely,

174
00:00:11,158 --> 00:00:12,278
lovely,” she said, with diminishing
cadence, ending in pensiveness once

175
00:00:12,278 --> 00:00:12,915
more.

176
00:00:12,915 --> 00:00:14,094
“Do you see that little bit just there?

177
00:00:14,094 --> 00:00:14,968
No, not where the trees are⁠—that bare
spot that looks brown and

178
00:00:14,968 --> 00:00:15,408
warm in the sun.

179
00:00:15,408 --> 00:00:16,599
With a little sagebrush,
that spot would look something like a

180
00:00:16,599 --> 00:00:17,777
place I know on Bear Creek.

181
00:00:17,777 --> 00:00:18,894
Only of course you don’t get
the clear air here.”

182
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:18,894
“I don’t forget you,” said Sam.

183
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:18,894
“Do you remember me?

184
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:18,894
Or is it out of sight out of mind?”

185
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:18,894
And with this beginning
he renewed his suit.

186
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:18,894
She told him that she forgot no one;
that she should return always,

187
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:18,894
lest they might forget her.

188
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:18,894
“Return always!”

189
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:18,894
he exclaimed.

190
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:18,894
“You talk as if your anchor was dragging.”

191
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:18,894
Was it?

192
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:18,894
At all events, Sam failed in his suit.

193
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:18,894
Over in the house at Dunbarton,
the old lady held Molly’s hand and

194
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:18,894
looked a long while at her.

195
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:18,894
“You have changed very
much,” she said finally.

196
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:18,894
“I am a year older,” said the girl.

197
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:18,894
“Pshaw, my dear!”

198
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:18,894
said the great-aunt.

199
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:18,894
“Who is he?”

200
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:18,894
“Nobody!”

201
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:18,894
cried Molly, with indignation.

202
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:18,894
“Then you shouldn’t answer so loud,”
said the great-aunt.

203
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:18,894
The girl suddenly hid her face.

204
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:18,894
“I don’t believe I can love anyone,”
she said, “except myself.”

205
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:18,894
And then that old lady,
who in her day had made her courtesy to

206
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:18,894
Lafayette, began to stroke her niece’s
buried head, because she

207
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:18,894
more than half understood.

208
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:18,894
And understanding thus much,
she asked no prying questions,

209
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:18,894
but thought of the days of her own
youth, and only spoke a little quiet

210
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:18,894
love and confidence to Molly.

211
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:18,894
“I am an old, old woman,” she said.

212
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:18,894
“But I haven’t forgotten about it.

213
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:18,894
They objected to him because
he had no fortune.

214
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:18,894
But he was brave and handsome,
and I loved him, my dear.

215
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:18,894
Only I ought to have loved him more.

216
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:18,894
I gave him my promise to think about it.

217
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:18,894
And he and his ship were lost.”

218
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:18,894
The great-aunt’s voice had become very
soft and low, and she

219
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:18,894
spoke with many pauses.

220
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:18,894
“So then I knew.

221
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:18,894
If I had⁠—if⁠—perhaps I should have lost
him; but it would have

222
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:18,894
been after⁠—ah, well!

223
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:18,894
So long as you can help it, never marry!

224
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:18,894
But when you cannot help it a moment
longer, then listen to nothing but that;

225
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:18,894
for, my dear, I know your choice would
be worthy of the Starks.

226
00:00:18,894 --> -1:59:59,000
And now⁠—let me see his picture.

227
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

228
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:18,894
“Why, aunty!”

229
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:18,982
said Molly.

230
00:00:18,982 --> 00:00:20,334
“Well, I won’t pretend to be
supernatural,” said the aunt,

231
00:00:20,334 --> 00:00:21,387
“but I thought you kept one back when
you were showing us those

232
00:00:21,387 --> 00:00:21,427
Western views last night.”

233
00:00:21,427 --> 00:00:21,556
Now this was the precise truth.

234
00:00:21,556 --> 00:00:22,267
Molly had brought a number of photographs
from Wyoming to show to

235
00:00:22,267 --> 00:00:22,267
her friends at home.

236
00:00:22,267 --> 00:00:23,667
These, however, with one
exception, were not portraits.

237
00:00:23,667 --> 00:00:25,667
They were views of scenery and of cattle
roundups, and other scenes

238
00:00:25,667 --> 00:00:27,369
characteristic of ranch life.

239
00:00:27,369 --> 00:00:28,769
Of young men she had in her possession
several photographs,

240
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:29,660
and all but one of these she
had left behind her.

241
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:30,561
Her aunt’s penetration had in a way
mesmerized the girl;

242
00:00:30,561 --> 00:00:32,481
she rose obediently and sought that
picture of the Virginian.

243
00:00:32,481 --> 00:00:34,201
It was full length, displaying him in all
his cowboy trappings⁠—the leathern

244
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:36,701
chaps, the belt and pistol,
and in his hand a coil of rope.

245
00:00:36,701 --> 00:00:37,581
Not one of her family had seen it,
or suspected its existence.

246
00:00:37,581 --> 00:00:38,901
She now brought it downstairs and placed
it in her aunt’s hand.

247
00:00:38,901 --> 00:00:38,901
“Mercy!”

248
00:00:38,901 --> 00:00:39,286
cried the old lady.

249
00:00:39,286 --> 00:00:41,172
Molly was silent, but
her eye grew warlike.

250
00:00:41,172 --> 00:00:44,205
“Is that the way⁠—” began the aunt.

251
00:00:44,205 --> 00:00:44,285
“Mercy!”

252
00:00:44,285 --> 00:00:45,903
she murmured; and she sat
staring at the picture.

253
00:00:45,903 --> 00:00:47,130
Molly remained silent.

254
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:48,748
Her aunt looked slowly up at her.

255
00:00:48,748 --> 00:00:50,722
“Has a man like that presumed⁠—”

256
00:00:50,722 --> 00:00:52,095
“He’s not a bit like that.

257
00:00:52,095 --> 00:00:55,743
Yes, he’s exactly like that,” said Molly.

258
00:00:55,743 --> 00:00:58,296
And she would have snatched the
photograph away, but

259
00:00:58,296 --> 00:00:59,794
her aunt retained it.

260
00:00:59,794 --> 00:01:04,219
“Well,” she said, “I suppose there are
days when he does not kill people.”

261
00:01:04,219 --> 00:01:05,638
“He never killed anybody!”

262
00:01:05,638 --> 00:01:06,778
And Molly laughed.

263
00:01:06,778 --> 00:01:10,422
“Are you seriously⁠—” said the old lady.

264
00:01:10,422 --> -1:59:59,000
“I almost might⁠—at times

265
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
.

266
00:01:12,978 --> 00:01:14,444
He is perfectly splendid.”

267
00:01:14,444 --> 00:01:18,395
“My dear, you have fallen in
love with his clothes.”

268
00:01:18,395 --> 00:01:21,706
“It’s not his clothes.

269
00:01:21,706 --> 00:01:23,184
And I’m not in love.

270
00:01:23,184 --> 00:01:24,697
He often wears others.

271
00:01:24,697 --> 00:01:26,774
He wears a white collar like anybody.”

272
00:01:26,774 --> 00:01:29,784
“Then that would be a more suitable way
to be photographed, I think.

273
00:01:29,784 --> 00:01:31,829
He couldn’t go round like that here.

274
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:33,792
I could not receive him myself.”

275
00:01:33,792 --> 00:01:35,595
“He’d never think of such a thing.

276
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:39,142
Why, you talk as if he were a savage.”

277
00:01:39,142 --> 00:01:42,342
The old lady studied the picture
closely for a minute.

278
00:01:42,342 --> 00:01:46,157
“I think it is a good
face,” she finally remarked.

279
00:01:46,157 --> 00:01:48,445
“Is the fellow as handsome
as that, my dear?”

280
00:01:48,445 --> 00:01:50,673
More so, Molly thought.

281
00:01:50,673 --> 00:01:53,938
And who was he, and what
were his prospects?

282
00:01:53,938 --> 00:01:56,353
were the aunt’s next inquiries.

283
00:01:56,353 --> 00:02:00,320
She shook her head at the answers which
she received; and she also shook her

284
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:05,405
head over her niece’s emphatic denial
that her heart was lost to this man.

285
00:02:05,405 --> 00:02:09,034
But when their parting came,
the old lady said:⁠—

286
00:02:09,034 --> 00:02:11,514
“God bless you and keep you, my dear.

287
00:02:11,514 --> 00:02:13,140
I’ll not try to manage you.

288
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:17,111
They managed me⁠—” A sigh spoke the
rest of this sentence.

289
00:02:17,111 --> 00:02:21,265
“But I’m not worried about you⁠—at
least, not very much.

290
00:02:21,265 --> 00:02:24,876
You have never done anything that was not
worthy of the Starks.

291
00:02:24,876 --> 00:02:28,876
And if you’re going to take him,
do it before I die so that I can bid him

292
00:02:28,876 --> 00:02:30,212
welcome for your sake.

293
00:02:30,212 --> -1:59:59,000
God bless you, my dear.

294
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

295
00:02:32,476 --> 00:02:36,408
And after the girl had gone back to
Bennington, the great-aunt had this

296
00:02:36,408 --> 00:02:38,302
thought: “She is like us all.

297
00:02:38,302 --> 00:02:40,109
She wants a man that is a man.”

298
00:02:40,109 --> 00:02:44,946
Nor did the old lady breathe her
knowledge to any member of the family.

299
00:02:44,946 --> 00:02:47,511
For she was a loyal spirit,
and her girl’s confidence

300
00:02:47,511 --> 00:02:48,676
was sacred to her.

301
00:02:48,676 --> 00:02:53,966
“Besides,” she reflected,
“if even I can do nothing with her,

302
00:02:53,966 --> 00:02:55,829
what a mess they’d make of it!

303
00:02:55,829 --> 00:02:58,651
We should hear of her elopement next.”

304
00:02:58,651 --> 00:03:04,798
So Molly’s immediate family never saw
that photograph, and never heard a word

305
00:03:04,798 --> 00:03:06,900
from her upon this subject.

306
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:11,412
But on the day that she left for Bear
Creek, as they sat missing her and

307
00:03:11,412 --> 00:03:14,658
discussing her visit in the evening,
Mrs. Bell observed: “Mother,

308
00:03:14,658 --> 00:03:17,569
how did you think she was?”⁠—“I never
saw her better, Sarah.

309
00:03:17,569 --> 00:03:23,195
That horrible place seems to agree with
her.”⁠—“Oh, yes, agree.

310
00:03:23,195 --> 00:03:28,253
It seemed to me⁠—”⁠—“Well?”⁠—“Oh,
just somehow that she was thinking.”

311
00:03:28,253 --> 00:03:30,987
⁠—“Thinking?”⁠—“Well,
I believe she has something on her

312
00:03:30,987 --> 00:03:34,158
mind.”⁠—“You mean a man,”
said Andrew Bell.⁠—“A man,

313
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:38,198
Andrew?”⁠—“Yes, Mrs. Wood,
that’s what Sarah always means.”

314
00:03:38,198 --> 00:03:42,023
It may be mentioned that Sarah’s surmises
did not greatly contribute

315
00:03:42,023 --> 00:03:43,892
to her mother’s happiness.

316
00:03:43,892 --> 00:03:48,811
And rumor is so strange a thing that
presently from the malicious outside air

317
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:52,776
came a vague and dreadful word⁠—one of
those words that cannot be

318
00:03:52,776 --> 00:03:54,251
traced to its source.

319
00:03:54,251 --> 00:03:58,091
Somebody said to Andrew Bell that they
heard Miss Molly Wood was engaged

320
00:03:58,091 --> 00:03:59,248
to marry a rustler.

321
00:03:59,248 --> 00:04:00,731
“Heavens, Andrew!”

322
00:04:00,731 --> 00:04:02,983
said his wife; “what is a rustler?”

323
00:04:02,983 --> 00:04:06,653
It was not in any dictionary,
and current translations

324
00:04:06,653 --> 00:04:08,515
of it were inconsistent.

325
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:11,853
A man at Hoosic Falls said that he had
passed through Cheyenne,

326
00:04:11,853 --> 00:04:14,973
and heard the term applied in a
complimentary way to people who

327
00:04:14,973 --> 00:04:16,333
were alive and pushing.

328
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:19,973
Another man had always supposed it meant
some kind of horse.

329
00:04:19,973 --> 00:04:24,431
But the most alarming version of all was
that a rustler was a cattle thief.

330
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:27,731
Now the truth is that all
these meanings were right.

331
00:04:27,731 --> 00:04:31,744
The word ran a sort of progress in the
cattle country, gathering many

332
00:04:31,744 --> 00:04:33,042
meanings as it went.

333
00:04:33,042 --> 00:04:37,064
It gathered more, however, in Bennington.

334
00:04:37,064 --> 00:04:43,352
In a very few days, gossip had it that
Molly was engaged to a gambler,

335
00:04:43,352 --> 00:04:50,732
a gold miner, an escaped stage robber,
and a Mexican bandit;

336
00:04:50,732 --> 00:04:53,976
while Mrs. Flynt feared she
had married a Mormon.

337
00:04:53,976 --> 00:04:58,674
Along Bear Creek, however,
Molly and her “rustler” took a ride

338
00:04:58,674 --> 00:05:00,453
soon after her return.

339
00:05:00,453 --> 00:05:05,397
They were neither married nor engaged,
and she was telling him about Vermont.

340
00:05:05,397 --> 00:05:07,921
“I never was there,” said he.

341
00:05:07,921 --> 00:05:10,539
“Never happened to strike
in that direction.”

342
00:05:10,539 --> 00:05:12,377
“What decided your direction?”

343
00:05:12,377 --> 00:05:14,839
“Oh, looking for chances.

344
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:19,782
I reckon I must have been more ambitious
than my brothers⁠—or more restless.

345
00:05:19,782 --> 00:05:21,476
They stayed around on farms.

346
00:05:21,476 --> 00:05:22,939
But I got out.

347
00:05:22,939 --> 00:05:26,701
When I went back again six years
afterward, I was twenty.

348
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:29,633
They was talking about
the same old things.

349
00:05:29,633 --> 00:05:34,603
Men of twenty-five and thirty⁠—yet just
sittin’ and talkin’ about

350
00:05:34,603 --> 00:05:36,156
the same old things.

351
00:05:36,156 --> 00:05:40,899
I told my mother about what I’d seen here
and there, and she liked it,

352
00:05:40,899 --> 00:05:42,198
right to her death.

353
00:05:42,198 --> 00:05:46,388
But the others⁠—well,
when I found this whole world was hawgs

354
00:05:46,388 --> 00:05:50,308
and turkeys to them,
with a little gunnin’ afteh small game

355
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:56,390
throwed in, I put on my hat one mawnin’
and told ’em maybe when I was fifty I’d

356
00:05:56,390 --> 00:06:00,407
look in on ’em again to see if they’d
got any new subjects.

357
00:06:00,407 --> 00:06:01,629
But they’ll never.

358
00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:04,908
My brothers don’t seem to want chances.”

359
00:06:04,908 --> 00:06:07,875
“You have lost a good
many yourself,” said Molly.

360
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:09,076
“That’s correct.”

361
00:06:09,076 --> 00:06:13,103
“And yet,” said she, “sometimes I think
you know a great deal more

362
00:06:13,103 --> 00:06:15,030
than I ever shall.”

363
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:19,391
“Why, of course I do,”
said he, quite simply.

364
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:22,802
“I have earned my living
since I was fourteen.

365
00:06:22,802 --> 00:06:26,316
And that’s from old Mexico
to British Columbia.

366
00:06:26,316 --> 00:06:29,020
I have never stolen or begged a cent.

367
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:31,125
I’d not want yu’ to know what I know.”

368
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:34,108
She was looking at him,
half listening and half thinking

369
00:06:34,108 --> 00:06:35,148
of her great-aunt.

370
00:06:35,148 --> 00:06:38,548
“I am not losing chances
any more,” he continued.

371
00:06:38,548 --> 00:06:40,712
“And you are the best I’ve got.”

372
00:06:40,712 --> 00:06:44,428
She was not sorry to have Georgie Taylor
come galloping along at this

373
00:06:44,428 --> 00:06:45,863
moment and join them.

374
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:49,246
But the Virginian swore
profanely under his breath.

375
00:06:49,246 --> 00:06:52,708
And on this ride nothing more happened.

376
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:54,151
CHAPTER XXIII

377
00:06:54,151 --> 00:06:55,491
Various Points

378
00:06:55,491 --> 00:06:58,522
Love had been snowbound for many weeks.

379
00:06:58,522 --> 00:07:03,353
Before this imprisonment its course had
run neither smooth nor rough,

380
00:07:03,353 --> 00:07:07,584
so far as eye could see;
it had run either not at all,

381
00:07:07,584 --> 00:07:10,842
or, as an undercurrent,
deep out of sight.

382
00:07:10,842 --> 00:07:16,659
In their rides, in their talks,
love had been dumb, as to spoken words

383
00:07:16,659 --> 00:07:20,040
at least; for the Virginian had set
himself a heavy task of

384
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,733
silence and of patience.

385
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:27,213
Then, where winter barred his visits to
Bear Creek, and there was for the while

386
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:33,537
no ranch work or responsibility to fill
his thoughts and blood with action,

387
00:07:33,537 --> 00:07:36,178
he set himself a task much lighter.

388
00:07:36,178 --> 00:07:40,236
Often, instead of Shakespeare and
fiction, school books lay open on his

389
00:07:40,236 --> 00:07:43,999
cabin table; and penmanship and spelling
helped the hours to pass.

390
00:07:43,999 --> 00:07:49,329
Many sheets of paper did he fill with
various exercises, and Mrs. Henry gave

391
00:07:49,329 --> 00:07:53,680
him her assistance in
advice and corrections.

392
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,508
“I shall presently be in love with him
myself,” she told the Judge.

393
00:07:57,508 --> 00:07:59,994
“And it’s time for you to become anxious.”

394
00:07:59,994 --> 00:08:02,835
“I am perfectly safe,” he retorted.

395
00:08:02,835 --> 00:08:05,026
“There’s only one woman for him any more.”

396
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:08,268
“She is not good enough for
him,” declared Mrs. Henry.

397
00:08:08,268 --> 00:08:09,710
“But he’ll never see that.”

398
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:13,437
So the snow fell, the world froze,
and the spelling-books

399
00:08:13,437 --> 00:08:15,274
and exercises went on.

400
00:08:15,274 --> 00:08:19,850
But this was not the only case of
education which was progressing at the

401
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:23,345
Sunk Creek Ranch while
love was snowbound.

402
00:08:23,345 --> 00:08:28,143
One morning Scipio le Moyne entered the
Virginian’s sitting room⁠—that apartment

403
00:08:28,143 --> 00:08:32,104
where Dr. MacBride had wrestled with sin
so courageously all night.

404
00:08:32,104 --> 00:08:34,451
The Virginian sat at his desk.

405
00:08:34,451 --> 00:08:38,243
Open books lay around him;
a half-finished piece of writing was

406
00:08:38,243 --> 00:08:41,403
beneath his fist; his fingers
were coated with ink.

407
00:08:41,403 --> 00:08:45,606
Education enveloped him, it may be said.

408
00:08:45,606 --> 00:08:47,806
But there was none in his eye.

409
00:08:47,806 --> 00:08:52,725
That was upon the window,
looking far across the cold plain.

410
00:08:52,725 --> 00:08:56,296
The foreman did not move when Scipio came
in, and this humorous

411
00:08:56,296 --> 00:09:00,219
spirit smiled to himself.

412
00:09:00,219 --> 00:09:07,147
“It’s Bear Creek he’s havin’ a
vision of,” he concluded.

413
00:09:07,147 --> 00:09:11,492
But he knew instantly that
this was not so.

414
00:09:11,492 --> 00:09:16,030
The Virginian was looking at something
real, and Scipio went to the window

415
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:17,243
to see for himself.

416
00:09:17,243 --> 00:09:22,710
“Well,” he said, having seen,
“when is he going to leave us?”

417
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:26,885
The foreman continued looking at
two horsemen riding together.

418
00:09:26,885 --> 00:09:31,355
Their shapes, small in the distance,
showed black against

419
00:09:31,355 --> 00:09:32,976
the universal whiteness.

420
00:09:32,976 --> 00:09:35,959
“When d’ yu’ figure he’ll leave us?”

421
00:09:35,959 --> 00:09:37,439
repeated Scipio.

422
00:09:37,439 --> 00:09:41,572
“He,” murmured the Virginian,
always watching the distant

423
00:09:41,572 --> 00:09:43,372
horsemen; and again, “he.”

424
00:09:43,372 --> 00:09:46,917
Scipio sprawled down,
familiarly, across a chair.

425
00:09:46,917 --> 00:09:50,912
He and the Virginian had come to know
each other very well since that

426
00:09:50,912 --> 00:09:53,000
first meeting at Medora.

427
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,352
They were birds many of whose feathers
were the same, and the Virginian often

428
00:09:57,352 --> 00:09:59,823
talked to Scipio without reserve.

429
00:09:59,823 --> 00:10:06,655
Consequently, Scipio now understood those
two syllables that the Virginian had

430
00:10:06,655 --> 00:10:11,021
pronounced precisely as though the
sentences which lay between them

431
00:10:11,021 --> 00:10:12,961
had been fully expressed.

432
00:10:12,961 --> 00:10:14,921
“Hm,” he remarked.

433
00:10:14,921 --> 00:10:18,914
“Well, one will be a gain,
and the other won’t be no loss.”

434
00:10:18,914 --> -1:59:59,000
“Poor Shorty

435
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
!”

436
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:21,614
said the Virginian.

437
00:10:21,614 --> 00:10:22,964
“Poor fool!”

438
00:10:22,964 --> 00:10:25,402
Scipio was less compassionate.

439
00:10:25,402 --> 00:10:29,177
“No,” he persisted, “I
ain’t sorry for him.

440
00:10:29,177 --> -1:59:59,000
Any man old enough to have hair on his
face ought to see through Trampas.

441
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

442
00:10:34,696 --> 00:10:40,441
The Virginian looked out of the window
again, and watched Shorty and Trampas as

443
00:10:40,441 --> 00:10:42,132
they rode in the distance.

444
00:10:42,132 --> 00:10:46,485
“Shorty is kind to animals,” he said.

445
00:10:46,485 --> 00:10:51,109
“He has gentled that hawss Pedro he
bought with his first money.

446
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:53,414
Gentled him wonderful.

447
00:10:53,414 --> 00:10:57,261
When a man is kind to dumb animals,
I always say he had got

448
00:10:57,261 --> 00:10:58,562
some good in him.”

449
00:10:58,562 --> 00:11:01,453
“Yes,” Scipio reluctantly admitted.

450
00:11:01,453 --> 00:11:02,213
“Yes.

451
00:11:02,213 --> 00:11:04,292
But I always did hate a fool.”

452
00:11:04,292 --> 00:11:08,405
“This hyeh is a mighty cruel
country,” pursued the Virginian.

453
00:11:08,405 --> 00:11:11,169
“To animals that is.

454
00:11:11,169 --> 00:11:12,655
Think of it!

455
00:11:12,655 --> 00:11:16,157
Think what we do to hundreds an’
thousands of little calves!

456
00:11:16,157 --> 00:11:22,052
Throw ’em down, brand ’em,
cut ’em, ear mark ’em,

457
00:11:22,052 --> 00:11:24,394
turn ’em loose, and on to the next.

458
00:11:24,394 --> 00:11:26,968
It has got to be, of course.

459
00:11:26,968 --> 00:11:28,456
But I say this.

460
00:11:28,456 --> 00:11:34,900
If a man can go jammin’ hot irons on to
little calves and slicin’ pieces off ’em

461
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:39,592
with his knife, and live along,
keepin’ a kindness for animals in his

462
00:11:39,592 --> 00:11:41,378
heart, he has got some good in him.

463
00:11:41,378 --> 00:11:43,050
And that’s what Shorty has got.

464
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:47,637
But he is lettin’ Trampas get a hold of
him, and both of them will leave us.”

465
00:11:47,637 --> 00:11:51,423
And the Virginian looked out across the
huge winter whiteness again.

466
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:55,539
But the riders had now
vanished behind some foothills.

467
00:11:55,539 --> 00:11:58,359
Scipio sat silent.

468
00:11:58,359 --> 00:12:01,887
He had never put these thoughts about men
and animals to himself,

469
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:05,365
and when they were put to him,
he saw that they were true.

470
00:12:05,365 --> 00:12:08,322
“Queer,” he observed finally.

471
00:12:08,322 --> 00:12:08,708
“What?”

472
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:10,646
“Everything.”

473
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:15,487
“Nothing’s queer,” stated the Virginian,
“except marriage and lightning.

474
00:12:15,487 --> -1:59:59,000
Them two occurrences can still give me
a sensation of surprise.

475
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

476
00:12:20,421 --> 00:12:23,894
“All the same it is queer,”
Scipio insisted.

477
00:12:23,894 --> 00:12:26,113
“Well, let her go at me.”

478
00:12:26,113 --> 00:12:27,654
“Why, Trampas.

479
00:12:27,654 --> 00:12:28,960
He done you dirt.

480
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,511
You pass that over.

481
00:12:30,511 --> 00:12:34,387
You could have fired him,
but you let him stay and keep his job.

482
00:12:34,387 --> 00:12:36,296
That’s goodness.

483
00:12:36,296 --> 00:12:39,316
And badness is resultin’
from it, straight.

484
00:12:39,316 --> 00:12:41,978
Badness right from goodness.”

485
00:12:41,978 --> 00:12:45,858
“You’re off the trail a whole
lot,” said the Virginian.

486
00:12:45,858 --> 00:12:47,482
“Which side am I off, then?”

487
00:12:47,482 --> 00:12:51,245
“North, south, east, and west.

488
00:12:51,245 --> 00:12:52,565
First point.

489
00:12:52,565 --> 00:12:56,665
I didn’t expect to do Trampas any good by
not killin’ him, which I came pretty

490
00:12:56,665 --> 00:12:58,256
near doin’ three times.

491
00:12:58,256 --> 00:13:03,328
Nor I didn’t expect to do Trampas any
good by lettin’ him keep his job.

492
00:13:03,328 --> 00:13:06,038
But I am foreman of this ranch.

493
00:13:06,038 --> 00:13:12,136
And I can sit and tell all men to their
face: ‘I was above that meanness.’

494
00:13:12,136 --> 00:13:16,071
Point two: it ain’t any goodness,
it is Trampas that badness

495
00:13:16,071 --> 00:13:16,651
has resulted from.

496
00:13:16,651 --> 00:13:18,451
Put him anywhere and it will be the same.

497
00:13:18,451 --> 00:13:19,771
Put him under my eye,
and I can follow his

498
00:13:19,771 --> 00:13:20,411
moves a little, anyway.

499
00:13:20,411 --> 00:13:22,532
You have noticed, maybe,
that since you and I run on to that dead

500
00:13:22,532 --> 00:13:27,033
Polled Angus cow, that was still warm
when we got to her, we have found no

501
00:13:27,033 --> 00:13:28,633
more cows dead of sudden death.

502
00:13:28,633 --> 00:13:33,634
We came mighty close to catchin’ whoever
it was that killed that cow and ran her

503
00:13:33,634 --> 00:13:35,951
calf off to his own bunch.

504
00:13:35,951 --> 00:13:38,014
He wasn’t ten minutes ahead of us.

505
00:13:38,014 --> 00:13:42,585
We can prove nothin’; and he knows that
just as well as we do.

506
00:13:42,585 --> 00:13:47,158
But our cows have all quit
dyin’ of sudden death.

507
00:13:47,158 --> 00:13:50,490
And Trampas he’s gettin’ ready for
a change of residence.

508
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:54,038
As soon as all the outfits begin hirin’
new hands in the spring,

509
00:13:54,038 --> 00:13:56,814
Trampas will leave us and take a job
with some of them.

510
00:13:56,814 --> 00:13:59,979
And maybe our cows’ll commence gettin’
killed again, and we’ll have to take

511
00:13:59,979 --> 00:14:02,580
steps that will be more emphatic⁠—
maybe.”

512
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,885
Scipio meditated.

513
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:07,023
“I wonder what killin’ a man feels like?”

514
00:14:07,023 --> 00:14:08,012
he said.

515
00:14:08,012 --> 00:14:12,744
“Why, nothing to bother yu’⁠—when he’d
ought to have been killed.

516
00:14:12,744 --> 00:14:16,898
Next point: Trampas he’ll take Shorty
with him, which is certainly

517
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:18,090
bad for Shorty.

518
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:21,760
But it’s me that has kept Shorty out of
harm’s way this long.

519
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,149
If I had fired Trampas,
he’d have worked Shorty into

520
00:14:25,149 --> 00:14:27,259
dissatisfaction that much sooner.”

521
00:14:27,259 --> 00:14:28,956
Scipio meditated again.

522
00:14:28,956 --> 00:14:32,727
“I knowed Trampas would pull
his freight,” he said.

523
00:14:32,727 --> 00:14:34,429
“But I didn’t think of Shorty.

524
00:14:34,429 --> 00:14:35,819
What makes you think it?”

525
00:14:35,819 --> 00:14:38,107
“He asked me for a raise.”

526
00:14:38,107 --> 00:14:41,064
“He ain’t worth the pay he’s getting now.”

527
00:14:41,064 --> 00:14:43,261
“Trampas has told him different.”

528
00:14:43,261 --> 00:14:47,532
“When a man ain’t got no ideas of his
own,” said Scipio, “he’d ought to be

529
00:14:47,532 --> 00:14:50,252
kind o’ careful who he borrows ’em
from.”

530
00:14:50,252 --> 00:14:51,052
“That’s mighty correct,”
said the Virginian.

531
00:14:51,052 --> 00:14:51,892
“Poor Shorty!

532
00:14:51,892 --> 00:14:52,372
He has told me about his life.

533
00:14:52,372 --> 00:14:52,749
It is sorrowful.

534
00:14:52,749 --> 00:14:54,499
And he will never get wise.

535
00:14:54,499 --> 00:14:59,035
It was too late for him to get wise
when he was born.

536
00:14:59,035 --> 00:15:01,798
D’ yu’ know why he’s after higher wages?

537
00:15:01,798 --> -1:59:59,000
He sends most all his money East.

538
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

539
00:15:04,077 --> 00:15:07,435
“I don’t see what Trampas wants
him for,” said Scipio.

540
00:15:07,435 --> 00:15:10,137
“Oh, a handy tool some day.”

541
00:15:10,137 --> 00:15:12,229
“Not very handy,” said Scipio.

542
00:15:12,229 --> 00:15:15,727
“Well, Trampas is aimin’ to train him.

543
00:15:15,727 --> 00:15:20,049
Yu’ see, supposin’ yu’ were figuring to
turn professional thief⁠—yu’d be lookin’

544
00:15:20,049 --> 00:15:23,769
around for a nice young trustful
accomplice to take all the punishment

545
00:15:23,769 --> -1:59:59,000
and let you take the rest.

546
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

547
00:15:26,089 --> 00:15:27,495
“No such thing!”

548
00:15:27,495 --> 00:15:30,385
cried Scipio, angrily.

549
00:15:30,385 --> 00:15:31,582
“I’m no shirker.”

550
00:15:31,582 --> 00:15:35,382
And then, perceiving the Virginian’s
expression, he broke out laughing.

551
00:15:35,382 --> 00:15:40,769
“Well,” he exclaimed,
“yu’ fooled me that time.”

552
00:15:40,769 --> 00:15:41,945
“Looks that way.

553
00:15:41,945 --> 00:15:45,090
But I do mean it about Trampas.”

554
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:50,421
Presently Scipio rose,
and noticed the half-finished exercise

555
00:15:50,421 --> 00:15:52,998
upon the Virginian’s desk.

556
00:15:52,998 --> 00:15:56,092
“Trampas is a rolling stone,” he said.

557
00:15:56,092 --> 00:15:59,132
“A rolling piece of mud,”
corrected the Virginian.

558
00:15:59,132 --> 00:15:59,917
“Mud!

559
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:01,492
That’s right.

560
00:16:01,492 --> 00:16:03,559
I’m a rolling stone.

561
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:05,582
Sometimes I’d most like to quit being.”

562
00:16:05,582 --> 00:16:07,666
“That’s easy done,” said the Virginian.

563
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:11,265
“No doubt, when yu’ve found the moss
yu’ want to gather.”

564
00:16:11,265 --> 00:16:15,292
As Scipio glanced at the school books
again, a sparkle lurked in

565
00:16:15,292 --> 00:16:16,666
his bleached blue eye.

566
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:18,849
“I can cipher some,” he said.

567
00:16:18,849 --> 00:16:21,737
“But I expect I’ve got my
own notions about spelling.”

568
00:16:21,737 --> 00:16:26,265
“I retain a few private ideas that way
myself,” remarked the Virginian,

569
00:16:26,265 --> 00:16:29,564
innocently; and Scipio’s
sparkle gathered light.

570
00:16:29,564 --> 00:16:33,922
“As to my geography,”
he pursued, “that’s away out

571
00:16:33,922 --> 00:16:36,137
loose in the brush.

572
00:16:36,137 --> 00:16:38,777
Is Bennington the capital of Vermont?

573
00:16:38,777 --> 00:16:42,849
And how d’ yu’ spell bridegroom?”

574
00:16:42,849 --> 00:16:44,190
“Last point!”

575
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:47,402
shouted the Virginian,
letting a book fly after him:

576
00:16:47,402 --> 00:16:51,764
“don’t let badness and goodness worry
yu’, for yu’ll never be a judge of

577
00:16:51,764 --> 00:16:52,111
them.”

578
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:55,346
But Scipio had dodged the
book, and was gone.

579
00:16:55,346 --> 00:17:00,017
As he went his way, he said to himself,
“All the same, it must pay to

580
00:17:00,017 --> 00:17:01,752
fall regular in love.”

581
00:17:01,752 --> 00:17:08,561
At the bunk house that afternoon it was
observed that he was unusually silent.

582
00:17:08,561 --> 00:17:14,042
His exit from the foreman’s cabin had let
in a breath of winter so chill that the

583
00:17:14,042 --> 00:17:19,438
Virginian went to see his thermometer,
a Christmas present from Mrs. Henry.

584
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:22,135
It registered twenty below zero.

585
00:17:22,135 --> 00:17:26,836
After reviving the fire to a white blaze,
the foreman sat thinking over the story

586
00:17:26,836 --> 00:17:29,939
of Shorty: what its useless,
feeble past had been;

587
00:17:29,939 --> 00:17:32,752
what would be its useless, feeble
future.

588
00:17:32,752 --> 00:17:35,436
He shook his head over the sombre
question, Was there any

589
00:17:35,436 --> 00:17:36,798
way out for Shorty?

590
00:17:36,798 --> 00:17:41,228
“It may be,” he reflected,
“that them whose pleasure brings yu’

591
00:17:41,228 --> 00:17:44,473
into this world owes yu’ a living.

592
00:17:44,473 --> 00:17:48,652
But that don’t make the world responsible.

593
00:17:48,652 --> 00:17:50,782
The world did not beget you.

594
00:17:50,782 --> 00:17:55,546
I reckon man helps them
that help themselves.

595
00:17:55,546 --> 00:18:00,907
As for the universe, it looks like it did
too wholesale a business to turn out an

596
00:18:00,907 --> 00:18:03,948
article up to standard every clip.

597
00:18:03,948 --> 00:18:06,559
Yes, it is sorrowful.

598
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,857
For Shorty is kind to his hawss.”

599
00:18:08,857 --> 00:18:13,466
In the evening the Virginian brought
Shorty into his room.

600
00:18:13,466 --> 00:18:17,453
He usually knew what he had to say,
usually found it easy to arrange his

601
00:18:17,453 --> 00:18:23,034
thoughts; and after such arranging the
words came of themselves.

602
00:18:23,034 --> 00:18:28,253
But as he looked at Shorty,
this did not happen to him.

603
00:18:28,253 --> 00:18:34,108
There was not a line of badness in the
face; yet also there was not a line of

604
00:18:34,108 --> 00:18:40,188
strength; no promise in eye,
or nose, or chin; the whole thing melted

605
00:18:40,188 --> 00:18:44,405
to a stubby, featureless mediocrity.

606
00:18:44,405 --> 00:18:49,533
It was a countenance like thousands;
and hopelessness filled the Virginian as

607
00:18:49,533 --> 00:18:55,186
he looked at this lost dog,
and his dull, wistful eyes.

608
00:18:55,186 --> 00:18:58,350
But some beginning must be made.

609
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:02,865
“I wonder what the thermometer has got
to be,” he said.

610
00:19:02,865 --> 00:19:06,903
“Yu’ can see it, if yu’ll hold the lamp
to that right side of the window.”

611
00:19:06,903 --> 00:19:08,263
Shorty held the lamp.

612
00:19:08,263 --> 00:19:12,798
“I never used any,” he said,
looking out at the instrument,

613
00:19:12,798 --> 00:19:13,959
nevertheless.

614
00:19:13,959 --> 00:19:17,154
The Virginian had forgotten that
Shorty could not read.

615
00:19:17,154 --> 00:19:20,000
So he looked out of the window himself,
and found that it was

616
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,720
twenty-two below zero.

617
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:26,170
“This is pretty good tobacco,”
he remarked; and Shorty helped himself,

618
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:27,251
and filled his pipe.

619
00:19:27,251 --> 00:19:30,419
“I had to rub my left ear with
snow today,” said he.

620
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:31,863
“I was just in time.”

621
00:19:31,863 --> 00:19:35,922
“I thought it looked pretty freezy out
where yu’ was riding,” said the foreman.

622
00:19:35,922 --> 00:19:39,665
The lost dog’s eyes showed
plain astonishment.

623
00:19:39,665 --> 00:19:42,743
“We didn’t see you out there,” said he.

624
00:19:42,743 --> 00:19:47,991
“Well,” said the foreman,
“it’ll soon not be freezing any more;

625
00:19:47,991 --> 00:19:50,317
and then we’ll all be
warm enough with work.

626
00:19:50,317 --> 00:19:52,962
Everybody will be working
all over the range.

627
00:19:52,962 --> 00:19:57,268
And I wish I knew somebody that had a lot
of stable work to be attended to.

628
00:19:57,268 --> 00:19:59,317
I cert’nly do for your sake.”

629
00:19:59,317 --> 00:19:59,962
“Why?”

630
00:19:59,962 --> 00:20:00,816
said Shorty.

631
00:20:00,816 --> -1:59:59,000
“Because it’s the right kind of
a job for you.

632
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

633
00:20:03,413 --> 00:20:06,798
“I can make more⁠—” began
Shorty, and stopped.

634
00:20:06,798 --> 00:20:10,242
“There is a time coming,”
said the Virginian, “when I’ll want

635
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:13,672
somebody that knows how to get
the friendship of hawsses.

636
00:20:13,672 --> 00:20:18,061
I’ll want him to handle some special
hawsses the Judge has plans about.

637
00:20:18,061 --> 00:20:20,793
Judge Henry would pay fifty
a month for that.”

638
00:20:20,793 --> 00:20:24,704
“I can make more,” said Shorty,
this time with stubbornness.

639
00:20:24,704 --> 00:20:26,738
“Well, yes.

640
00:20:26,738 --> 00:20:30,145
Sometimes a man can⁠—when he’s not
worth it, I mean.

641
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:32,162
But it don’t generally last.”

642
00:20:32,162 --> 00:20:33,577
Shorty was silent.

643
00:20:33,577 --> 00:20:36,977
“I used to make more myself,”
said the Virginian.

644
00:20:36,977 --> 00:20:40,563
“You’re making a lot more
now,” said Shorty.

645
00:20:40,563 --> 00:20:41,482
“Oh, yes.

646
00:20:41,482 --> 00:20:47,291
But I mean when I was fooling around the
earth, jumping from job to job,

647
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:50,381
and helling all over town between
whiles.

648
00:20:50,381 --> 00:20:54,843
I was not worth fifty a month
then, nor twenty-five.

649
00:20:54,843 --> 00:20:58,204
But there was nights I made a
heap more at cyards.”

650
00:20:58,204 --> 00:21:00,585
Shorty’s eyes grew large.

651
00:21:00,585 --> 00:21:02,140
“And then, bang!

652
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:04,819
it was gone with treatin’ the
men and the girls.”

653
00:21:04,819 --> 00:21:09,450
“I don’t always⁠—” said
Shorty, and stopped again.

654
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:13,836
The Virginian knew that he was thinking
about the money he sent East.

655
00:21:13,836 --> 00:21:18,408
“After a while,” he continued,
“I noticed a right strange fact.

656
00:21:18,408 --> 00:21:22,473
The money I made easy that I wasn’t
worth, it went like it came.

657
00:21:22,473 --> 00:21:25,954
I strained myself none
gettin’ or spendin’ it.

658
00:21:25,954 --> 00:21:29,004
But the money I made hard that I was
worth, why I began to feel

659
00:21:29,004 --> 00:21:30,724
right careful about that.

660
00:21:30,724 --> 00:21:34,506
And now I have got savings stowed away.

661
00:21:34,506 --> 00:21:36,556
If once yu’ could know
how good that feels⁠—”

662
00:21:36,556 --> 00:21:39,960
“So I would know,” said
Shorty, “with your luck.”

663
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,583
“What’s my luck?”

664
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:43,002
said the Virginian, sternly.

665
00:21:43,002 --> 00:21:48,762
“Well, if I had took up land along a
creek that never goes dry and proved

666
00:21:48,762 --> 00:21:52,333
upon it like you have,
and if I had saw that land raise its

667
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:53,877
value on me with me lifting no finger⁠—”

668
00:21:53,877 --> 00:21:57,128
“Why did you lift no finger?”

669
00:21:57,128 --> 00:21:58,735
cut in the Virginian.

670
00:21:58,735 --> 00:22:00,714
“Who stopped yu’ taking up land?

671
00:22:00,714 --> 00:22:06,510
Did it not stretch in front of yu’,
behind yu’, all around yu’, the biggest,

672
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:08,335
baldest opportunity in sight?

673
00:22:08,335 --> 00:22:11,430
That was the time I lifted my
finger; but yu’ didn’t.”

674
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:12,902
Shorty stood stubborn.

675
00:22:12,902 --> 00:22:15,544
“But never mind that,” said the Virginian.

676
00:22:15,544 --> 00:22:19,970
“Take my land away tomorrow,
and I’d still have my savings in bank.

677
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:23,474
Because, you see, I had to work right
hard gathering them in.

678
00:22:23,474 --> 00:22:27,062
I found out what I could do,
and I settled down and did it.

679
00:22:27,062 --> 00:22:29,655
Now you can do that too.

680
00:22:29,655 --> 00:22:33,344
The only tough part is the finding out
what you’re good for.

681
00:22:33,344 --> 00:22:35,442
And for you, that is found.

682
00:22:35,442 --> 00:22:38,962
If you’ll just decide to work at this
thing you can do, and gentle those

683
00:22:38,962 --> 00:22:41,984
hawsses for the Judge,
you’ll be having savings

684
00:22:41,984 --> -1:59:59,000
in a bank yourself.

685
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

686
00:22:43,585 --> 00:22:46,662
“I can make more,” said the lost dog.

687
00:22:46,662 --> 00:22:49,856
The Virginian was on the point of
saying, “Then get out!”

688
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:53,118
But instead, he spoke kindness to the end.

689
00:22:53,118 --> 00:22:57,696
“The weather is freezing yet,”
he said, “and it will be for

690
00:22:57,696 --> 00:22:59,294
a good long while.

691
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:02,182
Take your time, and tell me if
yu’ change your mind.”

692
00:23:02,182 --> 00:23:06,258
After that Shorty returned to the bunk
house, and the Virginian knew that the

693
00:23:06,258 --> 00:23:10,339
boy had learned his lesson of discontent
from Trampas with a thoroughness

694
00:23:10,339 --> 00:23:11,782
past all unteaching.

695
00:23:11,782 --> 00:23:15,898
This petty triumph of evil seemed scarce
of the size to count as any

696
00:23:15,898 --> 00:23:17,686
victory over the Virginian.

697
00:23:17,686 --> 00:23:20,058
But all men grasp at straws.

698
00:23:20,058 --> 00:23:24,632
Since that first moment,
when in the Medicine Bow saloon the

699
00:23:24,632 --> 00:23:30,004
Virginian had shut the mouth of Trampas
by a word, the man had been trying to

700
00:23:30,004 --> 00:23:33,804
get even without risk;
and at each successive clash of his

701
00:23:33,804 --> 00:23:37,861
weapon with the Virginian’s,
he had merely met another

702
00:23:37,861 --> 00:23:39,967
public humiliation.

703
00:23:39,967 --> 00:23:45,901
Therefore, now at the Sunk Creek Ranch in
these cold white days,

704
00:23:45,901 --> 00:23:52,544
a certain lurking insolence in his gait
showed plainly his opinion that by

705
00:23:52,544 --> 00:23:57,589
disaffecting Shorty he had made
some sort of reprisal.

706
00:23:57,589 --> 00:24:00,052
Yes, he had poisoned the lost dog.

707
00:24:00,052 --> 00:24:04,335
In the springtime, when the neighboring
ranches needed additional hands,

708
00:24:04,335 --> 00:24:09,307
it happened as the Virginian had
foreseen⁠—Trampas departed to a “better

709
00:24:09,307 --> 00:24:15,700
job,” as he took pains to say,
and with him the docile Shorty rode away

710
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,850
upon his horse Pedro.

711
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:20,678
Love now was not any longer snowbound.

712
00:24:20,678 --> 00:24:23,933
The mountain trails were open enough for
the sure feet of love’s steed⁠—

713
00:24:23,933 --> 00:24:26,241
that horse called Monte.

714
00:24:26,241 --> 00:24:28,786
But duty blocked the path of love.

715
00:24:28,786 --> 00:24:33,113
Instead of turning his face to Bear
Creek, the foreman had other journeys to

716
00:24:33,113 --> 00:24:36,906
make, full of heavy work,
and watchfulness, and

717
00:24:36,906 --> 00:24:38,582
councils with the Judge.

718
00:24:38,582 --> 00:24:43,797
The cattle thieves were growing bold,
and winter had scattered the cattle

719
00:24:43,797 --> 00:24:45,899
widely over the range.

720
00:24:45,899 --> 00:24:49,111
Therefore the Virginian,
instead of going to see her,

721
00:24:49,111 --> 00:24:51,328
wrote a letter to his sweetheart.

722
00:24:51,328 --> 00:24:53,061
It was his first.

723
00:24:53,061 --> 00:24:54,560
CHAPTER XXIV

724
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,656
A Letter with a Moral

725
00:24:55,656 --> 00:25:00,502
The letter which the Virginian wrote to
Molly Wood was, as has been stated,

726
00:25:00,502 --> 00:25:02,443
the first that he had
ever addressed to her.

727
00:25:02,443 --> 00:25:07,235
I think, perhaps, he may have been a
little shy as to his skill in the

728
00:25:07,235 --> 00:25:13,593
epistolary art, a little anxious lest
any sustained production from his pen

729
00:25:13,593 --> 00:25:18,579
might contain blunders that would too
staringly remind her

730
00:25:18,579 --> 00:25:21,563
of his scant learning.

731
00:25:21,563 --> 00:25:27,263
He could turn off a business
communication about steers or stock

732
00:25:27,263 --> 00:25:32,981
cars, or any other of the subjects
involved in his profession,

733
00:25:32,981 --> 00:25:40,413
with a brevity and a clearness that led
the Judge to confide three-quarters of

734
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:43,256
such correspondence to his foreman.

735
00:25:43,256 --> 00:25:46,874
“Write to the 76 outfit,”
the Judge would say,

736
00:25:46,874 --> 00:25:50,133
“and tell them that my wagon cannot
start for the roundup until,”

737
00:25:50,133 --> 00:25:55,333
etc.; or “Write to Cheyenne and say that
if they will hold a meeting next Monday

738
00:25:55,333 --> 00:25:57,184
week, I will,” etc.

739
00:25:57,184 --> 00:26:01,368
And then the Virginian would write
such communications with ease.

740
00:26:01,368 --> 00:26:04,412
But his first message to his lady was
scarcely written with ease.

741
00:26:04,412 --> 00:26:07,401
It must be classed, I think,
among those productions which

742
00:26:07,401 --> 00:26:10,725
are styled literary efforts.

743
00:26:10,725 --> 00:26:14,885
It was completed in pencil before it was
copied in ink; and that first draft of

744
00:26:14,885 --> 00:26:19,198
it in pencil was well-nigh illegible
with erasures and amendments.

745
00:26:19,198 --> 00:26:23,358
The state of mind of the writer during
its composition may be gathered without

746
00:26:23,358 --> 00:26:28,522
further description on my part from a
slight interruption which

747
00:26:28,522 --> 00:26:29,727
occurred in the middle.

748
00:26:29,727 --> 00:26:32,322
The door opened, and Scipio
put his head in.

749
00:26:32,322 --> 00:26:33,792
“You coming to dinner?”

750
00:26:33,792 --> 00:26:35,172
he inquired.

751
00:26:35,172 --> 00:26:37,577
“You go to hell,” replied the Virginian.

752
00:26:37,577 --> 00:26:39,496
“My jinks!”

753
00:26:39,496 --> 00:26:42,676
said Scipio, quietly,
and he shut the door

754
00:26:42,676 --> 00:26:45,082
without further observation.

755
00:26:45,082 --> 00:26:50,711
To tell the truth, I doubt if this letter
would ever have been undertaken,

756
00:26:50,711 --> 00:26:54,588
far less completed and despatched,
had not the lover’s heart

757
00:26:54,588 --> 00:26:56,038
been wrung with disappointment.

758
00:26:56,038 --> 00:27:01,241
All winter long he had looked to that day
when he should knock at the girl’s door,

759
00:27:01,241 --> 00:27:03,201
and hear her voice bid him come in.

760
00:27:03,201 --> 00:27:07,417
All winter long he had been choosing the
ride he would take her.

761
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:11,961
He had imagined a sunny afternoon,
a hidden grove, a sheltering cleft of

762
00:27:11,961 --> 00:27:15,572
rock, a running spring,
and some words of his that should

763
00:27:15,572 --> 00:27:19,404
conquer her at last and leave
his lips upon hers.

764
00:27:19,404 --> 00:27:24,126
And with this controlled fire pent up
within him, he had counted the days,

765
00:27:24,126 --> 00:27:28,129
scratching them off his calendar with a
dig each night that once or

766
00:27:28,129 --> 00:27:29,724
twice snapped the pen.

767
00:27:29,724 --> 00:27:34,601
Then, when the trail stood open,
this meeting was deferred,

768
00:27:34,601 --> 00:27:40,922
put off for indefinite days,
or weeks; he could not tell how long.

769
00:27:40,922 --> 00:27:47,149
So, gripping his pencil and tracing heavy
words, he gave himself what consolation

770
00:27:47,149 --> 00:27:48,886
he could by writing her.

771
00:27:48,886 --> 00:27:55,532
The letter, duly stamped and addressed to
Bear Creek, set forth upon its travels;

772
00:27:55,532 --> 00:27:57,792
and these were devious and long.

773
00:27:57,792 --> 00:28:01,752
When it reached its destination,
it was some twenty days old.

774
00:28:01,752 --> 00:28:06,620
It had gone by private hand at the
outset, taken the stagecoach at a way

775
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:10,907
point, become late in that stagecoach,
reached a point of transfer,

776
00:28:10,907 --> 00:28:17,619
and waited there for the postmaster to
begin, continue, end,

777
00:28:17,619 --> 00:28:22,696
and recover from a game of
poker, mingled with whiskey.

778
00:28:22,696 --> 00:28:26,767
Then it once more proceeded,
was dropped at the right way point,

779
00:28:26,767 --> 00:28:29,171
and carried by private
hand to Bear Creek.

780
00:28:29,171 --> 00:28:34,063
The experience of this letter,
however, was not at all a remarkable one

781
00:28:34,063 --> 00:28:36,403
at that time in Wyoming.

782
00:28:36,403 --> 00:28:38,389
Molly Wood looked at the envelope.

783
00:28:38,389 --> 00:28:41,735
She had never before seen
the Virginian’s handwriting.

784
00:28:41,735 --> 00:28:43,529
She knew it instantly.

785
00:28:43,529 --> 00:28:47,425
She closed her door and sat down to read
it with a beating heart.

786
00:28:47,425 --> 00:28:48,616
Sunk Creek Ranch,

787
00:28:48,616 --> 00:28:50,994
May 5, 188‒

788
00:28:50,994 --> 00:28:52,939
My Dear Miss Wood:

789
00:28:52,939 --> 00:28:54,498
I am sorry about this.

790
00:28:54,498 --> 00:28:56,430
My plan was different.

791
00:28:56,430 --> 00:29:01,190
It was to get over for a ride with you
about now or sooner.

792
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:03,069
This year Spring is early.

793
00:29:03,069 --> 00:29:08,424
The snow is off the flats this side the
range and where the sun gets a chance to

794
00:29:08,424 --> 00:29:14,894
hit the earth strong all day it is green
and has flowers too, a good many.

795
00:29:14,894 --> 00:29:18,082
You can see them bob and mix
together in the wind.

796
00:29:18,082 --> 00:29:22,878
The quaking-asps down low on the South
side are in small leaf and will soon be

797
00:29:22,878 --> 00:29:24,988
twinkling like the flowers do now.

798
00:29:24,988 --> 00:29:29,708
I had planned to take a look at this with
you and that was a better plan than what

799
00:29:29,708 --> 00:29:30,694
I have got to do.

800
00:29:30,694 --> 00:29:34,708
The water is high but I could have got
over and as for the snow on top of the

801
00:29:34,708 --> 00:29:38,311
mountain a man told me nobody could
cross it for a week yet,

802
00:29:38,311 --> 00:29:40,113
because he had just done it himself.

803
00:29:40,113 --> 00:29:41,956
Was not he a funny man?

804
00:29:41,956 --> 00:29:45,188
You ought to see how the birds have
streamed across the sky

805
00:29:45,188 --> 00:29:46,761
while Spring was coming.

806
00:29:46,761 --> 00:29:50,320
But you have seen them on your
side of the mountain.

807
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:55,049
But I can’t come now Miss Wood.

808
00:29:55,049 --> 00:29:58,911
There is a lot for me to do that has to
be done and Judge Henry needs more than

809
00:29:58,911 --> 00:30:00,271
two eyes just now.

810
00:30:00,271 --> 00:30:05,086
I could not think much of myself if I
left him for my own wishes.

811
00:30:05,086 --> 00:30:07,500
But the days will be warmer when I come.

812
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:11,422
We will not have to quit by five,
and we can get off and sit too.

813
00:30:11,422 --> 00:30:15,302
We could not sit now unless for
a very short while.

814
00:30:15,302 --> 00:30:20,066
If I know when I can come I will try to
let you know, but I think it

815
00:30:20,066 --> 00:30:21,392
will be this way.

816
00:30:21,392 --> 00:30:26,631
I think you will just see me coming for I
have things to do of an unsure nature

817
00:30:26,631 --> 00:30:28,662
and a good number of such.

818
00:30:28,662 --> 00:30:31,219
Do not believe reports about Indians.

819
00:30:31,219 --> 00:30:35,583
They are started by editors to keep the
soldiers in the country.

820
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:40,238
The friends of the editors get the
hay and beef contracts.

821
00:30:40,238 --> 00:30:44,879
Indians do not come to settled parts
like Bear Creek is.

822
00:30:44,879 --> 00:30:48,542
It is all editors and politicianists.

823
00:30:48,542 --> 00:30:50,756
Nothing has happened worth telling you.

824
00:30:50,756 --> 00:30:53,733
I have read that play Othello.

825
00:30:53,733 --> 00:30:56,673
No man should write down such a thing.

826
00:30:56,673 --> 00:30:58,124
Do you know if it is true?

827
00:30:58,124 --> 00:31:01,026
I have seen one worse
affair down in Arizona.

828
00:31:01,026 --> 00:31:06,204
He killed his little child as well as his
wife but such things should not be put

829
00:31:06,204 --> 00:31:08,924
down in fine language for the public.

830
00:31:08,924 --> 00:31:11,176
I have read Romeo and Juliet.

831
00:31:11,176 --> 00:31:16,089
That is beautiful language but
Romeo is no man.

832
00:31:16,089 --> 00:31:20,268
I like his friend Mercutio
that gets killed.

833
00:31:20,268 --> 00:31:21,380
He is a man.

834
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:25,752
If he had got Juliet there would have
been no foolishness and trouble.

835
00:31:25,752 --> 00:31:28,530
Well Miss Wood I would like
to see you today.

836
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:33,770
Do you know what I think Monte would do
if I rode him out and let the rein

837
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:34,855
slack?

838
00:31:34,855 --> 00:31:39,252
He would come straight to your gate for
he is a horse of great judgement.

839
00:31:39,252 --> 00:31:42,223
(“That’s the first word he
has misspelled,” said Molly.)

840
00:31:42,223 --> 00:31:47,872
I suppose you are sitting with George
Taylor and those children right now.

841
00:31:47,872 --> 00:31:53,625
Then George will get old enough to help
his father but Uncle Hewie’s twins will

842
00:31:53,625 --> 00:31:57,912
be ready for you about then and the
supply will keep coming from all

843
00:31:57,912 --> 00:32:02,818
quarters all sizes for you to say big A
little a to them.

844
00:32:02,818 --> 00:32:04,447
There is no news here.

845
00:32:04,447 --> 00:32:10,132
Only calves and cows and the hens are
laying now which does always seem news

846
00:32:10,132 --> 00:32:12,053
to a hen every time she does it.

847
00:32:12,053 --> 00:32:15,534
Did I ever tell you about a hen
Emily we had here?

848
00:32:15,534 --> 00:32:21,586
She was venturesome to an extent I have
not seen in other hens only she had poor

849
00:32:21,586 --> 00:32:24,910
judgement and would make no family ties.

850
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:30,513
She would keep trying to get interest in
the ties of others taking charge of

851
00:32:30,513 --> 00:32:35,124
little chicks and bantams and turkeys
and puppies one time,

852
00:32:35,124 --> 00:32:37,711
and she thought most anything was an
egg.

853
00:32:37,711 --> 00:32:40,249
I will tell you about her sometime.

854
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:45,636
She died without family ties one day
while I was building a house for her

855
00:32:45,636 --> 00:32:46,901
to teach school in.

856
00:32:46,901 --> 00:32:48,875
(“The outrageous wretch!”

857
00:32:48,875 --> 00:32:49,815
cried Molly!

858
00:32:49,815 --> 00:32:55,167
And her cheeks turned deep pink as she
sat alone with her lover’s letter.)

859
00:32:55,167 --> 00:32:57,870
I am coming the first day I am free.

860
00:32:57,870 --> 00:33:02,510
I will be a hundred miles from you most
of the time when I am not more but I

861
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:07,211
will ride a hundred miles for one hour
and Monte is up to that.

862
00:33:07,211 --> 00:33:12,222
After never seeing you for so long I will
make one hour do if I have to.

863
00:33:12,222 --> 00:33:14,879
Here is a flower I have just
been out and picked.

864
00:33:14,879 --> 00:33:16,253
I have kissed it now.

865
00:33:16,253 --> 00:33:18,233
That is the best I can do yet.

866
00:33:18,233 --> 00:33:21,455
Molly laid the letter in her lap and
looked at the flower.

867
00:33:21,455 --> 00:33:27,096
Then suddenly she jumped up and pressed
it to her lips, and after a long moment

868
00:33:27,096 --> 00:33:28,527
held it away from her.

869
00:33:28,527 --> 00:33:30,008
“No,” she said.

870
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:30,949
“No, no, no.”

871
00:33:30,949 --> 00:33:32,051
She sat down.

872
00:33:32,051 --> 00:33:35,686
It was some time before
she finished the letter.

873
00:33:35,686 --> 00:33:39,115
Then once more she got up and
put on her hat.

874
00:33:39,115 --> 00:33:39,487
Mrs.

875
00:33:39,487 --> 00:33:43,660
Taylor wondered where the girl could
be walking so fast.

876
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:47,490
But she was not walking anywhere,
and in half an hour she returned,

877
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:53,002
rosy with her swift exercise,
but with a spirit as perturbed as when

878
00:33:53,002 --> 00:33:54,242
she had set out.

879
00:33:54,242 --> 00:33:58,333
Next morning at six, when she looked out
of her window, there was Monte tied

880
00:33:58,333 --> 00:33:59,573
to the Taylor’s gate.

881
00:33:59,573 --> 00:34:03,893
Ah, could he have come the day before,
could she have found him when she

882
00:34:03,893 --> 00:34:07,624
returned from that swift walk of hers!

883
00:34:07,624 --> 00:34:11,326
CHAPTER XXV

884
00:34:11,326 --> 00:34:12,866
Progress of the Lost Dog

885
00:34:12,866 --> 00:34:24,146
It was not even an hour’s visit that the
Virginian was able to pay his lady love.

886
00:34:25,295 --> 00:34:35,625
But neither had he come a hundred
miles to see her.

887
00:34:35,625 --> 00:34:41,610
The necessities of his wandering work had
chanced to bring him close enough for a

888
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:45,985
glimpse of her, and this glimpse he
took, almost on the wing.

889
00:34:45,985 --> 00:34:52,331
For he had to rejoin a company
of men at once.

890
00:34:52,331 --> 00:34:53,610
“Yu’ got my letter?”

891
00:34:53,610 --> 00:34:54,451
he said.

892
00:34:54,451 --> 00:34:55,572
“Yesterday.”

893
00:34:55,572 --> 00:34:56,841
“Yesterday!

894
00:34:56,841 --> 00:34:58,887
I wrote it three weeks ago.

895
00:34:58,887 --> 00:35:01,168
Well, yu’ got it.

896
00:35:01,168 --> 00:35:04,021
This cannot be the hour with
you that I mentioned.

897
00:35:04,021 --> 00:35:06,877
That is coming, and maybe very soon.”

898
00:35:06,877 --> 00:35:07,796
She could say nothing.

899
00:35:07,796 --> 00:35:11,807
Relief she felt, and yet with it
something like a pang.

900
00:35:11,807 --> 00:35:15,949
“Today does not count,”
he told her, “except that every time I

901
00:35:15,949 --> 00:35:17,633
see you counts with me.

902
00:35:17,633 --> 00:35:19,938
But this is not the hour
that I mentioned.”

903
00:35:19,938 --> 00:35:22,880
What little else was said between them
upon this early morning

904
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,560
shall be told duly.

905
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:30,363
For this visit in its own good time did
count momentously, though both of them

906
00:35:30,363 --> 00:35:33,353
took it lightly while
its fleeting minutes passed.

907
00:35:33,353 --> 00:35:39,118
He returned to her two volumes that she
had lent him long ago and with Taylor he

908
00:35:39,118 --> 00:35:42,405
left a horse which he had brought
for her to ride.

909
00:35:42,405 --> 00:35:46,037
As a goodbye, he put a bunch of
flowers in her hand.

910
00:35:46,037 --> 00:35:49,620
Then he was gone, and she watched him
going by the thick bushes

911
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:50,699
along the stream.

912
00:35:50,699 --> 00:35:54,822
They were pink with wild roses;
and the meadowlarks,

913
00:35:54,822 --> 00:35:58,296
invisible in the grass,
like hiding choristers,

914
00:35:58,296 --> 00:36:03,438
sent up across the empty miles of
air their unexpected song.

915
00:36:03,438 --> 00:36:07,794
Earth and sky had been propitious,
could he have stayed;

916
00:36:07,794 --> 00:36:12,144
and perhaps one portion of her heart
had been propitious too.

917
00:36:12,144 --> 00:36:16,794
So, as he rode away on Monte,
she watched him, half chilled by reason,

918
00:36:16,794 --> 00:36:21,498
half melted by passion,
self-thwarted, self-accusing,

919
00:36:21,498 --> 00:36:22,530
unresolved.

920
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:27,339
Therefore the days that came for her now
were all of them unhappy ones,

921
00:36:27,339 --> 00:36:33,546
while for him they were filled with work
well done and with changeless longing.

922
00:36:33,546 --> 00:36:37,162
One day it seemed as if a lull was
coming, a pause in which he could at

923
00:36:37,162 --> 00:36:39,304
last attain that hour with her.

924
00:36:39,304 --> 00:36:43,933
He left the camp and turned his
face toward Bear Creek.

925
00:36:43,933 --> 00:36:45,939
The way led him along Butte Creek.

926
00:36:45,939 --> 00:36:51,681
Across the stream lay Balaam’s large
ranch; and presently on the other bank

927
00:36:51,681 --> 00:36:55,545
he saw Balaam himself,
and reined in Monte for a moment to

928
00:36:55,545 --> 00:36:57,563
watch what Balaam was doing.

929
00:36:57,563 --> 00:37:00,817
“That’s what I’ve heard,”
he muttered to himself.

930
00:37:00,817 --> 00:37:05,257
For Balaam had led some horses to the
water, and was lashing them heavily

931
00:37:05,257 --> 00:37:07,560
because they would not drink.

932
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:11,900
He looked at this spectacle so intently
that he did not see Shorty

933
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:14,063
approaching along the trail.

934
00:37:14,063 --> 00:37:17,340
“Morning,” said Shorty to
him, with some constraint.

935
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:20,939
But the Virginian gave him a pleasant
greeting, “I was afraid I’d not catch

936
00:37:20,939 --> 00:37:23,162
you so quick,” said Shorty.

937
00:37:23,162 --> 00:37:24,397
“This is for you.”

938
00:37:24,397 --> 00:37:29,177
He handed his recent foreman a letter
of much battered appearance.

939
00:37:29,177 --> 00:37:30,711
It was from the Judge.

940
00:37:30,711 --> 00:37:35,953
It had not come straight,
but very gradually, in the pockets

941
00:37:35,953 --> 00:37:38,407
of three successive cowpunchers.

942
00:37:38,407 --> 00:37:44,649
As the Virginian glanced over it and saw
that the enclosure it contained was for

943
00:37:44,649 --> 00:37:47,693
Balaam, his heart fell.

944
00:37:47,693 --> 00:37:50,205
Here were new orders for him,
and he could not go to

945
00:37:50,205 --> 00:37:51,342
see his sweetheart.

946
00:37:51,342 --> 00:37:52,840
“Hello, Shorty!”

947
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:55,415
said Balaam, from over the creek.

948
00:37:55,415 --> 00:37:59,233
To the Virginian he gave a slight nod.

949
00:37:59,233 --> 00:38:05,005
He did not know him, although he knew
well enough who he was.

950
00:38:05,005 --> 00:38:08,627
“Hyeh’s a letter from Judge Henry for yu’
” said the Virginian,

951
00:38:08,627 --> 00:38:09,986
and he crossed the creek.

952
00:38:09,986 --> 00:38:16,443
Many weeks before, in the early spring,
Balaam had borrowed two horses from the

953
00:38:16,443 --> 00:38:19,998
Judge, promising to return them at once.

954
00:38:19,998 --> 00:38:24,177
But the Judge, of course,
wrote very civilly.

955
00:38:24,177 --> 00:38:27,678
He hoped that “this dunning
reminder” might be excused.

956
00:38:27,678 --> 00:38:30,250
As Balaam read the reminder,
he wished that he had

957
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:31,907
sent the horses before.

958
00:38:31,907 --> 00:38:35,208
The Judge was a greater man than
he in the Territory.

959
00:38:35,208 --> 00:38:39,832
Balaam could not but excuse the “dunning
reminder,”⁠—but he was ready to be

960
00:38:39,832 --> 00:38:42,597
disagreeable to somebody at once.

961
00:38:42,597 --> 00:38:47,686
“Well,” he said, musing aloud in his
annoyance, “Judge Henry wants

962
00:38:47,686 --> 00:38:48,840
them by the 30th.

963
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:52,125
Well, this is the 24th,
and time enough yet.”

964
00:38:52,125 --> 00:38:55,845
“This is the 27th,” said
the Virginian, briefly.

965
00:38:55,845 --> 00:38:58,136
That made a difference!

966
00:38:58,136 --> 00:39:02,791
Not so easy to reach Sunk Creek in good
order by the 30th!

967
00:39:02,791 --> 00:39:07,577
Balaam had drifted three sunrises behind
the progress of the month.

968
00:39:07,577 --> 00:39:12,017
Days look alike, and often lose their
very names in the quiet

969
00:39:12,017 --> 00:39:13,480
depths of Cattle Land.

970
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:16,504
The horses were not even
here at the ranch.

971
00:39:16,504 --> 00:39:19,394
Balaam was ready to be
very disagreeable now.

972
00:39:19,394 --> 00:39:22,483
Suddenly he perceived the date
of the Judge’s letter.

973
00:39:22,483 --> 00:39:25,555
He held it out to the Virginian,
and struck the paper.

974
00:39:25,555 --> 00:39:28,970
“What’s your idea in bringing this
here two weeks late?”

975
00:39:28,970 --> 00:39:29,666
he said.

976
00:39:29,666 --> 00:39:33,782
Now, when he had struck that paper,
Shorty looked at the Virginian.

977
00:39:33,782 --> 00:39:38,106
But nothing happened beyond a certain
change of light in the Southerner’s

978
00:39:38,106 --> 00:39:38,968
eyes.

979
00:39:38,968 --> 00:39:42,458
And when the Southerner spoke,
it was with his usual

980
00:39:42,458 --> 00:39:44,233
gentleness and civility.

981
00:39:44,233 --> 00:39:49,418
He explained that the letter had been put
in his hands just now by Shorty.

982
00:39:49,418 --> 00:39:51,218
“Oh,” said Balaam.

983
00:39:51,218 --> 00:39:52,578
He looked at Shorty.

984
00:39:52,578 --> 00:39:54,679
How had he come to be a messenger?

985
00:39:54,679 --> 00:39:57,808
“You working for the Sunk
Creek outfit again?”

986
00:39:57,808 --> 00:39:58,599
said he.

987
00:39:58,599 --> 00:40:00,399
“No,” said Shorty.

988
00:40:00,399 --> 00:40:04,762
Balaam turned to the Virginian again.

989
00:40:04,762 --> 00:40:08,500
“How do you expect me to get those horses
to Sunk Creek by the 30th?”

990
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:11,162
The Virginian levelled a
lazy eye on Balaam.

991
00:40:11,162 --> 00:40:13,917
“I ain’ doin’ any expecting,” said he.

992
00:40:13,917 --> 00:40:16,048
His native dialect was on top today.

993
00:40:16,048 --> 00:40:20,478
“The Judge has friends goin’ to arrive
from New Yawk for a trip across

994
00:40:20,478 --> 00:40:22,171
the Basin,” he added.

995
00:40:22,171 --> 00:40:23,569
“The hawsses are for them.”

996
00:40:23,569 --> 00:40:27,699
Balaam grunted with displeasure,
and thought of the sixty or seventy days

997
00:40:27,699 --> 00:40:30,979
since he had told the Judge he would
return the horses at once.

998
00:40:30,979 --> 00:40:35,259
He looked across at Shorty seated in the
shade, and through his uneasy thoughts

999
00:40:35,259 --> 00:40:39,530
his instinct irrelevantly noted what a
good pony the youth rode.

1000
00:40:39,530 --> 00:40:43,451
It was the same animal he had seen
once or twice before.

1001
00:40:43,451 --> 00:40:45,420
But something must be done.

1002
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:50,950
The Judge’s horses were far out on the
big range, and must be found and driven

1003
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:55,982
in, which would take certainly the rest
of this day, possibly part of the next.

1004
00:40:55,982 --> 00:41:01,759
Balaam called to one of his men and gave
some sharp orders, emphasizing details,

1005
00:41:01,759 --> 00:41:05,279
and enjoining haste,
while the Virginian leaned slightly

1006
00:41:05,279 --> 00:41:11,273
against his horse, with one arm over the
saddle, hearing and understanding,

1007
00:41:11,273 --> 00:41:12,975
but not smiling outwardly.

1008
00:41:12,975 --> 00:41:16,709
The man departed to saddle up for his
search on the big range,

1009
00:41:16,709 --> 00:41:19,239
and Balaam resumed the
unhitching of his team.

1010
00:41:19,239 --> 00:41:22,636
“So you’re not working for the
Sunk Creek outfit now?”

1011
00:41:22,636 --> 00:41:24,054
he inquired of Shorty.

1012
00:41:24,054 --> 00:41:25,787
He ignored the Virginian.

1013
00:41:25,787 --> 00:41:27,814
“Working for the Goose Egg?”

1014
00:41:27,814 --> 00:41:29,449
“No,” said Shorty.

1015
00:41:29,449 --> 00:41:31,191
“Sand Hill outfit, then?”

1016
00:41:31,191 --> 00:41:33,597
“No,” said Shorty.

1017
00:41:33,597 --> 00:41:36,015
Balaam grinned.

1018
00:41:36,015 --> 00:41:39,818
He noticed how Shorty’s yellow hair stuck
through a hole in his hat,

1019
00:41:39,818 --> 00:41:42,839
and how old and battered
were Shorty’s overalls.

1020
00:41:42,839 --> 00:41:47,130
Shorty had been glad to take a little
accidental pay for becoming the bearer

1021
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:50,781
of the letter which he had
delivered to the Virginian.

1022
00:41:50,781 --> 00:41:54,256
But even that sum was no
longer in his possession.

1023
00:41:54,256 --> 00:41:58,341
He had passed through Drybone on his way,
and at Drybone there had been

1024
00:41:58,341 --> 00:41:59,686
a game of poker.

1025
00:41:59,686 --> 00:42:02,459
Shorty’s money was now in
the pocket of Trampas.

1026
00:42:02,459 --> 00:42:06,094
But he had one valuable possession in the
world left to him, and that

1027
00:42:06,094 --> 00:42:07,412
was his horse Pedro.

1028
00:42:07,412 --> 00:42:10,800
“Good pony of yours,”
said Balaam to him now,

1029
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,272
from across Butte Creek.

1030
00:42:13,272 --> 00:42:17,576
Then he struck his own horse in the jaw
because he held back from coming to the

1031
00:42:17,576 --> 00:42:19,136
water as the other had done.

1032
00:42:19,136 --> 00:42:25,771
“Your trace ain’t unhitched,”
commented the Virginian, pointing.

1033
00:42:25,771 --> 00:42:29,571
Balaam loosed the strap he had forgotten,
and cut the horse again

1034
00:42:29,571 --> 00:42:31,368
for consistency’s sake.

1035
00:42:31,368 --> 00:42:35,096
The animal, bewildered,
now came down to the water,

1036
00:42:35,096 --> 00:42:38,055
with its head in the air,
and snuffing as it took

1037
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:39,844
short, nervous steps.

1038
00:42:39,844 --> 00:42:43,844
The Virginian looked on at
this, silent and sombre.

1039
00:42:43,844 --> 00:42:47,740
He could scarcely interfere between
another man and his own beast.

1040
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:54,201
Neither he nor Balaam was among those
who say their prayers.

1041
00:42:54,201 --> 00:42:56,961
Yet in this omission they were not equal.

1042
00:42:56,961 --> 00:43:03,817
A half-great poet once had a wholly great
day, and in that great day he was able

1043
00:43:03,817 --> 00:43:11,442
to write a poem that has lived and
become, with many, a household word.

1044
00:43:11,442 --> 00:43:15,885
He called it The Rime
of the Ancient Mariner.

1045
00:43:15,885 --> 00:43:19,787
And it is rich with many lines that
possess the memory; but these

1046
00:43:19,787 --> -1:59:59,000
are the golden ones:⁠

1047
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
—

1048
00:43:22,507 --> 00:43:27,331
“He prayeth well who loveth wellBoth man
and bird and beast.

1049
00:43:27,331 --> 00:43:33,357
He prayeth best who loveth bestAll things
both great and small;

1050
00:43:33,357 --> 00:43:41,647
For the dear God who loveth us,
He made and loveth all.”

1051
00:43:41,647 --> 00:43:43,704
These lines are the pure gold.

1052
00:43:43,704 --> 00:43:48,400
They are good to teach children;
because after the children come to be

1053
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:51,761
men, they may believe at least some
part of them still.

1054
00:43:51,761 --> 00:43:56,352
The Virginian did not know them⁠—but his
heart had taught him many things.

1055
00:43:56,352 --> 00:43:59,341
I doubt if Balaam knew them either.

1056
00:43:59,341 --> 00:44:02,641
But on him they would have been
as pearls to swine.

1057
00:44:02,641 --> 00:44:04,125
“So you’ve quit the roundup?”

1058
00:44:04,125 --> 00:44:05,353
he resumed to Shorty.

1059
00:44:05,353 --> 00:44:08,598
Shorty nodded and looked
sidewise at the Virginian.

1060
00:44:08,598 --> 00:44:11,752
For the Virginian knew that he had been
turned off for going to

1061
00:44:11,752 --> 00:44:14,359
sleep while night-herding.

1062
00:44:14,359 --> 00:44:17,591
Then Balaam threw another glance
on Pedro the horse.

1063
00:44:17,591 --> 00:44:19,425
“Hello, Shorty!”

1064
00:44:19,425 --> 00:44:22,127
he called out, for the boy was departing.

1065
00:44:22,127 --> 00:44:23,838
“Don’t you like dinner any more?

1066
00:44:23,838 --> 00:44:25,801
It’s ready about now.”

1067
00:44:25,801 --> 00:44:30,391
Shorty forded the creek and slung his
saddle off, and on invitation turned

1068
00:44:30,391 --> 00:44:34,819
Pedro, his buckskin pony,
into Balaam’s pasture.

1069
00:44:34,819 --> 00:44:39,333
This was green, the rest of the wide
world being yellow, except only where

1070
00:44:39,333 --> 00:44:44,064
Butte Creek, with its bordering
cottonwoods, coiled away into the desert

1071
00:44:44,064 --> 00:44:47,211
distance like a green snake without end.

1072
00:44:47,211 --> 00:44:50,815
The Virginian also turned his
horse into the pasture.

1073
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:55,440
He must stay at the ranch till the
Judge’s horses should be found.

1074
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:56,481
“Mrs.

1075
00:44:56,481 --> 00:45:02,034
Balaam’s East yet,” said her lord,
leading the way to his dining room.

1076
00:45:02,034 --> 00:45:05,996
He wanted Shorty to dine with him,
and could not exclude the Virginian,

1077
00:45:05,996 --> 00:45:07,897
much as he should have enjoyed this.

1078
00:45:07,897 --> 00:45:10,207
“See any Indians?”

1079
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:11,107
he enquired.

1080
00:45:11,107 --> 00:45:11,959
“Na-a!”

1081
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:16,229
said Shorty, in disdain of recent rumors.

1082
00:45:16,229 --> 00:45:19,989
“They’re headin’ the other
way,” observed the Virginian.

1083
00:45:19,989 --> 00:45:22,517
“Bow Laig Range is where
they was repawted.”

1084
00:45:22,517 --> 00:45:26,684
“What business have they got off the
reservation, I’d like to know,”

1085
00:45:26,684 --> 00:45:29,391
said the ranchman, “Bow
Leg, or anywhere?”

1086
00:45:29,391 --> 00:45:33,397
“Oh, it’s just a hunt,
and a kind of visitin’ their friends

1087
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:35,522
on the South Reservation

1088
00:45:35,522 --> 00:45:37,230
,” Shorty explained.

1089
00:45:37,230 --> 00:45:38,627
“Squaws along and all.”

1090
00:45:38,627 --> 00:45:42,960
“Well, if the folks at Washington don’t
keep squaws and all where they belong,”

1091
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:46,755
said Balaam, in a rage,
“the folks in Wyoming Territory ’ill do

1092
00:45:46,755 --> 00:45:49,121
a little job that way themselves.”

1093
00:45:49,121 --> 00:45:51,259
“There’s a petition out,” said Shorty.

1094
00:45:51,259 --> -1:59:59,000
“Paper’s goin’ East with a lot
of names to it

1095
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
.

1096
00:45:53,777 --> 00:45:56,960
But they ain’t no harm,
them Indians ain’t.”

1097
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:57,773
“No harm?”

1098
00:45:57,773 --> 00:45:59,244
rasped out Balaam.

1099
00:45:59,244 --> 00:46:03,482
“Was it white men druv
off the O.C. yearlings?”

1100
00:46:03,482 --> 00:46:07,877
Balaam’s Eastern grammar was sometimes at
the mercy of his Western feelings.

1101
00:46:07,877 --> 00:46:11,223
The thought of the perennial
stultification of Indian affairs at

1102
00:46:11,223 --> 00:46:15,747
Washington, whether by politician or
philanthropist, was always

1103
00:46:15,747 --> 00:46:17,042
sure to arouse him.

1104
00:46:17,042 --> 00:46:21,067
He walked impatiently about while he
spoke, and halted impatiently

1105
00:46:21,067 --> 00:46:22,279
at the window.

1106
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:27,388
Out in the world the unclouded day was
shining, and Balaam’s eye travelled

1107
00:46:27,388 --> 00:46:31,908
across the plains to where a blue line,
faint and pale, lay along the end of

1108
00:46:31,908 --> 00:46:34,087
the vast yellow distance.

1109
00:46:34,087 --> 00:46:37,966
That was the beginning of
the Bow Leg Mountains.

1110
00:46:37,966 --> 00:46:43,509
Somewhere over there were the red men,
ranging in unfrequented depths of rock

1111
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:46,740
and pine⁠—their forbidden ground.

1112
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:48,653
Dinner was ready, and they sat down.

1113
00:46:48,653 --> 00:46:52,632
“And I suppose,” Balaam continued,
still hot on the subject,

1114
00:46:52,632 --> 00:47:01,914
“you’d claim Indians object to killing a
white man when they run on to him good

1115
00:47:01,914 --> 00:47:06,399
and far from human help?

1116
00:47:06,399 --> 00:47:11,277
These peaceable Indians are just the
worst in the business.”

1117
00:47:11,277 --> 00:47:15,623
“That’s so,” assented the easy-opinioned
Shorty, exactly as if he had

1118
00:47:15,623 --> 00:47:17,943
always maintained this view.

1119
00:47:17,943 --> 00:47:21,023
“Chap started for Sunk
Creek three weeks ago.

1120
00:47:21,023 --> 00:47:25,814
Trapper he was; old like,
with a red shirt.

1121
00:47:25,814 --> 00:47:28,877
One of his horses come
into the roundup Toosday.

1122
00:47:28,877 --> 00:47:30,371
Man ain’t been heard from.”

1123
00:47:30,371 --> 00:47:34,830
He ate in silence for a while,
evidently brooding in his childlike

1124
00:47:34,830 --> 00:47:35,331
mind.

1125
00:47:35,331 --> 00:47:39,224
Then he said, querulously,
“I’d sooner trust one of them Indians

1126
00:47:39,224 --> 00:47:40,704
than I would Trampas.”

1127
00:47:40,704 --> 00:47:46,544
Balaam slanted his fat bullet head far to
one side, and laying his spoon down (he

1128
00:47:46,544 --> 00:47:50,928
had opened some canned grapes) laughed
steadily at his guest with a

1129
00:47:50,928 --> 00:47:54,658
harsh relish of irony.

1130
00:47:54,658 --> 00:47:59,269
The guest ate a grape,
and perceiving he was seen through,

1131
00:47:59,269 --> 00:48:01,518
smiled back rather miserably.

1132
00:48:01,518 --> 00:48:06,877
“Say, Shorty,” said Balaam,
his head still slanted over,

1133
00:48:06,877 --> 00:48:10,098
“what’s the figures of your
bank balance just now?”

1134
00:48:10,098 --> 00:48:13,664
“I ain’t usin’ banks,” murmured the youth.

1135
00:48:13,664 --> 00:48:17,904
Balaam put some more grapes on Shorty’s
plate, and drawing a cigar from his

1136
00:48:17,904 --> 00:48:21,288
waistcoat, sent it rolling to his guest.

1137
00:48:21,288 --> 00:48:24,251
“Matches are behind you,” he added.

1138
00:48:24,251 --> 00:48:29,568
He gave a cigar to the Virginian as an
afterthought, but to his disgust,

1139
00:48:29,568 --> 00:48:32,168
the Southerner put it in his pocket
and lighted a pipe.

1140
00:48:32,168 --> 00:48:36,640
Balaam accompanied his guest,
Shorty, when he went to the pasture to

1141
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:38,980
saddle up and depart.

1142
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:40,503
“Got a rope?”

1143
00:48:40,503 --> 00:48:43,817
he asked the guest, as they
lifted down the bars.

1144
00:48:43,817 --> 00:48:45,217
“Don’t need to rope him.

1145
00:48:45,217 --> 00:48:47,391
I can walk right up to Pedro.

1146
00:48:47,391 --> 00:48:48,353
You stay back.”

1147
00:48:48,353 --> 00:48:51,729
Hiding his bridle behind him,
Shorty walked to the riverbank,

1148
00:48:51,729 --> 00:48:54,929
where the pony was switching his long
tail in the shade; and speaking

1149
00:48:54,929 --> 00:48:59,013
persuasively to him,
he came nearer, till he laid his hand on

1150
00:48:59,013 --> 00:49:03,678
Pedro’s dusky mane, which was many
shades darker than his hide.

1151
00:49:03,678 --> 00:49:06,663
He turned expectantly,
and his master came up to his

1152
00:49:06,663 --> 00:49:09,567
expectations with a piece of bread.

1153
00:49:09,567 --> 00:49:11,027
“Eats that, does he?”

1154
00:49:11,027 --> 00:49:13,818
said Balaam, over the bars.

1155
00:49:13,818 --> 00:49:16,438
“Likes the salt,” said Shorty.

1156
00:49:16,438 --> 00:49:18,869
“Now, n-n-ow, here!

1157
00:49:18,869 --> 00:49:21,296
Yu’ don’t guess yu’ll
be bridled, don’t you?

1158
00:49:21,296 --> 00:49:23,641
Open your teeth!

1159
00:49:23,641 --> 00:49:27,815
Yu’d like to play yu’ was nobody’s
horse and live private?

1160
00:49:27,815 --> 00:49:31,072
Or maybe yu’d prefer ownin’ a saloon?”

1161
00:49:31,072 --> 00:49:36,094
Pedro evidently enjoyed this talk,
and the dodging he made about the bit.

1162
00:49:36,094 --> 00:49:39,807
Once fairly in his mouth,
he accepted the inevitable,

1163
00:49:39,807 --> 00:49:42,746
and followed Shorty to the bars.

1164
00:49:42,746 --> 00:49:46,732
Then Shorty turned and extended his hand.

1165
00:49:46,732 --> 00:49:47,381
“Shake!”

1166
00:49:47,381 --> 00:49:51,697
he said to his pony, who lifted his
forefoot quietly and put it

1167
00:49:51,697 --> 00:49:53,401
in his master’s hand.

1168
00:49:53,401 --> 00:49:58,675
Then the master tickled his nose,
and he wrinkled it and flattened his

1169
00:49:58,675 --> 00:50:01,051
ears, pretending to bite.

1170
00:50:01,051 --> 00:50:06,042
His face wore an expression of knowing
relish over this performance.

1171
00:50:06,042 --> 00:50:09,570
“Now the other hoof,”
said Shorty; and the horse and master

1172
00:50:09,570 --> 00:50:11,046
shook hands with their left.

1173
00:50:11,046 --> 00:50:14,552
“I learned him that,”
said the cowboy, with

1174
00:50:14,552 --> 00:50:16,161
pride and affection.

1175
00:50:16,161 --> 00:50:21,247
“Say, Pede,” he continued,
in Pedro’s ear, “ain’t yu’ the best

1176
00:50:21,247 --> 00:50:23,163
little horse in the country?

1177
00:50:23,163 --> 00:50:24,212
What?

1178
00:50:24,212 --> 00:50:25,428
Here, now!

1179
00:50:25,428 --> 00:50:27,775
Keep out of that, you deadbeat!

1180
00:50:27,775 --> 00:50:29,169
There ain’t no more bread.”

1181
00:50:29,169 --> 00:50:32,229
He pinched the pony’s nose,
one quarter of which was

1182
00:50:32,229 --> 00:50:33,669
wedged into his pocket.

1183
00:50:33,669 --> 00:50:36,151
“Quite a lady’s little pet!”

1184
00:50:36,151 --> 00:50:39,278
said Balaam, with the rasp in his voice.

1185
00:50:39,278 --> 00:50:41,833
“Pity this isn’t New York,
now, where there’s a big

1186
00:50:41,833 --> 00:50:43,944
market for harmless horses.

1187
00:50:43,944 --> 00:50:46,400
Gee-gees, the children call them.”

1188
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:50,077
“He ain’t no gee-gee,”
said Shorty, offended.

1189
00:50:50,077 --> 00:50:54,189
“He’ll beat any cow-pony
workin’ you’ve got.

1190
00:50:54,189 --> 00:50:58,425
Yu’ can turn him on a half-dollar.

1191
00:50:58,425 --> 00:51:00,759
Don’t need to touch the reins.

1192
00:51:00,759 --> 00:51:04,674
Hang ’em on one finger and swing your
body, and he’ll turn.”

1193
00:51:04,674 --> 00:51:08,709
Balaam knew this, and he knew that the
pony was only a four-year-old.

1194
00:51:08,709 --> 00:51:13,502
“Well,” he said, “Drybone’s had
no circus this season.

1195
00:51:13,502 --> 00:51:15,942
Maybe they’d buy tickets to see Pedro.

1196
00:51:15,942 --> 00:51:17,249
He’s good for that, anyway.”

1197
00:51:17,249 --> 00:51:19,208
Shorty became gloomy.

1198
00:51:19,208 --> 00:51:22,166
The Virginian was grimly smoking.

1199
00:51:22,166 --> 00:51:28,319
Here was something else going on not to
his taste, but none of his business.

1200
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:31,312
“Try a circus,” persisted Balaam.

1201
00:51:31,312 --> 00:51:35,404
“Alter your plans for spending cash in
town, and make a little money instead.”

1202
00:51:35,404 --> 00:51:40,215
Shorty having no plans to alter and no
cash to spend, grew still more gloomy.

1203
00:51:40,215 --> 00:51:41,978
“What’ll you take for that pony?”

1204
00:51:41,978 --> 00:51:42,989
said Balaam.

1205
00:51:42,989 --> 00:51:45,374
Shorty spoke up instantly.

1206
00:51:45,374 --> 00:51:49,491
“A hundred dollars couldn’t buy that
piece of stale mud off his back,”

1207
00:51:49,491 --> 00:51:54,600
he asserted, looking off
into the sky grandiosely.

1208
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:58,272
But Balaam looked at Shorty,
“You keep the mud,” he said,

1209
00:51:58,272 --> 00:52:01,213
“and I’ll give you thirty
dollars for the horse.”

1210
00:52:01,213 --> 00:52:04,306
Shorty did a little professional
laughing, and began to

1211
00:52:04,306 --> 00:52:05,542
walk toward his saddle.

1212
00:52:05,542 --> 00:52:09,729
“Give you thirty dollars,”
repeated Balaam, picking a stone up and

1213
00:52:09,729 --> 00:52:11,249
slinging it into the river.

1214
00:52:11,249 --> 00:52:13,100
“How far do yu’ call it to Drybone?”

1215
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:18,345
Shorty remarked, stooping to investigate
the bucking-strap on his saddle⁠—a

1216
00:52:18,345 --> 00:52:21,879
superfluous performance,
for Pedro never bucked.

1217
00:52:21,879 --> 00:52:24,332
“You won’t have to walk,” said Balaam.

1218
00:52:24,332 --> 00:52:27,790
“Stay all night, and I’ll send you over
comfortably in the morning,

1219
00:52:27,790 --> 00:52:29,475
when the wagon goes for the mail.”

1220
00:52:29,475 --> 00:52:30,745
“Walk?”

1221
00:52:30,745 --> 00:52:31,853
Shorty retorted.

1222
00:52:31,853 --> 00:52:34,531
“Drybone’s twenty-five miles.

1223
00:52:34,531 --> 00:52:37,794
Pedro’ll put me there in three hours and
not know he done it.”

1224
00:52:37,794 --> 00:52:39,865
He lifted the saddle on the horse’s back.

1225
00:52:39,865 --> 00:52:41,572
“Come, Pedro,” said he.

1226
00:52:41,572 --> 00:52:43,086
“Come, Pedro!”

1227
00:52:43,086 --> 00:52:44,557
mocked Balaam.

1228
00:52:44,557 --> 00:52:46,969
There followed a little silence.

1229
00:52:46,969 --> 00:52:51,871
“No, sir,” mumbled Shorty,
with his head under Pedro’s

1230
00:52:51,871 --> 00:52:54,524
belly, busily cinching.

1231
00:52:54,524 --> 00:52:57,925
“A hundred dollars is bottom figures.”

1232
00:52:57,925 --> 00:53:02,866
Balaam, in his turn, now duly performed
some professional laughing,

1233
00:53:02,866 --> 00:53:06,676
which was noted by Shorty
under the horse’s belly.

1234
00:53:06,676 --> 00:53:09,528
He stood up and squared round on Balaam.

1235
00:53:09,528 --> 00:53:13,151
“Well, then,” he said,
“what’ll yu give for him?”

1236
00:53:13,151 --> 00:53:17,805
“Thirty dollars,” said Balaam,
looking far off into the sky,

1237
00:53:17,805 --> 00:53:18,914
as Shorty had looked.

1238
00:53:18,914 --> 00:53:21,945
“Oh, come, now,” expostulated Shorty.

1239
00:53:21,945 --> 00:53:26,065
It was he who now did the feeling for an
offer and this was what

1240
00:53:26,065 --> 00:53:27,322
Balaam liked to see.

1241
00:53:27,322 --> 00:53:30,985
“Why yes,” he said, “thirty,”
and looked surprised that he should have

1242
00:53:30,985 --> 00:53:32,625
to mention the sum so often.

1243
00:53:32,625 --> 00:53:36,336
“I thought yu’d quit them first figures,”
said the cowpuncher,

1244
00:53:36,336 --> 00:53:39,136
“for yu’ can see I ain’t goin’
to look at em.”

1245
00:53:39,136 --> 00:53:43,830
Balaam climbed on the fence and sat there
“I’m not crying for your

1246
00:53:43,830 --> 00:53:46,440
Pedro,” he observed dispassionately.

1247
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:52,194
“Only it struck me you were dead broke,
and wanted to raise cash and keep

1248
00:53:52,194 --> 00:53:56,871
yourself going till you hunted up a job
and could buy him back.”

1249
00:53:56,871 --> 00:54:00,074
He hooked his right thumb
inside his waistcoat pocket.

1250
00:54:00,074 --> 00:54:03,221
“But I’m not cryin’ for him,” he repeated.

1251
00:54:03,221 --> 00:54:05,778
“He’d stay right here, of course.

1252
00:54:05,778 --> 00:54:10,665
I wouldn’t part with him.

1253
00:54:10,665 --> 00:54:12,679
Why does he stand that way?

1254
00:54:12,679 --> 00:54:13,325
Hello!”

1255
00:54:13,325 --> 00:54:16,976
Balaam suddenly straightened himself,
like a man who has made a discovery.

1256
00:54:16,976 --> 00:54:18,588
“Hello, what?”

1257
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:20,946
said Shorty, on the defensive.

1258
00:54:20,946 --> 00:54:25,079
Balaam was staring at Pedro
with a judicial frown.

1259
00:54:25,079 --> 00:54:29,622
Then he stuck out a finger at the horse,
keeping the thumb hooked in his pocket.

1260
00:54:29,622 --> 00:54:35,899
So meagre a gesture was felt by the
ruffled Shorty to be no just way

1261
00:54:35,899 --> 00:54:37,012
to point at Pedro.

1262
00:54:37,012 --> 00:54:38,968
“What’s the matter with
that foreleg there?”

1263
00:54:38,968 --> 00:54:39,968
said Balaam.

1264
00:54:39,968 --> 00:54:41,196
“Which?

1265
00:54:41,196 --> 00:54:42,977
Nothin’s the matter with it!”

1266
00:54:42,977 --> 00:54:43,887
snapped Shorty.

1267
00:54:43,887 --> 00:54:49,624
Balaam climbed down from his fence and
came over with elaborate deliberation.

1268
00:54:49,624 --> 00:54:54,820
He passed his hand up and
down the off foreleg.

1269
00:54:54,820 --> 00:54:58,048
Then he spit slenderly.

1270
00:54:58,048 --> 00:54:59,377
“Mm!”

1271
00:54:59,377 --> 00:55:03,427
he said thoughtfully;
and added, with a shade of sadness,

1272
00:55:03,427 --> 00:55:06,871
“that’s always to be expected when
they’re worked too young.”

1273
00:55:06,871 --> 00:55:10,644
Shorty slid his hand slowly
over the disputed leg.

1274
00:55:10,644 --> 00:55:12,326
“What’s to be expected?”

1275
00:55:12,326 --> 00:55:14,613
he inquired⁠—“that they’ll eat hearty?

1276
00:55:14,613 --> -1:59:59,000
Well, he does.

1277
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

1278
00:55:15,690 --> 00:55:20,683
At this retort the Virginian permitted
himself to laugh in audible sympathy.

1279
00:55:20,683 --> 00:55:23,910
“Sprung,” continued Balaam, with a sigh.

1280
00:55:23,910 --> 00:55:27,774
“Whirling round short when his bones
were soft did that.

1281
00:55:27,774 --> 00:55:28,616
Yes.”

1282
00:55:28,616 --> 00:55:29,990
“Sprung!”

1283
00:55:29,990 --> 00:55:32,480
Shorty said, with a bark of indignation.

1284
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:35,479
“Come on, Pede; you and
me’ll spring for town.”

1285
00:55:35,479 --> 00:55:40,044
He caught the horn of the saddle,
and as he swung into place the horse

1286
00:55:40,044 --> 00:55:41,684
rushed away with him.

1287
00:55:41,684 --> 00:55:42,551
“O-ee!

1288
00:55:42,551 --> 00:55:44,358
yoi-yup, yup, yup!”

1289
00:55:44,358 --> 00:55:47,822
sang Shorty, in the shrill cow dialect.

1290
00:55:47,822 --> 00:55:52,690
He made Pedro play an exhibition game of
speed, bringing him round close to

1291
00:55:52,690 --> 00:55:56,050
Balaam in a wide circle,
and then he vanished in dust down

1292
00:55:56,050 --> 00:55:57,290
the left-bank trail.

1293
00:55:57,290 --> 00:55:59,850
Balaam looked after him
and laughed harshly.

1294
00:55:59,850 --> 00:56:03,010
He had seen trout dash about like that
when the hook in their

1295
00:56:03,010 --> 00:56:04,806
jaw first surprised them.

1296
00:56:04,806 --> 00:56:09,330
He knew Shorty would show the pony off,
and he knew Shorty’s love for Pedro was

1297
00:56:09,330 --> 00:56:11,313
not equal to his need of money.

1298
00:56:11,313 --> 00:56:14,570
He called to one of his men,
asked something about the dam at the

1299
00:56:14,570 --> 00:56:19,169
mouth of the canyon,
where the main irrigation ditch began,

1300
00:56:19,169 --> 00:56:23,128
made a remark about the prolonged
drought, and then walked to his dining-

1301
00:56:23,128 --> 00:56:26,960
room door, where, as he
expected, Shorty met him.

1302
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:29,640
“Say,” said the youth,
“do you consider that’s any way to talk

1303
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:31,650
about a good horse?”

1304
00:56:31,650 --> 00:56:34,845
“Any dude could see the
leg’s sprung,” said Balaam.

1305
00:56:34,845 --> 00:56:37,645
But he looked at Pedro’s shoulder,
which was well laid back;

1306
00:56:37,645 --> 00:56:42,019
and he admired his points,
dark in contrast with the buckskin,

1307
00:56:42,019 --> 00:56:44,216
and also the width between the eyes.

1308
00:56:44,216 --> 00:56:47,856
“Now you know,” whined Shorty,
“that it ain’t sprung any more

1309
00:56:47,856 --> 00:56:49,376
than your leg’s cork.

1310
00:56:49,376 --> 00:56:53,926
If you mean the right leg ain’t plumb
straight, I can tell you he was born so.

1311
00:56:53,926 --> 00:56:57,148
That don’t make no difference,
for it ain’t weak.

1312
00:56:57,148 --> 00:56:58,559
Try him onced.

1313
00:56:58,559 --> 00:57:02,282
Just as sound and strong as iron.

1314
00:57:02,282 --> 00:57:04,007
Never stumbles.

1315
00:57:04,007 --> 00:57:07,329
And he don’t never go to jumpin’ with yu’.

1316
00:57:07,329 --> 00:57:09,179
He’s kind and he’s smart.”

1317
00:57:09,179 --> 00:57:13,348
And the master petted his pony,
who lifted a hoof for another handshake.

1318
00:57:13,348 --> 00:57:17,427
Of course Balaam had never thought the
leg was sprung, and he now took on an

1319
00:57:17,427 --> 00:57:22,685
unprejudiced air of wanting to believe
Shorty’s statements if he only could.

1320
00:57:22,685 --> 00:57:27,015
“Maybe there’s two years’ work left in
that leg,” he now observed.

1321
00:57:27,015 --> 00:57:29,827
“Better give your hawss away,
Shorty,” said the Virginian.

1322
00:57:29,827 --> 00:57:31,667
“Is this your deal, my friend?”

1323
00:57:31,667 --> 00:57:32,947
inquired Balaam.

1324
00:57:32,947 --> 00:57:35,865
And he slanted his bullet
head at the Virginian.

1325
00:57:35,865 --> 00:57:38,925
“Give him away, Shorty,”
drawled the Southerner.

1326
00:57:38,925 --> 00:57:40,273
“His laig is busted.

1327
00:57:40,273 --> 00:57:40,709
Mr.

1328
00:57:40,709 --> 00:57:42,072
Balaam says so.”

1329
00:57:42,072 --> 00:57:45,015
Balaam’s face grew evil with baffled fury.

1330
00:57:45,015 --> 00:57:48,818
But the Virginian was
gravely considering Pedro.

1331
00:57:48,818 --> 00:57:52,059
He, too, was not pleased.

1332
00:57:52,059 --> 00:57:53,616
But he could not interfere.

1333
00:57:53,616 --> 00:57:57,522
Already he had overstepped the
code in these matters.

1334
00:57:57,522 --> 00:58:03,549
He would have dearly liked⁠—for reasons
good and bad, spite and mercy mingled⁠—

1335
00:58:03,549 --> 00:58:03,586
to

1336
00:58:03,586 --> 00:58:08,568
have spoiled Balaam’s market,
to have offered a reasonable or even an

1337
00:58:08,568 --> 00:58:11,448
unreasonable price for Pedro,
and taken possession

1338
00:58:11,448 --> 00:58:13,601
of the horse himself.

1339
00:58:13,601 --> 00:58:15,613
But this might not be.

1340
00:58:15,613 --> 00:58:21,177
In bets, in card games,
in all horse transactions and other

1341
00:58:21,177 --> 00:58:26,586
matters of similar business,
a man must take care of himself,

1342
00:58:26,586 --> 00:58:32,558
and wiser onlookers must suppress their
wisdom and hold their peace.

1343
00:58:32,558 --> 00:58:34,524
That evening Shorty again had a cigar.

1344
00:58:34,524 --> 00:58:39,180
He had parted with Pedro for forty
dollars, a striped Mexican blanket,

1345
00:58:39,180 --> 00:58:41,229
and a pair of spurs.

1346
00:58:41,229 --> 00:58:45,217
Undressing over in the bunk house,
he said to the Virginian,

1347
00:58:45,217 --> 00:58:50,345
“I’ll sure buy Pedro back off him just
as soon as ever I rustle some cash.”

1348
00:58:50,345 --> 00:58:51,618
The Virginian grunted.

1349
00:58:51,618 --> 00:58:55,145
He was thinking he should have to travel
hard to get the horses to the Judge by

1350
00:58:55,145 --> 00:58:59,305
the 30th; and below that thought lay his
aching disappointment and his

1351
00:58:59,305 --> 00:59:00,945
longing for Bear Creek.

1352
00:59:00,945 --> 00:59:05,865
In the early dawn Shorty sat up among his
blankets on the floor of the bunk house

1353
00:59:05,865 --> 00:59:09,343
and saw the various sleepers coiled or
sprawled in their beds;

1354
00:59:09,343 --> 00:59:12,799
their breathing had not yet grown
restless at the nearing of day.

1355
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:16,671
He stepped to the door carefully,
and saw the crowding blackbirds begin

1356
00:59:16,671 --> 00:59:20,707
their walk and chatter in the mud of the
littered and trodden corrals.

1357
00:59:20,707 --> 00:59:26,228
From beyond among the cottonwoods,
came continually the smooth unemphatic

1358
00:59:26,228 --> 00:59:30,348
sound of the doves answering each other
invisibly; and against the empty ridge

1359
00:59:30,348 --> 00:59:34,664
of the river-bluff lay the moon,
no longer shining, for there was

1360
00:59:34,664 --> 00:59:38,031
established a new light through the sky.

1361
00:59:38,031 --> 00:59:41,042
Pedro stood in the pasture
close to the bars.

1362
00:59:41,042 --> 00:59:45,297
The cowboy slowly closed the door behind
him, and sitting down on the step,

1363
00:59:45,297 --> 00:59:49,495
drew his money out and idly handled it,
taking no comfort just

1364
00:59:49,495 --> 00:59:50,921
then from its possession.

1365
00:59:50,921 --> 00:59:55,998
Then he put it back, and after dragging
on his boots, crossed to the pasture,

1366
00:59:55,998 --> 01:00:01,777
and held a last talk with his pony,
brushing the cakes of mud from his hide

1367
01:00:01,777 --> 01:00:04,196
where he had rolled,
and passing a lingering

1368
01:00:04,196 --> 01:00:05,648
hand over his mane.

1369
01:00:05,648 --> 01:00:10,041
As the sounds of the morning came
increasingly from tree and plain,

1370
01:00:10,041 --> 01:00:13,714
Shorty glanced back to see that no one
was yet out of the cabin,

1371
01:00:13,714 --> 01:00:17,663
and then put his arms round the horse’s
neck, laying his head against him.

1372
01:00:17,663 --> 01:00:23,956
For a moment the cowboy’s insignificant
face was exalted by the emotion he would

1373
01:00:23,956 --> 01:00:26,155
never have let others see.

1374
01:00:26,155 --> 01:00:30,609
He hugged tight this animal,
who was dearer to his heart than

1375
01:00:30,609 --> 01:00:32,809
anybody in the world.

1376
01:00:32,809 --> -1:59:59,000
“Goodbye, Pedro,” he said⁠—“goodbye.

1377
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

1378
01:00:39,672 --> 01:00:41,770
Pedro looked for bread.

1379
01:00:41,770 --> 01:00:46,242
“No,” said his master,
sorrowfully, “not any more.

1380
01:00:46,242 --> 01:00:48,871
Yu’ know well I’d give it yu’ if I had it.

1381
01:00:48,871 --> 01:00:51,963
You and me didn’t figure on
this, did we, Pedro?

1382
01:00:51,963 --> 01:00:52,641
Goodbye!”

1383
01:00:52,641 --> 01:00:55,977
He hugged his pony again,
and got as far as the bars of the

1384
01:00:55,977 --> 01:00:58,057
pasture, but returned once more.

1385
01:00:58,057 --> 01:01:02,080
“Goodbye, my little horse,
my dear horse, my little,

1386
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:06,345
little Pedro,” he said,
as his tears wet the pony’s neck.

1387
01:01:06,345 --> 01:01:10,321
Then he wiped them with his hand,
and got himself back to the bunk house.

1388
01:01:10,321 --> 01:01:13,730
After breakfast he and his belongings
departed to Drybone,

1389
01:01:13,730 --> 01:01:18,201
and Pedro from his field calmly watched
this departure; for horses must

1390
01:01:18,201 --> 01:01:23,601
recognize even less than men the black
corners that their destinies turn.

1391
01:01:23,601 --> 01:01:27,802
The pony stopped feeding to look at the
mail-wagon pass by; but the master

1392
01:01:27,802 --> 01:01:31,641
sitting in the wagon forebore
to turn his head.

1393
01:01:31,641 --> 01:01:32,760
CHAPTER XXVI

1394
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:34,416
Balaam and Pedro

1395
01:01:34,416 --> 01:01:39,476
Resigned to wait for the Judge’s horses,
Balaam went into his office this dry,

1396
01:01:39,476 --> 01:01:44,162
bright morning and read nine accumulated
newspapers; for he was behindhand.

1397
01:01:44,162 --> 01:01:49,200
Then he rode out on the ditches,
and met his man returning with the

1398
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:52,002
troublesome animals at last.

1399
01:01:52,002 --> 01:01:54,642
He hastened home and sent
for the Virginian.

1400
01:01:54,642 --> 01:01:55,951
He had made a decision.

1401
01:01:55,951 --> 01:01:59,553
“See here,” he said; “those
horses are coming.

1402
01:01:59,553 --> 01:02:02,760
What trail would you take
over to the Judge’s?”

1403
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:08,852
“Shortest trail’s right through the Bow
Laig Mountains,” said the foreman,

1404
01:02:08,852 --> 01:02:11,430
in his gentle voice.

1405
01:02:11,430 --> 01:02:13,349
“Guess you’re right.

1406
01:02:13,349 --> 01:02:15,469
It’s dinnertime.

1407
01:02:15,469 --> 01:02:18,149
We’ll start right afterward.

1408
01:02:18,149 --> 01:02:22,946
We’ll make Little Muddy Crossing by
sundown, and Sunk Creek tomorrow,

1409
01:02:22,946 --> 01:02:25,606
and the next day’ll see us through.

1410
01:02:25,606 --> 01:02:27,649
Can a wagon get through
Sunk Creek Canyon?”

1411
01:02:27,649 --> 01:02:29,051
The Virginian smiled.

1412
01:02:29,051 --> 01:02:32,756
“I reckon it can’t, seh,
and stay resembling a wagon.”

1413
01:02:32,756 --> 01:02:37,996
Balaam told them to saddle Pedro and one
packhorse, and drive the bunch of horses

1414
01:02:37,996 --> 01:02:43,197
into a corral, roping the Judge’s two,
who proved extremely wild.

1415
01:02:43,197 --> 01:02:47,981
He had decided to take this journey
himself on remembering certain politics

1416
01:02:47,981 --> 01:02:50,124
soon to be rife in Cheyenne.

1417
01:02:50,124 --> 01:02:53,843
For Judge Henry was indeed a
greater man than Balaam.

1418
01:02:53,843 --> 01:02:59,404
This personally conducted return of the
horses would temper its tardiness,

1419
01:02:59,404 --> 01:03:05,349
and, moreover, the sight of some New
York visitors would be a good thing

1420
01:03:05,349 --> 01:03:10,944
after seven months of no warmer touch
with that metropolis than the Sunday

1421
01:03:10,944 --> 01:03:16,518
Herald, always eight days old when it
reached the Butte Creek Ranch.

1422
01:03:16,518 --> 01:03:21,233
They forded Butte Creek,
and, crossing the well-travelled trail

1423
01:03:21,233 --> 01:03:24,753
which follows down to Drybone,
turned their faces toward the

1424
01:03:24,753 --> 01:03:28,513
uninhabited country that began
immediately, as the ocean begins

1425
01:03:28,513 --> 01:03:29,993
off a sandy shore.

1426
01:03:29,993 --> 01:03:34,913
And as a single mast on which no sail is
shining stands at the horizon and seems

1427
01:03:34,913 --> 01:03:40,615
to add a loneliness to the surrounding
sea, so the long gray line of fence,

1428
01:03:40,615 --> 01:03:45,249
almost a mile away, that ended Balaam’s
land on this side the creek,

1429
01:03:45,249 --> 01:03:50,381
stretched along the waste ground and
added desolation to the plain.

1430
01:03:50,381 --> 01:03:56,598
No solitary watercourse with margin of
cottonwoods or willow thickets flowed

1431
01:03:56,598 --> 01:04:01,872
here to stripe the dingy,
yellow world with interrupting green,

1432
01:04:01,872 --> 01:04:06,415
nor were cattle to be seen dotting the
distance, nor moving objects at all,

1433
01:04:06,415 --> 01:04:11,311
nor any bird in the soundless air.

1434
01:04:11,311 --> 01:04:15,085
The last gate was shut by the Virginian,
who looked back at the pleasant trees of

1435
01:04:15,085 --> 01:04:19,498
the ranch, and then followed on in
single file across the alkali

1436
01:04:19,498 --> 01:04:20,953
of No Man’s Land.

1437
01:04:20,953 --> 01:04:23,136
No cloud was in the sky.

1438
01:04:23,136 --> 01:04:28,280
The desert’s grim noon shone sombrely
on flat and hill.

1439
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:31,583
The sagebrush was dull like zinc.

1440
01:04:31,583 --> 01:04:36,165
Thick heat rose near at hand from the
caked alkali, and pale heat

1441
01:04:36,165 --> 01:04:38,044
shrouded the distant peaks.

1442
01:04:38,044 --> 01:04:39,797
There were five horses.

1443
01:04:39,797 --> 01:04:43,676
Balaam led on Pedro, his squat figure
stiff in the saddle,

1444
01:04:43,676 --> 01:04:46,601
but solid as a rock,
and tilted a little forward,

1445
01:04:46,601 --> 01:04:47,888
as his habit was.

1446
01:04:47,888 --> 01:04:52,779
One of the Judge’s horses came next,
a sorrel, dragging back continually on

1447
01:04:52,779 --> 01:04:54,819
the rope by which he was led.

1448
01:04:54,819 --> 01:04:58,859
After him ambled Balaam’s wise pack-
animal, carrying the light burden of two

1449
01:04:58,859 --> 01:05:01,231
days’ food and lodging.

1450
01:05:01,231 --> 01:05:05,511
She was an old mare who could still go
when she chose, but had been schooled by

1451
01:05:05,511 --> 01:05:09,761
the years, and kept the trail,
giving no trouble to the Virginian

1452
01:05:09,761 --> 01:05:10,776
who came behind her.

1453
01:05:10,776 --> 01:05:15,425
He also sat solid as a rock,
yet subtly bending to the struggles of

1454
01:05:15,425 --> 01:05:20,986
the wild horse he led,
as a steel spring bends and balances

1455
01:05:20,986 --> 01:05:22,434
and resumes its poise.

1456
01:05:22,434 --> 01:05:27,299
Thus they made but slow time,
and when they topped the last dull rise

1457
01:05:27,299 --> 01:05:34,046
of ground and looked down on the long
slant of ragged, caked earth to the

1458
01:05:34,046 --> 01:05:38,526
crossing of Little Muddy,
with its single tree and few mean

1459
01:05:38,526 --> 01:05:43,948
bushes, the final distance where
eyesight ends had deepened to violet

1460
01:05:43,948 --> 01:05:47,855
from the thin, steady blue they had
stared at for so many hours,

1461
01:05:47,855 --> 01:05:51,438
and all heat was gone
from the universal dryness.

1462
01:05:51,438 --> 01:05:55,072
The horses drank a long time from the
sluggish yellow water,

1463
01:05:55,072 --> 01:05:59,885
and its alkaline taste and warmth were
equally welcome to the men.

1464
01:05:59,885 --> 01:06:03,220
They built a little fire,
and when supper was ended,

1465
01:06:03,220 --> 01:06:08,295
smoked but a short while and in silence,
before they got in the blankets that

1466
01:06:08,295 --> 01:06:11,352
were spread in a smooth
place beside the water.

1467
01:06:11,352 --> 01:06:15,535
They had picketed the two horses of the
Judge in the best grass they could find,

1468
01:06:15,535 --> 01:06:19,376
letting the rest go free to find
pasture where they could.

1469
01:06:19,376 --> 01:06:23,445
When the first light came,
the Virginian attended to breakfast,

1470
01:06:23,445 --> 01:06:27,576
while Balaam rode away on the sorrel to
bring in the loose horses.

1471
01:06:27,576 --> 01:06:31,199
They had gone far out of sight,
and when he returned with them,

1472
01:06:31,199 --> 01:06:34,073
after some two hours, he was on Pedro.

1473
01:06:34,073 --> 01:06:38,138
Pedro was soaking with sweat,
and red froth creamed from his mouth.

1474
01:06:38,138 --> 01:06:41,267
The Virginian saw the horses must have
been hard to drive in,

1475
01:06:41,267 --> 01:06:45,537
especially after Balaam brought them the
wild sorrel as a leader.

1476
01:06:45,537 --> 01:06:49,170
“If you’d kep’ ridin’ him,
’stead of changin’ off on your hawss,

1477
01:06:49,170 --> 01:06:51,716
they’d have behaved quieter,”
said the foreman.

1478
01:06:51,716 --> 01:06:55,910
“That’s good seasonable
advice,” said Balaam, sarcastically.

1479
01:06:55,910 --> -1:59:59,000
“I could have told you that now.

1480
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

1481
01:06:57,600 --> 01:07:01,212
“I could have told you when you started,”
said the Virginian, heating

1482
01:07:01,212 --> 01:07:02,772
the coffee for Balaam.

1483
01:07:02,772 --> 01:07:07,243
Balaam was eloquent on the outrageous
conduct of the horses.

1484
01:07:07,243 --> 01:07:11,526
He had come up with them evidently
striking back for Butte Creek,

1485
01:07:11,526 --> 01:07:13,993
with the old mare in the lead.

1486
01:07:13,993 --> 01:07:19,328
“But I soon showed her the road she was
to go,” he said, as he drove them

1487
01:07:19,328 --> 01:07:20,276
now to the water.

1488
01:07:20,276 --> 01:07:25,531
The Virginian noticed the slight limp of
the mare, and how her pastern was cut as

1489
01:07:25,531 --> 01:07:28,415
if with a stone or the sharp
heel of a boot.

1490
01:07:28,415 --> 01:07:31,610
“I guess she’ll not be in a hurry to
travel except when she’s

1491
01:07:31,610 --> 01:07:33,677
wanted to,” continued Balaam.

1492
01:07:33,677 --> 01:07:37,061
He sat down, and sullenly
poured himself some coffee.

1493
01:07:37,061 --> 01:07:40,349
“We’ll be in luck if we make any
Sunk Creek this night.”

1494
01:07:40,349 --> 01:07:43,621
He went on with his breakfast,
thinking aloud for the benefit of his

1495
01:07:43,621 --> 01:07:48,805
companion, who made no comments,
preferring silence to the discomfort of

1496
01:07:48,805 --> 01:07:54,038
talking with a man whose vindictive
humor was so thoroughly uppermost.

1497
01:07:54,038 --> 01:07:58,360
He did not even listen very attentively,
but continued his preparations for

1498
01:07:58,360 --> 01:08:02,922
departure, washing the dishes,
rolling the blankets,

1499
01:08:02,922 --> 01:08:07,435
and moving about in his usual way of
easy and visible good nature.

1500
01:08:07,435 --> 01:08:13,134
“Six o’clock, already,”
said Balaam, saddling the horses.

1501
01:08:13,134 --> 01:08:16,072
“And we’ll not get started
for ten minutes more.”

1502
01:08:16,072 --> 01:08:18,211
Then he came to Pedro.

1503
01:08:18,211 --> 01:08:21,014
“So you haven’t quit fooling
yet, haven’t you?”

1504
01:08:21,014 --> 01:08:24,779
he exclaimed, for the pony shrank as
he lifted the bridle.

1505
01:08:24,779 --> 01:08:26,884
“Take that for your sore mouth!”

1506
01:08:26,884 --> 01:08:30,941
and he rammed the bit in,
at which Pedro flung back and reared.

1507
01:08:30,941 --> 01:08:35,186
“Well, I never saw Pedro act that way
yet,” said the Virginian.

1508
01:08:35,186 --> 01:08:36,918
“Ah, rubbish!”

1509
01:08:36,918 --> 01:08:37,676
said Balaam.

1510
01:08:37,676 --> 01:08:39,229
“They’re all the same.

1511
01:08:39,229 --> 01:08:42,328
Not a bastard one but’s laying for his
chance to do for you.

1512
01:08:42,328 --> 01:08:45,059
Some’ll buck you off,
and some’ll roll with you,

1513
01:08:45,059 --> 01:08:47,607
and some’ll fight you
with their fore feet.

1514
01:08:47,607 --> 01:08:51,986
They may play good for a year,
but the Western pony’s man’s enemy,

1515
01:08:51,986 --> 01:08:55,124
and when he judges he’s got his chance,
he’s going to do his best.

1516
01:08:55,124 --> 01:08:57,884
And if you come out alive it
won’t be his fault.”

1517
01:08:57,884 --> 01:09:00,987
Balaam paused for a while, packing.

1518
01:09:00,987 --> 01:09:05,027
“You’ve got to keep them afraid of you,”
he said next; “that’s what you’ve got to

1519
01:09:05,027 --> 01:09:07,364
do if you don’t want trouble.

1520
01:09:07,364 --> 01:09:12,601
That Pedro horse there has been fed,
hand-fed, and fooled with like a damn

1521
01:09:12,601 --> 01:09:14,777
pet, and what’s that policy done?

1522
01:09:14,777 --> 01:09:19,349
Why, he goes ugly when he thinks it’s
time, and decides he’ll not drive any

1523
01:09:19,349 --> 01:09:21,213
horses into camp this morning.

1524
01:09:21,213 --> 01:09:23,351
He knows better now.”

1525
01:09:23,351 --> 01:09:24,549
“Mr.

1526
01:09:24,549 --> 01:09:29,324
Balaam,” said the Virginian,
“I’ll buy that hawss off yu’ right now.”

1527
01:09:29,324 --> 01:09:30,707
Balaam shook his head.

1528
01:09:30,707 --> 01:09:34,124
“You’ll not do that right now or any
other time,” said he.

1529
01:09:34,124 --> 01:09:35,572
“I happen to want him.”

1530
01:09:35,572 --> 01:09:37,505
The Virginian could do no more.

1531
01:09:37,505 --> 01:09:43,510
He had heard cowpunchers say to
refractory ponies, “You keep still,

1532
01:09:43,510 --> 01:09:44,868
or I’ll Balaam you!”

1533
01:09:44,868 --> 01:09:48,003
and he now understood the
aptness of the expression.

1534
01:09:48,003 --> 01:09:54,002
Meanwhile Balaam began to lead Pedro to
the creek for a last drink before

1535
01:09:54,002 --> 01:09:56,302
starting across the torrid drought.

1536
01:09:56,302 --> 01:09:59,902
The horse held back on the rein a little,
and Balaam turned and cut the

1537
01:09:59,902 --> 01:10:01,796
whip across his forehead.

1538
01:10:01,796 --> 01:10:06,507
A delay of forcing and backing followed,
while the Virginian,

1539
01:10:06,507 --> 01:10:08,685
already in the saddle, waited.

1540
01:10:08,685 --> 01:10:13,286
The minutes passed, and no immediate
prospect, apparently,

1541
01:10:13,286 --> 01:10:14,844
of getting nearer Sunk Creek.

1542
01:10:14,844 --> 01:10:17,324
“He ain’ goin’ to follow you while you’re
beatin’ his haid,” the

1543
01:10:17,324 --> 01:10:18,737
Southerner at length remarked.

1544
01:10:18,737 --> 01:10:22,519
“Do you think you can teach
me anything about horses?”

1545
01:10:22,519 --> 01:10:23,753
retorted Balaam.

1546
01:10:23,753 --> 01:10:27,701
“Well, it don’t look like I could,”
said the Virginian, lazily.

1547
01:10:27,701 --> 01:10:31,238
“Then don’t try it, so long as it’s not
your horse, my friend.”

1548
01:10:31,238 --> 01:10:34,439
Again the Southerner levelled
his eye on Balaam.

1549
01:10:34,439 --> 01:10:38,001
“All right,” he said,
in the same gentle voice.

1550
01:10:38,001 --> 01:10:40,592
“And don’t you call me your friend.

1551
01:10:40,592 --> 01:10:42,830
You’ve made that mistake twiced.”

1552
01:10:42,830 --> 01:10:46,547
The road was shadeless,
as it had been from the start,

1553
01:10:46,547 --> 01:10:48,604
and they could not travel fast.

1554
01:10:48,604 --> 01:10:53,484
During the first few hours all coolness
was driven out of the glassy morning,

1555
01:10:53,484 --> 01:10:58,977
and another day of illimitable sun
invested the world with its blaze.

1556
01:10:58,977 --> 01:11:04,565
The pale Bow Leg Range was coming nearer,
but its hard hot slants and rifts

1557
01:11:04,565 --> 01:11:09,100
suggested no sort of freshness,
and even the pines that spread for wide

1558
01:11:09,100 --> 01:11:14,387
miles along near the summit counted for
nothing in the distance and the glare,

1559
01:11:14,387 --> 01:11:19,797
but seemed mere patches
of dull dry discoloration.

1560
01:11:19,797 --> 01:11:23,555
No talk was exchanged between the two
travellers, for the cowpuncher had

1561
01:11:23,555 --> 01:11:27,885
nothing to say and Balaam was sulky,
so they moved along in silent endurance

1562
01:11:27,885 --> 01:11:31,135
of each other’s company and the
tedium of the journey.

1563
01:11:31,135 --> 01:11:36,134
But the slow succession of rise and fall
in the plain changed and shortened.

1564
01:11:36,134 --> 01:11:41,696
The earth’s surface became lumpy,
rising into mounds and knotted systems

1565
01:11:41,696 --> 01:11:47,566
of steep small hills cut apart by
staring gashes of sand,

1566
01:11:47,566 --> 01:11:51,545
where water poured in the spring
from the melting snow.

1567
01:11:51,545 --> 01:11:57,399
After a time they ascended through the
foothills till the plain below was for a

1568
01:11:57,399 --> 01:12:01,831
while concealed, but came again into
view in its entirety,

1569
01:12:01,831 --> 01:12:07,857
distant and a thing of the past,
while some magpies sailed down to meet

1570
01:12:07,857 --> 01:12:18,183
them from the new country
they were entering.

1571
01:12:18,183 --> 01:12:22,952
They passed up through a small
transparent forest of dead trees

1572
01:12:22,952 --> 01:12:27,446
standing stark and white,
and a little higher came on a line of

1573
01:12:27,446 --> 01:12:31,506
narrow moisture that crossed the way and
formed a stale pool among

1574
01:12:31,506 --> 01:12:32,898
some willow thickets.

1575
01:12:32,898 --> 01:12:38,289
They turned aside to water their horses,
and found near the pool a circular spot

1576
01:12:38,289 --> 01:12:44,486
of ashes and some poles lying,
and beside these a cage-like edifice of

1577
01:12:44,486 --> 01:12:46,987
willow wands built in the ground.

1578
01:12:46,987 --> 01:12:50,163
“Indian camp,” observed the Virginian.

1579
01:12:50,163 --> 01:12:54,398
There were the tracks of five or six
horses on the farther side of the pool,

1580
01:12:54,398 --> 01:12:58,840
and they did not come into the trail,
but led off among the rocks on some

1581
01:12:58,840 --> 01:13:00,070
system of their own.

1582
01:13:00,070 --> 01:13:02,433
“They’re about a week old,” said Balaam.

1583
01:13:02,433 --> 01:13:04,760
“It’s part of that outfit
that’s been hunting.”

1584
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:08,656
“They’ve gone on to visit their
friends,” added the cowpuncher.

1585
01:13:08,656 --> 01:13:11,579
“Yes, on the Southern Reservation.

1586
01:13:11,579 --> 01:13:15,132
How far do you call Sunk Creek now?”

1587
01:13:15,132 --> 01:13:19,190
“Well,” said the Virginian,
calculating, “it’s mighty nigh fo’ty

1588
01:13:19,190 --> 01:13:23,312
miles from Muddy Crossin’, an’ I
reckon we’ve come eighteen.”

1589
01:13:23,312 --> 01:13:23,994
“Just about.

1590
01:13:23,994 --> 01:13:25,272
It’s noon.”

1591
01:13:25,272 --> 01:13:27,575
Balaam snapped his watch shut.

1592
01:13:27,575 --> 01:13:30,047
“We’ll rest here till 12:30.”

1593
01:13:30,047 --> 01:13:32,657
When it was time to go,
the Virginian looked

1594
01:13:32,657 --> 01:13:34,777
musingly at the mountains.

1595
01:13:34,777 --> 01:13:38,803
“We’ll need to travel right smart to get
through the canyon tonight,” he said.

1596
01:13:38,803 --> 01:13:42,228
“Tell you what,” said Balaam;
“we’ll rope the Judge’s horses together

1597
01:13:42,228 --> 01:13:43,729
and drive ’em in front of us.

1598
01:13:43,729 --> 01:13:45,051
That’ll make speed.”

1599
01:13:45,051 --> 01:13:46,930
“Mightn’t they get away on us?”

1600
01:13:46,930 --> 01:13:48,228
objected the Virginian.

1601
01:13:48,228 --> 01:13:49,835
“They’re pow’ful wild.”

1602
01:13:49,835 --> 01:13:53,056
“They can’t get away from me,
I guess,” said Balaam,

1603
01:13:53,056 --> 01:13:54,722
and the arrangement was adopted.

1604
01:13:54,722 --> 01:13:58,547
“We’re the first this season over this
piece of the trail,”

1605
01:13:58,547 --> 01:14:00,369
he observed presently.

1606
01:14:00,369 --> 01:14:04,277
His companion had noticed the
ground already, and assented.

1607
01:14:04,277 --> 01:14:08,733
There were no tracks anywhere to be seen
over which winter had not come and gone

1608
01:14:08,733 --> 01:14:10,221
since they had been made.

1609
01:14:10,221 --> 01:14:16,601
Presently the trail wound into a sultry
gulch that hemmed in the heat and seemed

1610
01:14:16,601 --> 01:14:20,619
to draw down the sun’s
rays more vertically.

1611
01:14:20,619 --> 01:14:25,033
The sorrel horse chose this place to make
a try for liberty.

1612
01:14:25,033 --> 01:14:28,835
He suddenly whirled from the trail,
dragging with him his

1613
01:14:28,835 --> 01:14:30,515
less inventive fellow.

1614
01:14:30,515 --> 01:14:34,478
Leaving the Virginian with the old mare,
Balaam headed them off,

1615
01:14:34,478 --> 01:14:37,775
for Pedro was quick,
and they came jumping down the bank

1616
01:14:37,775 --> 01:14:42,856
together, but swiftly crossed up on the
other side, getting much higher before

1617
01:14:42,856 --> 01:14:44,134
they could be reached.

1618
01:14:44,134 --> 01:14:49,990
It was no place for this sort of game,
as the sides of the ravine were ploughed

1619
01:14:49,990 --> 01:14:55,099
with steep channels,
broken with jutting knobs of rock,

1620
01:14:55,099 --> 01:15:01,177
and impeded by short twisted pines that
swung out from their roots horizontally

1621
01:15:01,177 --> 01:15:04,585
over the pitch of the hill.

1622
01:15:04,585 --> 01:15:08,698
The Virginian helped,
but used his horse with more judgment,

1623
01:15:08,698 --> 01:15:12,372
keeping as much on the level as
possible, and endeavoring to anticipate

1624
01:15:12,372 --> 01:15:17,718
the next turn of the runaways before
they made it, while Balaam attempted to

1625
01:15:17,718 --> 01:15:23,424
follow them close, wheeling short when
they doubled, heavily beating up the

1626
01:15:23,424 --> 01:15:28,836
face of the slope, veering again to come
down to the point he had left,

1627
01:15:28,836 --> 01:15:34,816
and whenever he felt Pedro begin to
flag, driving his spurs into the horse

1628
01:15:34,816 --> 01:15:36,833
and forcing him to keep up the pace.

1629
01:15:36,833 --> 01:15:41,883
He had set out to overtake and capture on
the side of the mountain these two

1630
01:15:41,883 --> 01:15:47,688
animals who had been running wild for
many weeks, and now carried no weight

1631
01:15:47,688 --> 01:15:53,455
but themselves, and the futility of such
work could not penetrate his

1632
01:15:53,455 --> 01:15:56,527
obstinate and rising temper.

1633
01:15:56,527 --> 01:16:00,527
He had made up his mind not to give in.

1634
01:16:00,527 --> 01:16:05,778
The Virginian soon decided to move slowly
along for the present,

1635
01:16:05,778 --> 01:16:10,214
preventing the wild horses from passing
down the gulch again,

1636
01:16:10,214 --> 01:16:14,681
but otherwise saving his own
animal from useless fatigue.

1637
01:16:14,681 --> 01:16:20,099
He saw that Pedro was reeking wet,
with mouth open, and constantly

1638
01:16:20,099 --> 01:16:22,403
stumbling, though he galloped on.

1639
01:16:22,403 --> 01:16:26,724
The cowpuncher kept the group in sight,
driving the packhorse in front of him,

1640
01:16:26,724 --> 01:16:31,563
and watching the tactics of the sorrel,
who had now undoubtedly become the

1641
01:16:31,563 --> 01:16:36,129
leader of the expedition,
and was at the top of the gulch,

1642
01:16:36,129 --> 01:16:41,007
in vain trying to find an outlet through
its rocky rim to the levels above.

1643
01:16:41,007 --> 01:16:45,238
He soon judged this to be no
thoroughfare, and changing his plan,

1644
01:16:45,238 --> 01:16:49,843
trotted down to the bottom and up the
other side, gaining more and more;

1645
01:16:49,843 --> 01:16:54,162
for in this new descent
Pedro had fallen twice.

1646
01:16:54,162 --> 01:16:58,674
Then the sorrel showed the cleverness of
a genuinely vicious horse.

1647
01:16:58,674 --> 01:17:03,770
The Virginian saw him stop and fall to
kicking his companion with all the

1648
01:17:03,770 --> 01:17:05,919
energy that a short rope would permit.

1649
01:17:05,919 --> 01:17:09,344
The rope slipped, and both,
unencumbered, reached

1650
01:17:09,344 --> 01:17:11,611
the top and disappeared.

1651
01:17:11,611 --> 01:17:15,804
Leaving the packhorse for Balaam,
the Virginian started after them and

1652
01:17:15,804 --> 01:17:19,368
came into a high tableland,
beyond which the mountains

1653
01:17:19,368 --> 01:17:20,798
began in earnest.

1654
01:17:20,798 --> 01:17:24,475
The runaways were moving across toward
these at an easy rate.

1655
01:17:24,475 --> 01:17:28,863
He followed for a moment,
then looking back, and seeing no sign of

1656
01:17:28,863 --> 01:17:34,804
Balaam, waited, for the horses were sure
not to go fast when they reached

1657
01:17:34,804 --> 01:17:37,111
good pasture or water.

1658
01:17:37,111 --> 01:17:42,142
He got out of the saddle and sat on the
ground, watching, till the mare came up

1659
01:17:42,142 --> 01:17:45,064
slowly into sight, and Balaam behind
her.

1660
01:17:45,064 --> 01:17:51,199
When they were near, Balaam dismounted
and struck Pedro fearfully,

1661
01:17:51,199 --> 01:17:54,691
until the stick broke,
and he raised the splintered

1662
01:17:54,691 --> 01:17:56,647
half to continue.

1663
01:17:56,647 --> 01:18:00,849
Seeing the pony’s condition,
the Virginian spoke,

1664
01:18:00,849 --> 01:18:03,729
and said, “I’d let that hawss alone.”

1665
01:18:03,729 --> 01:18:07,609
Balaam turned to him,
but wholly possessed by passion did not

1666
01:18:07,609 --> 01:18:12,830
seem to hear, and the Southerner noticed
how white and like that of a

1667
01:18:12,830 --> 01:18:15,379
maniac his face was.

1668
01:18:15,379 --> 01:18:17,672
The stick slid to the ground.

1669
01:18:17,672 --> 01:18:21,395
“He played he was tired,”
said Balaam, looking at the

1670
01:18:21,395 --> 01:18:23,420
Virginian with glazed eyes.

1671
01:18:23,420 --> 01:18:29,087
The violence of his rage affected him
physically, like some stroke of illness.

1672
01:18:29,087 --> 01:18:31,107
“He played out on me on purpose.”

1673
01:18:31,107 --> 01:18:34,342
The man’s voice was dry and light.

1674
01:18:34,342 --> 01:18:38,072
“He’s perfectly fresh now,”
he continued, and turned again to the

1675
01:18:38,072 --> 01:18:42,556
coughing, swaying horse,
whose eyes were closed.

1676
01:18:42,556 --> 01:18:46,127
Not having the stick,
he seized the animal’s unresisting

1677
01:18:46,127 --> 01:18:47,988
head and shook it.

1678
01:18:47,988 --> 01:18:52,612
The Virginian watched him a moment,
and rose to stop such a spectacle.

1679
01:18:52,612 --> 01:18:58,724
Then, as if conscious he was doing no
real hurt, Balaam ceased,

1680
01:18:58,724 --> 01:19:03,179
and turning again in slow fashion looked
across the level, where the

1681
01:19:03,179 --> 01:19:05,059
runaways were still visible.

1682
01:19:05,059 --> 01:19:09,536
“I’ll have to take your horse,”
he said, “mine’s played out on me.”

1683
01:19:09,536 --> 01:19:11,903
“You ain’ goin’ to touch my hawss.”

1684
01:19:11,903 --> 01:19:16,247
Again the words seemed not entirely to
reach Balaam’s understanding,

1685
01:19:16,247 --> 01:19:19,600
so dulled by rage were his senses.

1686
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:23,645
He made no answer, but mounted Pedro;
and the failing pony walked mechanically

1687
01:19:23,645 --> 01:19:27,858
forward, while the Virginian,
puzzled, stood looking after him.

1688
01:19:27,858 --> 01:19:32,872
Balaam seemed without purpose of going
anywhere, and stopped in a moment.

1689
01:19:32,872 --> 01:19:35,611
Suddenly he was at work at something.

1690
01:19:35,611 --> 01:19:39,610
This sight was odd and new to look at.

1691
01:19:39,610 --> 01:19:45,463
For a few seconds it had no meaning to
the Virginian as he watched.

1692
01:19:45,463 --> 01:19:48,123
Then his mind grasped
the horror, too late.

1693
01:19:48,123 --> 01:19:51,987
Even with his cry of execration and the
tiger spring that he gave to stop

1694
01:19:51,987 --> 01:19:54,060
Balaam, the monstrosity was wrought.

1695
01:19:54,060 --> 01:19:58,102
Pedro sank motionless,
his head rolling flat on the earth.

1696
01:19:58,102 --> 01:20:00,568
Balaam was jammed beneath him.

1697
01:20:00,568 --> 01:20:04,609
The man had struggled to his feet before
the Virginian reached the spot,

1698
01:20:04,609 --> 01:20:10,165
and the horse then lifted his head and
turned it piteously round.

1699
01:20:10,165 --> 01:20:15,185
Then vengeance like a blast struck Balaam.

1700
01:20:15,185 --> 01:20:19,756
The Virginian hurled him to the ground,
lifted and hurled him again,

1701
01:20:19,756 --> 01:20:23,410
lifted him and beat his face
and struck his jaw.

1702
01:20:23,410 --> 01:20:29,078
The man’s strong ox-like
fighting availed nothing.

1703
01:20:29,078 --> 01:20:33,798
He fended his eyes as best he could
against these sledgehammer

1704
01:20:33,798 --> 01:20:35,990
blows of justice.

1705
01:20:35,990 --> 01:20:39,113
He felt blindly for his pistol.

1706
01:20:39,113 --> 01:20:45,748
That arm was caught and wrenched
backward, and crushed and doubled.

1707
01:20:45,748 --> 01:20:49,852
He seemed to hear his own bones,
and set up a hideous screaming

1708
01:20:49,852 --> 01:20:51,171
of hate and pain.

1709
01:20:51,171 --> 01:20:56,452
Then the pistol at last came out,
and together with the hand that grasped

1710
01:20:56,452 --> 01:20:59,604
it was instantly stamped into the dust.

1711
01:20:59,604 --> 01:21:04,205
Once again the creature was lifted and
slung so that he lay across Pedro’s

1712
01:21:04,205 --> 01:21:07,916
saddle a blurred, dingy, wet pulp.

1713
01:21:07,916 --> 01:21:10,463
Vengeance had come and gone.

1714
01:21:10,463 --> 01:21:13,162
The man and the horse were motionless.

1715
01:21:13,162 --> 01:21:16,719
Around them, silence seemed to
gather like a witness.

1716
01:21:16,719 --> 01:21:20,810
“If you are dead,” said the Virginian,
“I am glad of it.”

1717
01:21:20,810 --> 01:21:24,103
He stood looking down at Balaam and
Pedro, prone in the middle

1718
01:21:24,103 --> 01:21:25,278
of the open tableland.

1719
01:21:25,278 --> 01:21:28,172
Then he saw Balaam looking at him.

1720
01:21:28,172 --> 01:21:34,719
It was the quiet stare of sight without
thought or feeling, the mere visual

1721
01:21:34,719 --> 01:21:39,676
sense alone, almost frightful in its
separation from any self.

1722
01:21:39,676 --> 01:21:43,408
But as he watched those eyes,
the self came back into them.

1723
01:21:43,408 --> 01:21:46,072
“I have not killed you,”
said the Virginian.

1724
01:21:46,072 --> -1:59:59,000
“Well, I ain’t goin’ to do any more to
yu’⁠—if that’s a satisfaction to know.

1725
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

1726
01:21:49,768 --> 01:21:54,568
Then he began to attend to Balaam with
impersonal skill, like someone

1727
01:21:54,568 --> 01:21:56,268
hired for the purpose.

1728
01:21:56,268 --> 01:22:00,962
“He ain’t hurt bad,” he asserted aloud,
as if the man were some nameless

1729
01:22:00,962 --> 01:22:04,991
patient; and then to Balaam he remarked,
“I reckon it might have put a less tough

1730
01:22:04,991 --> 01:22:07,911
man than you out of business
for quite a while.

1731
01:22:07,911 --> 01:22:10,020
I’m goin’ to get some water now.”

1732
01:22:10,020 --> 01:22:14,442
When he returned with the water,
Balaam was sitting up, looking about

1733
01:22:14,442 --> 01:22:14,682
him.

1734
01:22:14,682 --> 01:22:18,300
He had not yet spoken,
nor did he now speak.

1735
01:22:18,300 --> 01:22:21,922
The sunlight flashed on the six-shooter
where it lay, and the

1736
01:22:21,922 --> 01:22:23,689
Virginian secured it.

1737
01:22:23,689 --> 01:22:29,193
“She ain’t so pretty as she was,”
he remarked, as he examined the weapon.

1738
01:22:29,193 --> 01:22:30,799
“But she’ll go right handy yet.”

1739
01:22:30,799 --> 01:22:33,398
Strength was in a measure
returning to Pedro.

1740
01:22:33,398 --> 01:22:36,939
He was a young horse,
and the exhaustion neither of anguish

1741
01:22:36,939 --> 01:22:41,644
nor of overriding was enough to affect
him long or seriously.

1742
01:22:41,644 --> 01:22:46,057
He got himself on his feet and walked
waveringly over to the old mare,

1743
01:22:46,057 --> 01:22:47,784
and stood by her for comfort.

1744
01:22:47,784 --> 01:22:53,217
The cowpuncher came up to him,
and Pedro, after starting back slightly,

1745
01:22:53,217 --> 01:22:57,647
seemed to comprehend that he
was in friendly hands.

1746
01:22:57,647 --> 01:23:02,129
It was plain that he would soon be able
to travel slowly if no weight was on

1747
01:23:02,129 --> 01:23:04,704
him, and that he would be a
very good horse again.

1748
01:23:04,704 --> 01:23:08,567
Whether they abandoned the runaways or
not, there was no staying here for night

1749
01:23:08,567 --> 01:23:11,140
to overtake them without food or water.

1750
01:23:11,140 --> 01:23:14,767
The day was still high,
and what its next few hours had in store

1751
01:23:14,767 --> 01:23:17,727
the Virginian could not say,
and he left them to take care of

1752
01:23:17,727 --> 01:23:22,842
themselves, determining meanwhile that
he would take command of the minutes and

1753
01:23:22,842 --> 01:23:28,069
maintain the position he had assumed
both as to Balaam and Pedro.

1754
01:23:28,069 --> 01:23:31,709
He took Pedro’s saddle off,
threw the mare’s pack to the ground,

1755
01:23:31,709 --> 01:23:36,067
put Balaam’s saddle on her,
and on that stowed or tied her original

1756
01:23:36,067 --> 01:23:40,406
pack, which he could do,
since it was so light.

1757
01:23:40,406 --> 01:23:43,031
Then he went to Balaam,
who was sitting up.

1758
01:23:43,031 --> 01:23:45,340
“I reckon you can travel,”
said the Virginian.

1759
01:23:45,340 --> 01:23:47,350
“And your hawss can.

1760
01:23:47,350 --> 01:23:50,072
If you’re comin’ with me,
you’ll ride your mare.

1761
01:23:50,072 --> -1:59:59,000
I’m goin’ to trail them hawsses

1762
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
.

1763
01:23:51,956 --> 01:23:55,113
If you’re not comin’ with me,
your hawss comes with me,

1764
01:23:55,113 --> 01:23:57,233
and you’ll take fifty dollars for him.”

1765
01:23:57,233 --> 01:24:00,600
Balaam was indifferent
to this good bargain.

1766
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:05,087
He did not look at the other or speak,
but rose and searched about

1767
01:24:05,087 --> 01:24:06,240
him on the ground.

1768
01:24:06,240 --> 01:24:12,432
The Virginian was also indifferent as to
whether Balaam chose to answer or not.

1769
01:24:12,432 --> 01:24:16,713
Seeing Balaam searching the ground,
he finished what he had to say.

1770
01:24:16,713 --> 01:24:19,032
“I have your six-shooter,
and you’ll have it when I’m

1771
01:24:19,032 --> 01:24:20,158
ready for you to.

1772
01:24:20,158 --> 01:24:22,232
Now, I’m goin’,” he concluded.

1773
01:24:22,232 --> 01:24:26,673
Balaam’s intellect was clear enough now,
and he saw that though the rest of this

1774
01:24:26,673 --> 01:24:30,764
journey would be nearly intolerable,
it must go on.

1775
01:24:30,764 --> 01:24:34,521
He looked at the impassive cowpuncher
getting ready to go and tying a rope on

1776
01:24:34,521 --> 01:24:37,285
Pedro’s neck to lead him,
then he looked at the mountains where

1777
01:24:37,285 --> 01:24:41,523
the runaways had vanished,
and it did not seem credible to him that

1778
01:24:41,523 --> 01:24:43,521
he had come into such straits.

1779
01:24:43,521 --> 01:24:48,254
He was helped stiffly on the mare,
and the three horses in single file took

1780
01:24:48,254 --> 01:24:51,820
up their journey once more,
and came slowly among the mountains.

1781
01:24:51,820 --> 01:24:56,792
The perpetual desert was ended,
and they crossed a small brook,

1782
01:24:56,792 --> 01:24:58,519
where they missed the trail.

1783
01:24:58,519 --> 01:25:02,229
The Virginian dismounted to find where
the horses had turned off,

1784
01:25:02,229 --> 01:25:06,237
and discovered that they had gone
straight up the ridge by the

1785
01:25:06,237 --> 01:25:07,479
watercourse.

1786
01:25:07,479 --> 01:25:12,982
“There’s been a man camped in hyeh inside
a month,” he said, kicking up a

1787
01:25:12,982 --> 01:25:14,431
rag of red flannel.

1788
01:25:14,431 --> 01:25:17,633
“White man and two hawsses.

1789
01:25:17,633 --> 01:25:20,499
Ours have went up his old tracks.”

1790
01:25:20,499 --> 01:25:24,305
It was not easy for Balaam to speak yet,
and he kept his silence.

1791
01:25:24,305 --> 01:25:29,192
But he remembered that Shorty had spoken
of a trapper who had

1792
01:25:29,192 --> 01:25:31,174
started for Sunk Creek.

1793
01:25:31,174 --> 01:25:35,528
For three hours they followed the
runaways’ course over softer ground,

1794
01:25:35,528 --> 01:25:38,404
and steadily ascending,
passed one or two springs,

1795
01:25:38,404 --> 01:25:43,010
at length, where the mud was not yet
settled in the hoofprints.

1796
01:25:43,010 --> 01:25:47,111
Then they came through a corner of pine
forest and down a sudden bank among

1797
01:25:47,111 --> 01:25:49,275
quaking-asps to a green park.

1798
01:25:49,275 --> 01:25:53,791
Here the runaways beside a stream were
grazing at ease, but saw them coming,

1799
01:25:53,791 --> 01:25:56,492
and started on again,
following down the stream.

1800
01:25:56,492 --> 01:26:00,523
For the present all to be done was to
keep them in sight.

1801
01:26:00,523 --> 01:26:05,555
This creek received tributaries and
widened, making a valley for itself.

1802
01:26:05,555 --> 01:26:09,779
Above the bottom, lining the first
terrace of the ridge,

1803
01:26:09,779 --> 01:26:15,281
began the pines, and stretched back,
unbroken over intervening summit and

1804
01:26:15,281 --> 01:26:19,372
basin, to cease at last where
the higher peaks presided.

1805
01:26:19,372 --> 01:26:23,125
“This hyeh’s the middle fork of Sunk
Creek,” said the Virginian.

1806
01:26:23,125 --> 01:26:25,561
“We’ll get on to our right road
again where they join.”

1807
01:26:25,561 --> 01:26:28,165
Soon a game trail marked
itself along the stream.

1808
01:26:28,165 --> 01:26:31,225
If this would only continue,
the runaways would be nearly sure to

1809
01:26:31,225 --> 01:26:32,945
follow it down into the canyon.

1810
01:26:32,945 --> 01:26:37,506
Then there would be no way for them but
to go on and come out into their own

1811
01:26:37,506 --> 01:26:41,445
country, where they would make for the
Judge’s ranch of their own accord.

1812
01:26:41,445 --> 01:26:45,388
The great point was to reach
the canyon before dark.

1813
01:26:45,388 --> 01:26:48,770
They passed into permanent shadow;
for though the other side of the creek

1814
01:26:48,770 --> 01:26:53,007
shone in full day, the sun had departed
behind the ridges immediately above

1815
01:26:53,007 --> 01:26:53,367
them.

1816
01:26:53,367 --> 01:26:57,300
Coolness filled the air,
and the silence, which in this deep

1817
01:26:57,300 --> 01:27:03,093
valley of invading shadow seemed too
silent, was relieved by the birds.

1818
01:27:03,093 --> 01:27:08,888
Not birds of song, but a freakish band of
gray talkative observers,

1819
01:27:08,888 --> 01:27:13,640
who came calling and croaking along
through the pines, and inspected the

1820
01:27:13,640 --> 01:27:17,933
cavalcade, keeping it company for a
while, and then flying up

1821
01:27:17,933 --> 01:27:19,136
into the woods again.

1822
01:27:19,136 --> 01:27:22,304
The travellers came round a corner on a
little spread of marsh,

1823
01:27:22,304 --> 01:27:27,384
and from somewhere in the middle of it
rose a buzzard and sailed on its black

1824
01:27:27,384 --> 01:27:31,479
pinions into the air above them,
wheeling and wheeling,

1825
01:27:31,479 --> 01:27:32,825
but did not grow distant.

1826
01:27:32,825 --> 01:27:36,308
As it swept over the trail,
something fell from its claw,

1827
01:27:36,308 --> 01:27:40,290
a rag of red flannel;
and each man in turn looked at it as

1828
01:27:40,290 --> 01:27:41,668
his horse went by.

1829
01:27:41,668 --> 01:27:44,594
“I wonder if there’s plenty
elk and deer hyeh?”

1830
01:27:44,594 --> 01:27:45,753
said the Virginian.

1831
01:27:45,753 --> 01:27:49,410
“I guess there is,” Balaam
replied, speaking at last.

1832
01:27:49,410 --> 01:27:54,028
The travellers had become
strangely reconciled.

1833
01:27:54,028 --> 01:27:58,884
“There’s game ’most all over these
mountains,” the Virginian continued;

1834
01:27:58,884 --> 01:28:01,196
“country not been settled long enough
to scare them out.”

1835
01:28:01,196 --> 01:28:04,421
So they fell into casual conversation,
and for the first time were glad

1836
01:28:04,421 --> 01:28:06,071
of each other’s company.

1837
01:28:06,071 --> 01:28:11,635
The sound of a new bird came from the
pines above⁠—the hoot of an owl⁠—and was

1838
01:28:11,635 --> 01:28:13,875
answered from some other
part of the wood.

1839
01:28:13,875 --> 01:28:20,279
This they did not particularly notice at
first, but soon they heard the same

1840
01:28:20,279 --> 01:28:24,382
note, unexpectedly distant, like an
echo.

1841
01:28:24,382 --> 01:28:30,744
The game trail, now quite a defined path
beside the river, showed no sign of

1842
01:28:30,744 --> 01:28:36,279
changing its course or fading out into
blank ground, as these uncertain

1843
01:28:36,279 --> 01:28:38,941
guides do so often.

1844
01:28:38,941 --> 01:28:43,323
It led consistently in the desired
direction, and the two men were relieved

1845
01:28:43,323 --> 01:28:44,565
to see it continue.

1846
01:28:44,565 --> 01:28:48,243
Not only were the runaways easier to keep
track of, but better speed was

1847
01:28:48,243 --> 01:28:49,719
made along this valley.

1848
01:28:49,719 --> 01:28:55,163
The pervading imminence of night more and
more dispelled the lingering afternoon,

1849
01:28:55,163 --> 01:29:00,035
though there was yet no twilight in the
open, and the high peaks opposite shone

1850
01:29:00,035 --> 01:29:03,177
yellow in the invisible sun.

1851
01:29:03,177 --> 01:29:05,390
But now the owls hooted again.

1852
01:29:05,390 --> 01:29:09,547
Their music had something in it that
caused both the Virginian and Balaam to

1853
01:29:09,547 --> 01:29:13,624
look up at the pines and wish that
this valley would end.

1854
01:29:13,624 --> 01:29:18,443
Perhaps it was early for night-birds to
begin; or perhaps it was that the sound

1855
01:29:18,443 --> 01:29:22,320
never seemed to fall behind,
but moved abreast of them among the

1856
01:29:22,320 --> 01:29:28,389
trees above, as they rode on without
pause down below; some influence made

1857
01:29:28,389 --> 01:29:30,869
the faces of the travellers grave.

1858
01:29:30,869 --> 01:29:34,729
The spell of evil which the sight of the
wheeling buzzard had begun,

1859
01:29:34,729 --> 01:29:38,649
deepened as evening grew,
while ever and again along the creek the

1860
01:29:38,649 --> 01:29:44,222
singular call and answer of the owls
wandered among the darkness of the

1861
01:29:44,222 --> 01:29:46,536
trees not far away.

1862
01:29:46,536 --> 01:29:51,314
The sun was gone from the peaks when at
length the other side of the stream

1863
01:29:51,314 --> 01:29:53,911
opened into a long wide meadow.

1864
01:29:53,911 --> 01:29:57,449
The trail they followed,
after crossing a flat willow thicket by

1865
01:29:57,449 --> 01:30:03,107
the water, ran into dense pines,
that here for the first time reached all

1866
01:30:03,107 --> 01:30:05,342
the way down to the water’s edge.

1867
01:30:05,342 --> 01:30:09,298
The two men came out of the willows,
and saw ahead the capricious runaways

1868
01:30:09,298 --> 01:30:13,390
leave the bottom and go up the hill
and enter the wood.

1869
01:30:13,390 --> 01:30:16,252
“We must hinder that,”
said the Virginian; and

1870
01:30:16,252 --> 01:30:17,979
he dropped Pedro’s rope.

1871
01:30:17,979 --> 01:30:19,492
“There’s your six-shooter.

1872
01:30:19,492 --> 01:30:23,692
You keep the trail, and camp down there”
⁠—he pointed to where the trees came to

1873
01:30:23,692 --> 01:30:26,375
the water⁠—“till I head them hawsses
off.

1874
01:30:26,375 --> 01:30:28,253
I may not get back right away.”

1875
01:30:28,253 --> 01:30:33,015
He galloped up the open hill and went
into the pine, choosing a place above

1876
01:30:33,015 --> 01:30:34,643
where the vagrants had disappeared.

1877
01:30:34,643 --> 01:30:39,015
Balaam dismounted, and picking up his
six-shooter, took the rope off Pedro’s

1878
01:30:39,015 --> 01:30:42,915
neck and drove him slowly down toward
where the wood began.

1879
01:30:42,915 --> 01:30:47,495
Its interior was already dim,
and Balaam saw that here must be their

1880
01:30:47,495 --> 01:30:51,873
stopping-place tonight,
since there was no telling how wide this

1881
01:30:51,873 --> 01:30:57,409
pine strip might extend along the trail
before they could come out of it and

1882
01:30:57,409 --> 01:30:59,636
reach another suitable camping-ground.

1883
01:30:59,636 --> 01:31:04,805
Pedro had recovered his strength,
and he now showed signs of restlessness.

1884
01:31:04,805 --> 01:31:08,258
He shied where there was not even a stone
in the trail, and finally

1885
01:31:08,258 --> 01:31:09,652
turned sharply round.

1886
01:31:09,652 --> 01:31:13,310
Balaam expected he was going to rush back
on the way they had come;

1887
01:31:13,310 --> 01:31:16,293
but the horse stood still,
breathing excitedly.

1888
01:31:16,293 --> 01:31:19,961
He was urged forward again,
though he turned more than once.

1889
01:31:19,961 --> 01:31:24,253
But when they were a few paces from the
wood, and Balaam had got off preparatory

1890
01:31:24,253 --> 01:31:29,069
to camping, the horse snorted and dashed
into the water, and stood still there.

1891
01:31:29,069 --> 01:31:34,196
The astonished Balaam followed to turn
him; but Pedro seemed to lose control of

1892
01:31:34,196 --> 01:31:37,516
himself, and plunged to the middle of
the river, and was evidently

1893
01:31:37,516 --> 01:31:39,183
intending to cross.

1894
01:31:39,183 --> 01:31:43,599
Fearing that he would escape to the
opposite meadow and add to their

1895
01:31:43,599 --> 01:31:48,603
difficulties, Balaam,
with the idea of turning him round,

1896
01:31:48,603 --> 01:31:53,854
drew his six-shooter and fired in front
of the horse, divining,

1897
01:31:53,854 --> 01:31:58,802
even as the flash cut the dusk,
the secret of all this⁠—the

1898
01:31:58,802 --> 01:32:02,441
Indians; but too late.

1899
01:32:02,441 --> 01:32:07,282
His bruised hand had stiffened,
marring his aim, and he saw Pedro fall

1900
01:32:07,282 --> 01:32:12,087
over in the water then rise and struggle
up the bank on the farther shore,

1901
01:32:12,087 --> 01:32:14,715
where he now hurried also,
to find that he had broken

1902
01:32:14,715 --> 01:32:15,905
the pony’s leg.

1903
01:32:15,905 --> 01:32:20,638
He needed no interpreter for the voices
of the seeming owls that had haunted the

1904
01:32:20,638 --> 01:32:24,199
latter hour of their journey,
and he knew that his beast’s keener

1905
01:32:24,199 --> 01:32:29,122
instinct had perceived the destruction
that lurked in the interior of the wood.

1906
01:32:29,122 --> 01:32:32,918
The history of the trapper whose horse
had returned without him might have

1907
01:32:32,918 --> 01:32:35,233
been⁠—might still be⁠—his own;

1908
01:32:35,233 --> 01:32:40,288
and he thought of the rag that had fallen
from the buzzard’s talons when he had

1909
01:32:40,288 --> 01:32:42,652
been disturbed at his meal in the marsh.

1910
01:32:42,652 --> 01:32:47,441
“Peaceable” Indians were still in these
mountains, and some few of them had for

1911
01:32:47,441 --> 01:32:52,521
the past hour been skirting his journey
unseen, and now waited for him in the

1912
01:32:52,521 --> 01:32:55,394
wood which they expected him to enter.

1913
01:32:55,394 --> 01:32:59,496
They had been too wary to use their
rifles or show themselves,

1914
01:32:59,496 --> 01:33:03,951
lest these travellers should be only
part of a larger company following,

1915
01:33:03,951 --> 01:33:08,071
who would hear the noise of a shot,
and catch them in the act of murder.

1916
01:33:08,071 --> 01:33:14,006
So, safe under the cover of the pines,
they had planned to sling their silent

1917
01:33:14,006 --> 01:33:19,840
noose, and drag the white man from his
horse as he passed through the trees.

1918
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:24,174
Balaam looked over the river at the
ominous wood, and then he looked at

1919
01:33:24,174 --> 01:33:28,184
Pedro, the horse that he had first
maimed and now ruined,

1920
01:33:28,184 --> 01:33:30,465
to whom he probably owed his life.

1921
01:33:30,465 --> 01:33:34,711
He was lying on the ground,
quietly looking over the green meadow,

1922
01:33:34,711 --> 01:33:37,082
where dusk was gathering.

1923
01:33:37,082 --> 01:33:41,694
Perhaps he was not suffering from his
wound yet, as he rested on the ground;

1924
01:33:41,694 --> 01:33:47,498
and into his animal intelligence there
probably came no knowledge of this final

1925
01:33:47,498 --> 01:33:48,862
stroke of his fate.

1926
01:33:48,862 --> 01:33:54,585
At any rate, no sound of pain came from
Pedro, whose friendly and gentle face

1927
01:33:54,585 --> 01:33:57,545
remained turned toward the meadow.

1928
01:33:57,545 --> 01:34:02,437
Once more Balaam fired his pistol,
and this time the aim was true,

1929
01:34:02,437 --> 01:34:06,377
and the horse rolled over,
with a ball through his brain.

1930
01:34:06,377 --> 01:34:10,228
It was the best reward
that remained for him.

1931
01:34:10,228 --> 01:34:13,666
Then Balaam rejoined the old mare,
and turned from the middle

1932
01:34:13,666 --> 01:34:15,470
fork of Sunk Creek.

1933
01:34:15,470 --> 01:34:19,380
He dashed across the wide field,
and went over a ridge,

1934
01:34:19,380 --> 01:34:24,891
and found his way along in the night
till he came to the old trail⁠—the road

1935
01:34:24,891 --> 01:34:28,919
which they would never have left but for
him and his obstinacy.

1936
01:34:28,919 --> 01:34:33,916
He unsaddled the weary mare by Sunk
Creek, where the canyon begins,

1937
01:34:33,916 --> 01:34:38,038
letting her drag a rope and find pasture
and water, while he,

1938
01:34:38,038 --> 01:34:41,856
lighting no fire to betray him,
crouched close under a tree

1939
01:34:41,856 --> 01:34:43,807
till the light came.

1940
01:34:43,807 --> 01:34:46,146
He thought of the Virginian in the wood.

1941
01:34:46,146 --> 01:34:49,029
But what could either have done for the
other had he stayed to look for

1942
01:34:49,029 --> 01:34:50,550
him among the pines?

1943
01:34:50,550 --> 01:34:54,634
If the cowpuncher came back to the
corner, he would follow

1944
01:34:54,634 --> 01:34:57,029
Balaam’s tracks or not.

1945
01:34:57,029 --> 01:34:59,859
They would meet, at any rate,
where the creeks joined.

1946
01:34:59,859 --> 01:35:01,908
But they did not meet.

1947
01:35:01,908 --> 01:35:08,601
And then to Balaam the prospect of going
onward to the Sunk Creek Ranch became

1948
01:35:08,601 --> 01:35:10,072
more than he could bear.

1949
01:35:10,072 --> 01:35:13,541
To come without the horses,
to meet Judge Henry,

1950
01:35:13,541 --> 01:35:17,835
to meet the guests of the Judge’s,
looking as he did now after his

1951
01:35:17,835 --> 01:35:22,387
punishment by the Virginian,
to give the news about the Judge’s

1952
01:35:22,387 --> 01:35:27,821
favorite man⁠—no, how could he tell such
a story as this?

1953
01:35:27,821 --> 01:35:33,051
Balaam went no farther than a certain
cabin, where he slept,

1954
01:35:33,051 --> 01:35:34,955
and wrote a letter to the Judge.

1955
01:35:34,955 --> 01:35:38,525
This the owner of the cabin delivered.

1956
01:35:38,525 --> 01:35:44,233
And so, having spread news which would at
once cause a search for the Virginian,

1957
01:35:44,233 --> 01:35:50,558
and having constructed such sentences to
the Judge as would most smoothly explain

1958
01:35:50,558 --> 01:35:56,829
how, being overtaken by illness,
he had not wished to be a burden at Sunk

1959
01:35:56,829 --> 01:36:00,540
Creek, Balaam turned homeward by
himself.

1960
01:36:00,540 --> 01:36:04,301
By the time he was once more at Butte
Creek, his general appearance was a

1961
01:36:04,301 --> 01:36:05,901
thing less to be noticed.

1962
01:36:05,901 --> 01:36:07,702
And there was Shorty, waiting!

1963
01:36:07,702 --> 01:36:13,114
One way and another, the lost dog had
been able to gather some ready money.

1964
01:36:13,114 --> 01:36:18,987
He was cheerful because of this
momentary purseful of prosperity.

1965
01:36:18,987 --> 01:36:22,266
“And so I come back, yu’ see,” he said.

1966
01:36:22,266 --> 01:36:27,231
“For I figured on getting Pedro back as
soon as I could when I sold him to yu’.”

1967
01:36:27,231 --> 01:36:30,350
“You’re behind the times,
Shorty,” said Balaam.

1968
01:36:30,350 --> 01:36:32,229
Shorty looked blank.

1969
01:36:32,229 --> 01:36:34,293
“You’ve sure not sold Pedro?”

1970
01:36:34,293 --> 01:36:35,468
he exclaimed.

1971
01:36:35,468 --> 01:36:40,372
“Them Indians,” said Balaam,
“got after me on the Bow Leg trail.

1972
01:36:40,372 --> 01:36:43,043
Got after me and that Virginia man.

1973
01:36:43,043 --> 01:36:44,803
But they didn’t get me.”

1974
01:36:44,803 --> 01:36:49,633
Balaam wagged his bullet head to imply
that this escape was due to

1975
01:36:49,633 --> 01:36:52,390
his own superior intelligence.

1976
01:36:52,390 --> 01:36:56,009
The Virginian had been stupid,
and so the Indians had got him.

1977
01:36:56,009 --> 01:36:59,268
“And they shot your horse,”
Balaam finished.

1978
01:36:59,268 --> 01:37:02,087
“Stop and get some dinner with the boys.”

1979
01:37:02,087 --> 01:37:07,422
Having eaten, Shorty rode
away in mournful spirits.

1980
01:37:07,422 --> 01:37:10,824
For he had made so sure of once more
riding and talking with Pedro,

1981
01:37:10,824 --> 01:37:13,510
his friend whom he had
taught to shake hands.

1982
01:37:13,510 --> 01:37:14,623
CHAPTER XXVII

1983
01:37:14,623 --> 01:37:15,990
Grandmother Stark

1984
01:37:15,990 --> 01:37:20,413
Except for its chair and bed,
the cabin was stripped almost bare.

1985
01:37:20,413 --> 01:37:25,706
Amid its emptiness of dismantled shelves
and walls and floor,

1986
01:37:25,706 --> 01:37:31,311
only the tiny ancestress still hung in
her place, last token of the

1987
01:37:31,311 --> 01:37:32,551
home that had been.

1988
01:37:32,551 --> 01:37:37,564
This miniature, tacked against the
despoiled boards, and its descendant,

1989
01:37:37,564 --> 01:37:42,245
the angry girl with her hand on an open
box-lid, made a sort of couple in the

1990
01:37:42,245 --> 01:37:49,609
loneliness: she on the wall sweet and
serene, she by the box sweet and stormy.

1991
01:37:49,609 --> 01:37:53,381
The picture was her final treasure
waiting to be packed for the journey.

1992
01:37:53,381 --> 01:37:58,166
In whatever room she had called her own
since childhood, there it had also lived

1993
01:37:58,166 --> 01:38:02,441
and looked at her, not quite familiar,
not quite smiling, but in its prim

1994
01:38:02,441 --> 01:38:05,878
colonial hues delicate
as some pressed flower.

1995
01:38:05,878 --> 01:38:12,750
Its pale oval, of color blue and rose and
flaxen, in a battered,

1996
01:38:12,750 --> 01:38:17,715
pretty gold frame, unconquerably
pervaded any surroundings with a

1997
01:38:17,715 --> 01:38:19,744
something like last year’s lavender.

1998
01:38:19,744 --> 01:38:27,932
Till yesterday a Crow Indian war-bonnet
had hung next it, a sumptuous cascade of

1999
01:38:27,932 --> 01:38:33,142
feathers; on the other side a bow with
arrows had dangled; opposite had been

2000
01:38:33,142 --> 01:38:38,082
the skin of a silver fox;
over the door had spread the antlers of

2001
01:38:38,082 --> 01:38:44,777
a blacktail deer; a bearskin
stretched beneath it.

2002
01:38:44,777 --> 01:38:50,359
Thus had the whole cozy log cabin been
upholstered, lavish with trophies of the

2003
01:38:50,359 --> 01:38:55,193
frontier; and yet it was in front of the
miniature that the visitors used to

2004
01:38:55,193 --> 01:38:55,729
stop.

2005
01:38:55,729 --> 01:38:58,892
Shining quietly now in the cabin’s
blackness this summer day,

2006
01:38:58,892 --> 01:39:01,713
the heirloom was presiding until the
end.

2007
01:39:01,713 --> 01:39:05,234
And as Molly Wood’s eyes fell upon her
ancestress of Bennington,

2008
01:39:05,234 --> 01:39:11,428
1777, there flashed a spark of steel in
them, alone here in the room that

2009
01:39:11,428 --> 01:39:12,807
she was leaving forever.

2010
01:39:12,807 --> 01:39:16,965
She was not going to teach school any
more on Bear Creek, Wyoming;

2011
01:39:16,965 --> 01:39:19,983
she was going home to
Bennington, Vermont.

2012
01:39:19,983 --> 01:39:25,625
When time came for school to open again,
there should be a new schoolmarm.

2013
01:39:25,625 --> 01:39:31,044
This was the momentous result of that
visit which the Virginian had paid her.

2014
01:39:31,044 --> 01:39:34,430
He had told her that he was coming
for his hour soon.

2015
01:39:34,430 --> 01:39:37,692
From that hour she had decided to escape.

2016
01:39:37,692 --> 01:39:40,223
She was running away from her own heart.

2017
01:39:40,223 --> 01:39:45,409
She did not dare to trust herself face to
face again with her potent,

2018
01:39:45,409 --> 01:39:46,831
indomitable lover.

2019
01:39:46,831 --> 01:39:50,826
She longed for him, and therefore she
would never see him again.

2020
01:39:50,826 --> 01:39:54,640
No great-aunt at Dunbarton,
or anybody else that knew her and her

2021
01:39:54,640 --> 01:39:58,767
family, should ever say that she had
married below her station,

2022
01:39:58,767 --> 01:40:00,594
had been an unworthy Stark!

2023
01:40:00,594 --> 01:40:05,147
Accordingly, she had written to the
Virginian, bidding him goodbye,

2024
01:40:05,147 --> 01:40:07,788
and wishing him everything in the world.

2025
01:40:07,788 --> 01:40:11,828
As she happened to be aware that she was
taking everything in the world away from

2026
01:40:11,828 --> 01:40:15,772
him, this letter was not the most easy
of letters to write.

2027
01:40:15,772 --> 01:40:18,298
But she had made the language very kind.

2028
01:40:18,298 --> 01:40:21,610
Yes; it was a thoroughly
kind communication.

2029
01:40:21,610 --> 01:40:25,872
And all because of that momentary visit,
when he had brought back to her two

2030
01:40:25,872 --> 01:40:30,045
novels, Emma and Pride and Prejudice.

2031
01:40:30,045 --> 01:40:31,009
“How do you like them?”

2032
01:40:31,009 --> 01:40:34,310
she had then inquired;
and he had smiled slowly at her.

2033
01:40:34,310 --> 01:40:35,356
“You haven’t read them!”

2034
01:40:35,356 --> 01:40:36,341
she exclaimed.

2035
01:40:36,341 --> 01:40:36,878
“No.”

2036
01:40:36,878 --> 01:40:38,866
“Are you going to tell me there
has been no time?”

2037
01:40:38,866 --> 01:40:39,541
“No.”

2038
01:40:39,541 --> 01:40:44,503
Then Molly had scolded her cowpuncher,
and to this he had listened with

2039
01:40:44,503 --> 01:40:47,904
pleasure undisguised,
as indeed he listened to every

2040
01:40:47,904 --> 01:40:49,482
word that she said.

2041
01:40:49,482 --> 01:40:52,342
“Why, it has come too late,”
he had told her when

2042
01:40:52,342 --> 01:40:53,782
the scolding was over.

2043
01:40:53,782 --> 01:40:58,678
“If I was one of your little scholars
hyeh in Bear Creek schoolhouse,

2044
01:40:58,678 --> 01:41:01,623
yu’ could learn me to like
such frillery I reckon.

2045
01:41:01,623 --> -1:59:59,000
But I’m a mighty ignorant, growed-up man.

2046
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

2047
01:41:04,881 --> -1:59:59,000
“So much the worse for you

2048
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
!”

2049
01:41:06,444 --> 01:41:08,796
said Molly.

2050
01:41:08,796 --> 01:41:10,320
“No.

2051
01:41:10,320 --> 01:41:12,360
I am pretty glad I am a man.

2052
01:41:12,360 --> -1:59:59,000
Else I could not have learned the thing
you have taught me.

2053
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

2054
01:41:16,645 --> 01:41:19,255
But she shut her lips and looked away.

2055
01:41:19,255 --> 01:41:24,202
On the desk was a letter
written from Vermont.

2056
01:41:24,202 --> 01:41:29,222
“If you don’t tell me at once when you
decide,” had said the arch writer,

2057
01:41:29,222 --> 01:41:31,356
“never hope to speak to me again.

2058
01:41:31,356 --> 01:41:34,738
Mary Wood, seriously, I am suspicious.

2059
01:41:34,738 --> 01:41:37,048
Why do you never mention him nowadays?

2060
01:41:37,048 --> 01:41:41,045
How exciting to have you bring a
live cowboy to Bennington!

2061
01:41:41,045 --> 01:41:42,506
We should all come to dinner.

2062
01:41:42,506 --> 01:41:46,958
Though of course I understand now that
many of them have excellent manners.

2063
01:41:46,958 --> 01:41:49,511
But would he wear his pistol at table?”

2064
01:41:49,511 --> 01:41:51,026
So the letter ran on.

2065
01:41:51,026 --> 01:41:55,132
It recounted the latest
home gossip and jokes.

2066
01:41:55,132 --> 01:41:59,546
In answering it Molly Wood had taken no
notice of its childish

2067
01:41:59,546 --> 01:42:00,845
tone here and there.

2068
01:42:00,845 --> 01:42:04,946
“Hyeh’s some of them cactus blossoms yu’
wanted,” said the Virginian.

2069
01:42:04,946 --> 01:42:08,922
His voice recalled the girl
with almost a start.

2070
01:42:08,922 --> 01:42:13,151
“I’ve brought a good hawss I’ve gentled
for yu’, and Taylor’ll keep him

2071
01:42:13,151 --> -1:59:59,000
till I need him.

2072
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

2073
01:42:14,165 --> 01:42:15,764
“Thank you so much!

2074
01:42:15,764 --> 01:42:16,684
but I wish⁠—”

2075
01:42:16,684 --> 01:42:19,853
“I reckon yu’ can’t stop me
lendin’ Taylor a hawss.

2076
01:42:19,853 --> 01:42:23,167
And you cert’nly’ll get sick
schoolteachin’ if yu’

2077
01:42:23,167 --> 01:42:25,324
don’t keep outdoors some.

2078
01:42:25,324 --> -1:59:59,000
Goodbye⁠—till that next time

2079
-1:59:59,000 --> -1:59:59,000
.

2080
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

2081
01:42:29,724 --> 01:42:34,538
“Yes; there’s always a next time,”
she answered, as lightly as she could.

2082
01:42:34,538 --> 01:42:36,046
“There always will be.

2083
01:42:36,046 --> 01:42:37,171
Don’t yu’ know that?”

2084
01:42:37,171 --> 01:42:38,476
She did not reply.

2085
01:42:38,476 --> 01:42:42,981
“I have discouraged spells,”
he pursued, “but I down them.

2086
01:42:42,981 --> 01:42:46,716
For I’ve told yu’ you were
going to love me.

2087
01:42:46,716 --> 01:42:50,377
You are goin’ to learn back the thing
you have taught me.

2088
01:42:50,377 --> 01:42:55,122
I’m not askin’ anything now;
I don’t want you to speak a word to me.

2089
01:42:55,122 --> -1:59:59,000
But I’m never goin’ to quit till ‘next
time’ is no more

2090
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
,

2091
01:42:58,257 --> 01:42:58,417
and

2092
01:42:58,417 --> 01:43:00,377
it’s ‘all the time’ for you and me.”

2093
01:43:00,377 --> 01:43:03,953
With that he had ridden away,
not even touching her hand.

2094
01:43:03,953 --> 01:43:08,830
Long after he had gone she was still in
her chair, her eyes lingering upon his

2095
01:43:08,830 --> 01:43:11,871
flowers, those yellow cups
of the prickly pear.

2096
01:43:11,871 --> 01:43:17,031
At length she had risen impatiently,
caught up the flowers,

2097
01:43:17,031 --> 01:43:20,580
gone with them to the open window⁠—and
then, after all, set them

2098
01:43:20,580 --> 01:43:22,620
with pains in water.

2099
01:43:22,620 --> 01:43:25,218
But today Bear Creek was over.

2100
01:43:25,218 --> 01:43:26,614
She was going home now.

2101
01:43:26,614 --> 01:43:29,360
By the week’s end she would be started.

2102
01:43:29,360 --> 01:43:33,946
By the time the mail brought him her
goodbye letter she would be gone.

2103
01:43:33,946 --> 01:43:34,989
She had acted.

2104
01:43:34,989 --> 01:43:39,255
To Bear Creek, the neighborly,
the friendly, the not comprehending,

2105
01:43:39,255 --> 01:43:42,330
this move had come unlooked for,
and had brought regret.

2106
01:43:42,330 --> 01:43:46,625
Only one hard word had been spoken to
Molly, and that by her next-door

2107
01:43:46,625 --> 01:43:48,972
neighbor and kindest friend.

2108
01:43:48,972 --> 01:43:53,319
In Mrs. Taylor’s house the girl had daily
come and gone as a daughter,

2109
01:43:53,319 --> 01:43:56,231
and that lady reached the subject thus:⁠—

2110
01:43:56,231 --> 01:44:00,883
“When I took Taylor,”
said she, sitting by as Robert Browning

2111
01:44:00,883 --> 01:44:04,342
and Jane Austen were going into their
box, “I married for love.”

2112
01:44:04,342 --> 01:44:06,274
“Do you wish it had been money?”

2113
01:44:06,274 --> 01:44:08,877
said Molly, stooping to her industries.

2114
01:44:08,877 --> 01:44:11,533
“You know both of us better
than that, child.”

2115
01:44:11,533 --> 01:44:15,198
“I know I’ve seen people at home who
couldn’t possibly have

2116
01:44:15,198 --> 01:44:16,678
had any other reason.

2117
01:44:16,678 --> 01:44:18,542
They seemed satisfied, too.”

2118
01:44:18,542 --> 01:44:21,086
“Maybe the poor ignorant things were!”

2119
01:44:21,086 --> 01:44:23,958
“And so I have never been sure
how I might choose.”

2120
01:44:23,958 --> 01:44:26,112
“Yes, you are sure, deary.

2121
01:44:26,112 --> 01:44:27,406
Don’t you think I know you?

2122
01:44:27,406 --> 01:44:30,658
And when it comes over Taylor once in a
while, and he tells me I’m the best

2123
01:44:30,658 --> 01:44:34,141
thing in his life, and I tell him he
ain’t merely the best thing but the only

2124
01:44:34,141 --> 01:44:39,520
thing in mine⁠—him and the children⁠—
why, we just agree we’d do it all over

2125
01:44:39,520 --> 01:44:41,802
the same way if we had the chance.”

2126
01:44:41,802 --> 01:44:43,881
Molly continued to be industrious.

2127
01:44:43,881 --> 01:44:47,706
“And that’s why,” said Mrs. Taylor,
“I want every girl that’s anything to me

2128
01:44:47,706 --> 01:44:49,805
to know her luck when it comes.

2129
01:44:49,805 --> 01:44:52,833
For I was that near telling
Taylor I wouldn’t!”

2130
01:44:52,833 --> 01:44:58,498
“If ever my luck comes,”
said Molly, with her back to her friend,

2131
01:44:58,498 --> 01:45:01,196
“I shall say ‘I will’ at once.”

2132
01:45:01,196 --> 01:45:03,405
“Then you’ll say it at
Bennington next week.”

2133
01:45:03,405 --> 01:45:04,641
Molly wheeled round.

2134
01:45:04,641 --> 01:45:07,086
“Why, you surely will.

2135
01:45:07,086 --> 01:45:10,586
Do you expect he’s going to stay here,
and you in Bennington?”

2136
01:45:10,586 --> 01:45:12,734
And the campaigner sat back in her chair.

2137
01:45:12,734 --> 01:45:13,374
“He?

2138
01:45:13,374 --> 01:45:14,414
Goodness!

2139
01:45:14,414 --> 01:45:14,881
Who is he?”

2140
01:45:14,881 --> 01:45:20,549
“Child, child, you’re talking cross today
because you’re at outs with yourself.

2141
01:45:20,549 --> 01:45:26,338
You’ve been at outs ever since you took
this idea of leaving the school and us

2142
01:45:26,338 --> 01:45:28,321
and everything this needless way.

2143
01:45:28,321 --> 01:45:30,241
You have not treated him right.

2144
01:45:30,241 --> 01:45:33,381
And why, I can’t make out to save me.

2145
01:45:33,381 --> 01:45:36,066
What have you found out all of a sudden?

2146
01:45:36,066 --> 01:45:39,701
If he was not good enough for you,
I⁠—But, oh, it’s a prime

2147
01:45:39,701 --> 01:45:41,683
one you’re losing, Molly.

2148
01:45:41,683 --> 01:45:46,722
When a man like that stays faithful to a
girl ’spite all the chances he gets,

2149
01:45:46,722 --> -1:59:59,000
her luck is come.

2150
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

2151
01:45:47,749 --> 01:45:49,277
“Oh, my luck!

2152
01:45:49,277 --> -1:59:59,000
People have different notions of luck.

2153
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

2154
01:45:52,920 --> 01:45:53,810
“Notions!”

2155
01:45:53,810 --> 01:45:55,931
“He has been very kind.”

2156
01:45:55,931 --> 01:45:56,619
“Kind!”

2157
01:45:56,619 --> 01:46:01,068
And now without further simmering,
Mrs. Taylor’s wrath boiled up and poured

2158
01:46:01,068 --> 01:46:03,298
copiously over Molly Wood.

2159
01:46:03,298 --> 01:46:04,351
“Kind!

2160
01:46:04,351 --> 01:46:07,029
There’s a word you shouldn’t use, my dear.

2161
01:46:07,029 --> 01:46:09,069
No doubt you can spell it.

2162
01:46:09,069 --> 01:46:12,625
But more than its spelling I
guess you don’t know.

2163
01:46:12,625 --> 01:46:17,875
The children can learn what it means from
some of the rest of us folks that don’t

2164
01:46:17,875 --> 01:46:19,430
spell so correct, maybe.”

2165
01:46:19,430 --> 01:46:20,144
“Mrs.

2166
01:46:20,144 --> 01:46:22,185
Taylor, Mrs. Taylor⁠—”

2167
01:46:22,185 --> 01:46:24,101
“I can’t wait, deary.

2168
01:46:24,101 --> 01:46:28,206
Since the roughness looks bigger to you
than the diamond, you had better

2169
01:46:28,206 --> 01:46:30,155
go back to Vermont.

2170
01:46:30,155 --> 01:46:32,967
I expect you’ll find better
grammar there, deary.”

2171
01:46:32,967 --> 01:46:37,117
The good dame stalked out,
and across to her own cabin,

2172
01:46:37,117 --> 01:46:40,332
and left the angry girl among her boxes.

2173
01:46:40,332 --> 01:46:43,931
It was in vain she fell to work upon them.

2174
01:46:43,931 --> 01:46:47,984
Presently something had to be done over
again, and when it was the box held

2175
01:46:47,984 --> 01:46:51,132
several chattels less
than before the readjustment.

2176
01:46:51,132 --> 01:46:56,667
She played a sort of desperate dominos to
fit these objects in the space,

2177
01:46:56,667 --> 01:47:01,292
but here were a paperweight,
a portfolio, with two wretched volumes

2178
01:47:01,292 --> 01:47:06,335
that no chink would harbor;
and letting them fall all at once,

2179
01:47:06,335 --> 01:47:11,103
she straightened herself,
still stormy with revolt,

2180
01:47:11,103 --> 01:47:15,863
eyes and cheeks still hot from the sting
of long-parried truth.

2181
01:47:15,863 --> 01:47:22,527
There, on her wall still,
was the miniature, the little silent

2182
01:47:22,527 --> 01:47:26,679
ancestress; and upon this face
the girl’s glance rested.

2183
01:47:26,679 --> 01:47:31,519
It was as if she appealed to Grandmother
Stark for support and comfort across the

2184
01:47:31,519 --> 01:47:34,412
hundred years which lay between them.

2185
01:47:34,412 --> 01:47:38,550
So the flaxen girl on the wall and she
among the boxes stood a moment face to

2186
01:47:38,550 --> 01:47:43,115
face in seeming communion,
and then the descendant turned

2187
01:47:43,115 --> 01:47:44,197
again to her work.

2188
01:47:44,197 --> 01:47:48,727
But after a desultory touch here and
there she drew a long breath and walked

2189
01:47:48,727 --> 01:47:49,701
to the open door.

2190
01:47:49,701 --> 01:47:52,921
What use was in finishing today,
when she had nearly a week?

2191
01:47:52,921 --> 01:47:57,906
This first spurt of toil had swept the
cabin bare of all indwelling charm,

2192
01:47:57,906 --> 01:47:59,716
and its look was chill.

2193
01:47:59,716 --> 01:48:03,380
Across the lane his horse,
the one he had “gentled” for

2194
01:48:03,380 --> 01:48:05,881
her, was grazing idly.

2195
01:48:05,881 --> 01:48:09,426
She walked there and caught him,
and led him to her gate.

2196
01:48:09,426 --> 01:48:09,804
Mrs.

2197
01:48:09,804 --> 01:48:13,715
Taylor saw her go in,
and soon come out in riding-dress;

2198
01:48:13,715 --> 01:48:17,794
and she watched the girl throw the
saddle on with quick ease⁠—the ease

2199
01:48:17,794 --> 01:48:18,719
he had taught her.

2200
01:48:18,719 --> 01:48:19,074
Mrs.

2201
01:48:19,074 --> 01:48:24,085
Taylor also saw the sharp cut she gave
the horse, and laughed grimly to herself

2202
01:48:24,085 --> 01:48:28,007
in her window as horse and rider
galloped into the beautiful

2203
01:48:28,007 --> 01:48:29,368
sunny loneliness.

2204
01:48:29,368 --> 01:48:33,029
To the punished animal
this switching was new!

2205
01:48:33,029 --> 01:48:39,070
and at its third repetition he turned his
head in surprise, but was no more heeded

2206
01:48:39,070 --> 01:48:44,039
than were the bluffs and flowers where
he was taking his own

2207
01:48:44,039 --> 01:48:46,678
undirected choice of way.

2208
01:48:46,678 --> 01:48:50,447
He carried her over ground she knew by
heart⁠—Corncliff Mesa,

2209
01:48:50,447 --> 01:48:56,994
Crowheart Butte, Westfall’s Crossing,
Upper Canyon; open land and woodland,

2210
01:48:56,994 --> 01:49:00,394
pines and sagebrush,
all silent and grave and

2211
01:49:00,394 --> 01:49:02,107
lustrous in the sunshine.

2212
01:49:02,107 --> 01:49:06,425
Once and again a ranchman greeted her,
and wondered if she had forgotten who he

2213
01:49:06,425 --> 01:49:12,249
was; once she passed some cowpunchers
with a small herd of steers,

2214
01:49:12,249 --> 01:49:13,932
and they stared after her too.

2215
01:49:13,932 --> 01:49:19,439
Bear Creek narrowed, its mountainsides
drew near, its little falls began to

2216
01:49:19,439 --> 01:49:24,713
rush white in midday shadow,
and the horse suddenly pricked his ears.

2217
01:49:24,713 --> 01:49:28,647
Unguided, he was taking this
advantage to go home.

2218
01:49:28,647 --> 01:49:33,326
Though he had made but little way⁠—a mere
beginning yet⁠—on this trail over to

2219
01:49:33,326 --> 01:49:39,013
Sunk Creek, here was already a Sunk
Creek friend whinnying good day to him,

2220
01:49:39,013 --> 01:49:42,601
so he whinnied back and quickened his
pace, and Molly started to life.

2221
01:49:42,601 --> 01:49:45,788
What was Monte doing here?

2222
01:49:45,788 --> 01:49:51,082
She saw the black horse she knew also,
saddled, with reins dragging on the

2223
01:49:51,082 --> 01:49:55,298
trail as the rider had
dropped them to dismount.

2224
01:49:55,298 --> 01:50:01,248
A cold spring bubbled out beyond the next
rock, and she knew her lover’s horse was

2225
01:50:01,248 --> 01:50:03,372
waiting for him while he drank.

2226
01:50:03,372 --> 01:50:07,111
She pulled at the reins,
but loosed them, for to turn and escape

2227
01:50:07,111 --> 01:50:12,243
now was ridiculous; and riding boldly
round the rock, she came upon

2228
01:50:12,243 --> 01:50:13,444
him by the spring.

2229
01:50:13,444 --> 01:50:17,363
One of his arms hung up to its elbow in
the pool, the other was crooked beside

2230
01:50:17,363 --> 01:50:21,100
his head, but the face was sunk downward
against the shelving rock,

2231
01:50:21,100 --> 01:50:23,815
so that she saw only
his black, tangled hair.

2232
01:50:23,815 --> 01:50:29,109
As her horse snorted and tossed his head
she looked swiftly at Monte,

2233
01:50:29,109 --> 01:50:30,329
as if to question him.

2234
01:50:30,329 --> 01:50:34,597
Seeing now the sweat matted on his coat,
and noting the white rim of his eye,

2235
01:50:34,597 --> 01:50:37,678
she sprang and ran to
the motionless figure.

2236
01:50:37,678 --> 01:50:41,618
A patch of blood at his shoulder behind
stained the soft flannel shirt,

2237
01:50:41,618 --> 01:50:45,098
spreading down beneath his belt,
and the man’s whole strong body lay

2238
01:50:45,098 --> 01:50:47,000
slack and pitifully helpless.

2239
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:52,853
She touched the hand beside his head,
but it seemed neither warm nor cold to

2240
01:50:52,853 --> 01:50:56,365
her; she felt for the pulse,
as nearly as she could remember the

2241
01:50:56,365 --> 01:51:00,735
doctors did, but could not tell whether
she imagined or not that it was still;

2242
01:51:00,735 --> 01:51:07,971
twice with painful care her fingers
sought and waited for the beat,

2243
01:51:07,971 --> 01:51:11,004
and her face seemed like
one of listening.

2244
01:51:11,004 --> 01:51:14,924
She leaned down and lifted his other arm
and hand from the water,

2245
01:51:14,924 --> 01:51:19,524
and as their ice-coldness reached her
senses, clearly she saw the patch near

2246
01:51:19,524 --> 01:51:24,863
the shoulder she had moved grow wet with
new blood, and at that sight she grasped

2247
01:51:24,863 --> 01:51:30,156
at the stones upon which
she herself now sank.

2248
01:51:30,156 --> 01:51:33,776
She held tight by two rocks,
sitting straight beside him,

2249
01:51:33,776 --> 01:51:39,109
staring, and murmuring aloud,
“I must not faint; I will not faint;”

2250
01:51:39,109 --> 01:51:44,176
and the standing horses looked at
her, pricking their ears.

2251
01:51:44,176 --> 01:51:49,284
In this cup-like spread of the ravine the
sun shone warmly down,

2252
01:51:49,284 --> 01:51:53,675
the tall red cliff was warm,
the pines were a warm film and filter of

2253
01:51:53,675 --> 01:51:58,123
green; outside the shade across Bear
Creek rose the steep,

2254
01:51:58,123 --> 01:52:04,526
soft, open yellow hill,
warm and high to the blue,

2255
01:52:04,526 --> 01:52:08,796
and Bear Creek tumbled
upon its sunsparkling stones.

2256
01:52:08,796 --> 01:52:13,574
The two horses on the margin trail still
looked at the spring and trees,

2257
01:52:13,574 --> 01:52:20,479
where sat the neat flaxen girl so rigid
by the slack prone body in its flannel

2258
01:52:20,479 --> 01:52:22,863
shirt and leathern chaps.

2259
01:52:22,863 --> 01:52:24,915
Suddenly her face livened.

2260
01:52:24,915 --> 01:52:26,434
“But the blood ran!”

2261
01:52:26,434 --> 01:52:31,530
she exclaimed, as if to the horses,
her companions in this.

2262
01:52:31,530 --> 01:52:35,747
She moved to him, and put her hand in
through his shirt against his heart.

2263
01:52:35,747 --> 01:52:39,956
Next moment she had sprung up and was at
his saddle, searching,

2264
01:52:39,956 --> 01:52:45,388
then swiftly went on to her own and got
her small flask and was back beside him.

2265
01:52:45,388 --> 01:52:50,226
Here was the cold water he had sought,
and she put it against his forehead and

2266
01:52:50,226 --> 01:52:52,031
drenched the wounded shoulder with it.

2267
01:52:52,031 --> 01:52:56,032
Three times she tried to move him,
so he might lie more easy,

2268
01:52:56,032 --> 01:53:01,687
but his dead weight was too much,
and desisting, she sat close and raised

2269
01:53:01,687 --> 01:53:04,918
his head to let it rest against her.

2270
01:53:04,918 --> 01:53:09,000
Thus she saw the blood that was running
from in front of the shoulder also;

2271
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:11,139
but she said no more about fainting.

2272
01:53:11,139 --> 01:53:15,419
She tore strips from her dress and soaked
them, keeping them cold and wet upon

2273
01:53:15,419 --> 01:53:21,316
both openings of his wound,
and she drew her pocketknife out and cut

2274
01:53:21,316 --> 01:53:23,237
his shirt away from the place.

2275
01:53:23,237 --> 01:53:28,774
As she continually rinsed and cleaned it,
she watched his eyelashes,

2276
01:53:28,774 --> 01:53:33,049
long and soft and thick,
but they did not stir.

2277
01:53:33,049 --> 01:53:37,168
Again she tried the flask,
but failed from being still too gentle,

2278
01:53:37,168 --> 01:53:41,145
and her searching eyes fell upon
ashes near the pool.

2279
01:53:41,145 --> 01:53:47,855
Still undispersed by the weather lay the
small charred ends of a fire he and she

2280
01:53:47,855 --> 01:53:52,120
had made once here together,
to boil coffee and fry trout.

2281
01:53:52,120 --> 01:53:55,545
She built another fire now,
and when the flames were going well,

2282
01:53:55,545 --> 01:54:00,113
filled her flask-cup from the spring and
set it to heat.

2283
01:54:00,113 --> 01:54:04,515
Meanwhile, she returned to nurse
his head and wound.

2284
01:54:04,515 --> 01:54:07,678
Her cold water had stopped the bleeding.

2285
01:54:07,678 --> 01:54:12,983
Then she poured her brandy in the
steaming cup, and, made rough by her

2286
01:54:12,983 --> 01:54:17,084
desperate helplessness,
forced some between his lips and teeth.

2287
01:54:17,084 --> 01:54:22,411
Instantly, almost, she felt the tremble
of life creeping back,

2288
01:54:22,411 --> 01:54:26,763
and as his deep eyes opened upon her she
sat still and mute.

2289
01:54:26,763 --> 01:54:31,817
But the gaze seemed luminous with an
unnoting calm, and she wondered if

2290
01:54:31,817 --> 01:54:36,012
perhaps he could not recognize her;
she watched this internal clearness of

2291
01:54:36,012 --> 01:54:40,766
his vision, scarcely daring to breathe,
until presently he began to speak,

2292
01:54:40,766 --> 01:54:44,955
with the same profound and clear
impersonality sounding in

2293
01:54:44,955 --> 01:54:47,786
his slowly uttered words.

2294
01:54:47,786 --> 01:54:51,693
“I thought they had found me.

2295
01:54:51,693 --> 01:54:56,796
I expected they were going to kill me.”

2296
01:54:56,796 --> 01:55:01,177
He stopped, and she gave him more of the
hot drink, which he took,

2297
01:55:01,177 --> 01:55:05,227
still lying and looking at her as if the
present did not reach his senses.

2298
01:55:05,227 --> 01:55:07,344
“I knew hands were touching me.

2299
01:55:07,344 --> 01:55:09,497
I reckon I was not dead.

2300
01:55:09,497 --> 01:55:14,087
I knew about them soon as they began,
only I could not interfere.”

2301
01:55:14,087 --> 01:55:15,005
He waited again.

2302
01:55:15,005 --> 01:55:18,166
“It is mighty strange where I have been.

2303
01:55:18,166 --> 01:55:19,600
No.

2304
01:55:19,600 --> 01:55:21,641
Mighty natural.”

2305
01:55:21,641 --> 01:55:26,996
Then he went back into his revery,
and lay with his eyes still full open

2306
01:55:26,996 --> 01:55:29,395
upon her where she sat motionless.

2307
01:55:29,395 --> 01:55:33,539
She began to feel a greater awe in this
living presence than when it had been

2308
01:55:33,539 --> 01:55:37,879
his body with an ice-cold hand;
and she quietly spoke his name,

2309
01:55:37,879 --> 01:55:40,439
venturing scarcely more than a whisper.

2310
01:55:40,439 --> 01:55:44,854
At this, some nearer thing
wakened in his look.

2311
01:55:44,854 --> 01:55:47,533
“But it was you all along,” he resumed.

2312
01:55:47,533 --> 01:55:49,197
“It is you now.

2313
01:55:49,197 --> 01:55:50,533
You must not stay⁠—”

2314
01:55:50,533 --> 01:55:54,392
Weakness overcame him,
and his eyes closed.

2315
01:55:54,392 --> 01:55:58,507
She sat ministering to him,
and when he roused again,

2316
01:55:58,507 --> 01:56:01,831
he began anxiously at once:
“You must not stay.

2317
01:56:01,831 --> 01:56:03,117
They would get you, too.”

2318
01:56:03,117 --> 01:56:07,835
She glanced at him with a sort of
fierceness, then reached for his pistol,

2319
01:56:07,835 --> 01:56:11,186
in which was nothing
but blackened empty cartridges.

2320
01:56:11,186 --> 01:56:15,699
She threw these out and drew six from his
belt, loaded the weapon,

2321
01:56:15,699 --> 01:56:17,400
and snapped shut its hinge.

2322
01:56:17,400 --> 01:56:22,146
“Please take it,” he said,
more anxious and more himself.

2323
01:56:22,146 --> 01:56:23,566
“I ain’t worth tryin’ to keep.

2324
01:56:23,566 --> 01:56:24,459
Look at me!”

2325
01:56:24,459 --> 01:56:25,405
“Are you giving up?”

2326
01:56:25,405 --> 01:56:29,275
she inquired, trying to put
scorn in her tone.

2327
01:56:29,275 --> 01:56:30,867
Then she seated herself.

2328
01:56:30,867 --> 01:56:33,608
“Where is the sense in both of us⁠—”

2329
01:56:33,608 --> 01:56:36,378
“You had better save your
strength,” she interrupted.

2330
01:56:36,378 --> 01:56:37,483
He tried to sit up.

2331
01:56:37,483 --> 01:56:38,608
“Lie down!”

2332
01:56:38,608 --> 01:56:39,598
she ordered.

2333
01:56:39,598 --> 01:56:42,573
He sank obediently, and began to smile.

2334
01:56:42,573 --> 01:56:46,670
When she saw that, she smiled too,
and unexpectedly took his hand.

2335
01:56:46,670 --> 01:56:48,667
“Listen, friend,” said she.

2336
01:56:48,667 --> 01:56:51,190
“Nobody shall get you,
and nobody shall get me.

2337
01:56:51,190 --> 01:56:52,905
Now take some more brandy.”

2338
01:56:52,905 --> 01:56:56,180
“It must be noon,” said the cowpuncher,
when she had drawn her

2339
01:56:56,180 --> 01:56:57,300
hand away from him.

2340
01:56:57,300 --> 01:57:03,294
“I remember it was dark when⁠—when⁠—
when I can remember.

2341
01:57:03,294 --> 01:57:06,625
I reckon they were scared to follow me in
so close to settlers.

2342
01:57:06,625 --> -1:59:59,000
Else they would have been here.

2343
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

2344
01:57:09,275 --> 01:57:11,885
“You must rest,” she observed.

2345
01:57:11,885 --> 01:57:15,297
She broke the soft ends of some
evergreen, and putting them beneath his

2346
01:57:15,297 --> 01:57:19,671
head, went to the horses,
loosened the cinches,

2347
01:57:19,671 --> 01:57:23,002
took off the bridles,
led them to drink, and

2348
01:57:23,002 --> 01:57:24,173
picketed them to feed.

2349
01:57:24,173 --> 01:57:28,689
Further still, to leave nothing undone
which she could herself manage,

2350
01:57:28,689 --> 01:57:31,865
she took the horses’ saddles off to
refold the blankets when the time should

2351
01:57:31,865 --> 01:57:34,023
come, and meanwhile brought them for
him.

2352
01:57:34,023 --> 01:57:36,376
But he put them away from him.

2353
01:57:36,376 --> 01:57:39,506
He was sitting up against a rock,
stronger evidently, and

2354
01:57:39,506 --> 01:57:41,003
asking for cold water.

2355
01:57:41,003 --> 01:57:44,666
His head was fire-hot,
and the paleness beneath his swarthy

2356
01:57:44,666 --> 01:57:47,555
skin had changed to a deepening flush.

2357
01:57:47,555 --> 01:57:49,564
“Only five miles!”

2358
01:57:49,564 --> 01:57:51,618
she said to him, bathing his head.

2359
01:57:51,618 --> 01:57:52,583
“Yes.

2360
01:57:52,583 --> 01:57:55,219
I must hold it steady,”
he answered, waving his

2361
01:57:55,219 --> 01:57:56,290
hand at the cliff.

2362
01:57:56,290 --> 01:57:59,774
She told him to try and keep it steady
until they got home.

2363
01:57:59,774 --> 01:58:01,224
“Yes,” he repeated.

2364
01:58:01,224 --> 01:58:02,978
“Only five miles.

2365
01:58:02,978 --> 01:58:04,851
But it’s fightin’ to turn around.”

2366
01:58:04,851 --> 01:58:08,251
Half aware that he was becoming
lightheaded, he looked from the rock to

2367
01:58:08,251 --> 01:58:11,938
her and from her to the
rock with dilating eyes.

2368
01:58:11,938 --> 01:58:14,296
“We can hold it together,” she said.

2369
01:58:14,296 --> 01:58:16,234
“You must get on your horse.”

2370
01:58:16,234 --> 01:58:20,765
She took his handkerchief from round his
neck, knotting it with her own,

2371
01:58:20,765 --> 01:58:25,781
and to make more bandage she ran to the
roll of clothes behind his saddle and

2372
01:58:25,781 --> 01:58:27,621
tore in halves a clean shirt.

2373
01:58:27,621 --> 01:58:30,581
A handkerchief fell from it,
which she seized also,

2374
01:58:30,581 --> 01:58:34,626
and opening, saw her own
initials by the hem.

2375
01:58:34,626 --> 01:58:39,957
Then she remembered: she saw again their
first meeting, the swollen river,

2376
01:58:39,957 --> 01:58:45,216
the overset stage, the unknown horseman
who carried her to the bank on his

2377
01:58:45,216 --> 01:58:51,459
saddle and went away unthanked⁠—her
whole first adventure on that first day

2378
01:58:51,459 --> 01:58:55,939
of her coming to this new country⁠—and
now she knew how her long-forgotten

2379
01:58:55,939 --> 01:58:57,730
handkerchief had gone that day.

2380
01:58:57,730 --> 01:59:01,490
She refolded it gently and put it back in
his bundle, for there was

2381
01:59:01,490 --> 01:59:03,128
enough bandage without it.

2382
01:59:03,128 --> 01:59:06,640
She said not a word to him,
and he placed a wrong meaning upon the

2383
01:59:06,640 --> 01:59:09,924
look which she gave him as she returned
to bind his shoulder.

2384
01:59:09,924 --> 01:59:15,967
“It don’t hurt so much,”
he assured her (though extreme pain was

2385
01:59:15,967 --> 01:59:18,967
clearing his head for the moment,
and he had been able to hold

2386
01:59:18,967 --> 01:59:20,368
the cliff from turning).

2387
01:59:20,368 --> 01:59:22,427
“Yu’ must not squander your pity.”

2388
01:59:22,427 --> 01:59:25,271
“Do not squander your strength,” said she.

2389
01:59:25,271 --> 01:59:28,528
“Oh, I could put up a
pretty good fight now!”

2390
01:59:28,528 --> 01:59:33,168
But he tottered in showing her how strong
he was, and she told him that,

2391
01:59:33,168 --> 01:59:35,883
after all, he was a child still.

2392
01:59:35,883 --> 01:59:40,645
“Yes,” he slowly said,
looking after her as she went to bring

2393
01:59:40,645 --> 01:59:45,208
his horse, “the same child that wanted
to touch the moon, I guess.”

2394
01:59:45,208 --> 01:59:51,194
And during the slow climb down into the
saddle from a rock to which she helped

2395
01:59:51,194 --> 01:59:57,722
him he said, “You have got to be the man
all through this mess.”

2396
01:59:57,722 --> 02:00:02,607
She saw his teeth clinched and his
drooping muscles compelled by will;

2397
02:00:02,607 --> 02:00:08,462
and as he rode and she walked to lend
him support, leading her horse by a

2398
02:00:08,462 --> 02:00:13,242
backward-stretched left hand,
she counted off the distance to him

2399
02:00:13,242 --> 02:00:19,025
continually⁠—the increasing gain,
the lessening road, the landmarks

2400
02:00:19,025 --> 02:00:24,366
nearing and dropping behind;
here was the tree with the wasp-nest

2401
02:00:24,366 --> 02:00:28,003
gone; now the burned cabin was passed;
now the cottonwoods at the

2402
02:00:28,003 --> 02:00:29,597
ford were in sight.

2403
02:00:29,597 --> 02:00:34,429
He was silent, and held to the saddle-
horn, leaning more and more against his

2404
02:00:34,429 --> 02:00:39,210
two hands clasped over it;
and just after they had made the

2405
02:00:39,210 --> 02:00:44,017
crossing he fell, without a sound
slipping to the grass,

2406
02:00:44,017 --> 02:00:46,008
and his descent broken by her.

2407
02:00:46,008 --> 02:00:50,057
But it started the blood a little,
and she dared not leave him to seek

2408
02:00:50,057 --> 02:00:50,507
help.

2409
02:00:50,507 --> 02:00:55,820
She gave him the last of the flask and
all the water he craved.

2410
02:00:55,820 --> 02:00:58,335
Revived, he managed to smile.

2411
02:00:58,335 --> -1:59:59,000
“Yu’ see, I ain’t worth keeping.

2412
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

2413
02:01:00,636 --> 02:01:02,896
“It’s only a mile,” said she.

2414
02:01:02,896 --> 02:01:07,834
So she found a log, a fallen trunk,
and he crawled to that,

2415
02:01:07,834 --> 02:01:12,037
and from there crawled to his saddle,
and she marched on with him,

2416
02:01:12,037 --> 02:01:14,815
talking, bidding him
note the steps accomplished.

2417
02:01:14,815 --> 02:01:19,205
For the next half-mile they went thus,
the silent man clinched on the horse,

2418
02:01:19,205 --> 02:01:23,739
and by his side the girl walking and
cheering him forward,

2419
02:01:23,739 --> 02:01:25,940
when suddenly he began to speak:⁠—

2420
02:01:25,940 --> -1:59:59,000
“I will say goodbye to you now, ma’am.

2421
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

2422
02:01:26,930 --> 02:01:28,353
She did not understand,
at first, the significance of this.

2423
02:01:28,353 --> 02:01:31,618
“He is getting away,”
pursued the Virginian.

2424
02:01:31,618 --> 02:01:34,216
“I must ask you to excuse me, ma’am.”

2425
02:01:34,216 --> 02:01:38,727
It was a long while since her lord had
addressed her as “ma’am.”

2426
02:01:38,727 --> 02:01:43,068
As she looked at him in growing
apprehension, he turned Monte and would

2427
02:01:43,068 --> 02:01:45,388
have ridden away, but
she caught the bridle.

2428
02:01:45,388 --> 02:01:50,611
“You must take me home,”
said she, with ready inspiration.

2429
02:01:50,611 --> 02:01:53,171
“I am afraid of the Indians.”

2430
02:01:53,171 --> 02:01:55,777
“Why, you⁠—why, they’ve all gone.

2431
02:01:55,777 --> 02:01:57,150
There he goes.

2432
02:01:57,150 --> 02:01:59,213
Ma’am⁠—that hawss⁠—”

2433
02:01:59,213 --> 02:02:04,100
“No,” said she, holding firmly his rein
and quickening her step.

2434
02:02:04,100 --> 02:02:07,928
“A gentleman does not invite a lady to go
out riding and leave her.”

2435
02:02:07,928 --> 02:02:10,764
His eyes lost their purpose.

2436
02:02:10,764 --> 02:02:12,462
“I’ll cert’nly take you home.

2437
02:02:12,462 --> 02:02:16,846
That sorrel has gone in there by the
wallow, and Judge Henry will

2438
02:02:16,846 --> 02:02:17,591
understand.”

2439
02:02:17,591 --> 02:02:23,318
With his eyes watching imaginary objects,
he rode and rambled and it was now the

2440
02:02:23,318 --> 02:02:28,271
girl who was silent,
except to keep his mind from its half-

2441
02:02:28,271 --> 02:02:31,035
fixed idea of the sorrel.

2442
02:02:31,035 --> 02:02:37,139
As he grew more fluent she hastened still
more, listening to head off that notion

2443
02:02:37,139 --> 02:02:43,652
of return, skilfully inventing questions
to engage him, so that when she brought

2444
02:02:43,652 --> 02:02:49,169
him to her gate she held him in a manner
subjected, answering faithfully the

2445
02:02:49,169 --> 02:02:55,088
shrewd unrealities which she devised,
whatever makeshifts she could summon to

2446
02:02:55,088 --> 02:03:00,430
her mind; and next she had got him
inside her dwelling and set him down

2447
02:03:00,430 --> 02:03:06,542
docile, but now completely wandering;
and then⁠—no help was at hand, even

2448
02:03:06,542 --> 02:03:07,159
here.

2449
02:03:07,159 --> 02:03:11,867
She had made sure of aid from next door,
and there she hastened,

2450
02:03:11,867 --> 02:03:16,992
to find the Taylor’s cabin locked and
silent; and this meant that parents and

2451
02:03:16,992 --> 02:03:21,241
children were gone to drive;
nor might she be luckier at her next

2452
02:03:21,241 --> 02:03:26,595
nearest neighbors’, should she travel
the intervening mile to fetch them.

2453
02:03:26,595 --> 02:03:30,694
With a mind jostled once more into
uncertainty, she returned to her room,

2454
02:03:30,694 --> 02:03:32,584
and saw a change in him already.

2455
02:03:32,584 --> 02:03:37,553
Illness had stridden upon him;
his face was not as she had left it,

2456
02:03:37,553 --> 02:03:43,759
and the whole body, the splendid supple
horseman, showed sickness in every line

2457
02:03:43,759 --> 02:03:54,700
and limb, its spurs and pistol and bold
leather chaps a mockery of trappings.

2458
02:03:54,700 --> 02:03:58,977
She looked at him, and decision came back
to her, clear and steady.

2459
02:03:58,977 --> 02:04:02,338
She supported him over to her bed and
laid him on it.

2460
02:04:02,338 --> 02:04:09,361
His head sank flat, and his loose,
nerveless arms stayed as she left them.

2461
02:04:09,361 --> 02:04:12,401
Then among her packing-boxes and beneath
the little miniature,

2462
02:04:12,401 --> 02:04:17,231
blue and flaxen and gold upon its lonely
wall, she undressed him.

2463
02:04:17,231 --> 02:04:21,471
He was cold, and she covered him to the
face, and arranged the pillow,

2464
02:04:21,471 --> 02:04:25,845
and got from its box her scarlet and
black Navajo blanket and

2465
02:04:25,845 --> 02:04:27,099
spread it over him.

2466
02:04:27,099 --> 02:04:31,688
There was no more that she could do,
and she sat down by him to wait.

2467
02:04:31,688 --> 02:04:37,622
Among the many and many things that came
into her mind was a word he said to her

2468
02:04:37,622 --> 02:04:39,731
lightly a long while ago.

2469
02:04:39,731 --> 02:04:44,462
“Cowpunchers do not live long enough to
get old,” he had told her.

2470
02:04:44,462 --> 02:04:48,989
And now she looked at the head upon the
pillow, grave and strong,

2471
02:04:48,989 --> 02:04:52,355
but still the head of
splendid, unworn youth.

2472
02:04:52,355 --> 02:04:57,564
At the distant jingle of the wagon in the
lane she was out, and had met

2473
02:04:57,564 --> 02:04:59,760
her returning neighbors midway.

2474
02:04:59,760 --> 02:05:03,544
They heard her with amazement,
and came in haste to the bedside;

2475
02:05:03,544 --> 02:05:07,387
then Taylor departed to spread news of
the Indians and bring the doctor,

2476
02:05:07,387 --> 02:05:08,968
twenty-five miles away.

2477
02:05:08,968 --> 02:05:14,248
The two women friends stood alone again,
as they had stood in the morning when

2478
02:05:14,248 --> 02:05:15,969
anger had been between them.

2479
02:05:15,969 --> 02:05:18,940
“Kiss me, deary,” said Mrs. Taylor.

2480
02:05:18,940 --> -1:59:59,000
“Now I will look after him⁠—and you’ll
need some looking after yourself.

2481
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

2482
02:05:23,068 --> 02:05:31,242
But on returning from her cabin with what
store she possessed of lint and

2483
02:05:31,242 --> 02:05:36,145
stimulants, she encountered a
rebel, independent as ever.

2484
02:05:36,145 --> 02:05:41,023
Molly would hear no talk about saving her
strength, would not be in any room but

2485
02:05:41,023 --> 02:05:45,275
this one until the doctor should arrive;
then perhaps it would be time

2486
02:05:45,275 --> 02:05:46,831
to think about resting.

2487
02:05:46,831 --> 02:05:51,675
So together the dame and the girl rinsed
the man’s wound and wrapped him in clean

2488
02:05:51,675 --> 02:05:57,982
things, and did all the little that they
knew⁠—which was, in truth,

2489
02:05:57,982 --> 02:05:59,386
the very thing needed.

2490
02:05:59,386 --> 02:06:02,530
Then they sat watching
him toss and mutter.

2491
02:06:02,530 --> 02:06:06,503
It was no longer upon Indians or the
sorrel horse that his talk seemed to

2492
02:06:06,503 --> 02:06:11,781
run, or anything recent,
apparently, always excepting his work.

2493
02:06:11,781 --> 02:06:17,042
This flowingly merged with whatever scene
he was inventing or living again,

2494
02:06:17,042 --> 02:06:21,340
and he wandered unendingly in that
incompatible world we dream in.

2495
02:06:21,340 --> 02:06:25,814
Through the medley of events and names,
often thickly spoken,

2496
02:06:25,814 --> 02:06:31,468
but rising at times to grotesque
coherence, the listeners now and then

2497
02:06:31,468 --> 02:06:34,960
could piece out the reference
from their own knowledge.

2498
02:06:34,960 --> 02:06:38,764
“Monte,” for example,
continually addressed,

2499
02:06:38,764 --> 02:06:43,647
and Molly heard her own name,
but invariably as “Miss Wood”; nothing

2500
02:06:43,647 --> 02:06:47,600
less respectful came out,
and frequently he answered

2501
02:06:47,600 --> 02:06:48,769
someone as “ma’am.”

2502
02:06:48,769 --> 02:06:55,090
At these fragments of revelation Mrs.
Taylor abstained from speech,

2503
02:06:55,090 --> 02:06:58,451
but eyed Molly Wood with
caustic reproach.

2504
02:06:58,451 --> 02:07:02,257
As the night wore on,
short lulls of silence intervened,

2505
02:07:02,257 --> 02:07:06,513
and the watchers were deceived into hope
that the fever was abating.

2506
02:07:06,513 --> 02:07:10,756
And when the Virginian sat quietly up in
bed, essayed to move his bandage,

2507
02:07:10,756 --> 02:07:14,554
and looked steadily at Mrs. Taylor,
she rose quickly and went to him with a

2508
02:07:14,554 --> 02:07:16,909
question as to how he was doing.

2509
02:07:16,909 --> 02:07:22,590
“Rise on your laigs, you polecat,”
said he, “and tell them you’re a liar.”

2510
02:07:22,590 --> 02:07:25,869
The good dame gasped,
then bade him lie down,

2511
02:07:25,869 --> 02:07:30,080
and he obeyed her with that strange
double understanding of the delirious;

2512
02:07:30,080 --> 02:07:34,120
for even while submitting,
he muttered “liar,” “polecat,”

2513
02:07:34,120 --> 02:07:40,365
and then “Trampas.”

2514
02:07:40,365 --> 02:07:44,337
At that name light flashed on Mrs.
Taylor, and she turned to Molly;

2515
02:07:44,337 --> 02:07:48,291
and there was the girl struggling with a
fit of mirth at his speech;

2516
02:07:48,291 --> 02:07:50,631
but the laughter was fast
becoming a painful seizure.

2517
02:07:50,631 --> 02:07:51,015
Mrs.

2518
02:07:51,015 --> 02:07:54,015
Taylor walked Molly up and down,
speaking immediately

2519
02:07:54,015 --> 02:07:55,435
to arrest her attention.

2520
02:07:55,435 --> 02:07:58,455
“You might as well know it,” she said.

2521
02:07:58,455 --> 02:08:01,470
“He would blame me for speaking of it,
but where’s the harm

2522
02:08:01,470 --> 02:08:02,870
all this while after?

2523
02:08:02,870 --> 02:08:05,470
And you would never hear
it from his mouth.

2524
02:08:05,470 --> 02:08:09,111
Molly, child, they say Trampas would kill
him if he dared, and that’s

2525
02:08:09,111 --> 02:08:10,924
on account of you.”

2526
02:08:10,924 --> 02:08:14,266
“I never saw Trampas,”
said Molly, fixing her

2527
02:08:14,266 --> 02:08:15,557
eyes upon the speaker.

2528
02:08:15,557 --> 02:08:16,808
“No, deary.

2529
02:08:16,808 --> 02:08:21,671
But before a lot of men⁠—Taylor has told
me about it⁠—Trampas spoke

2530
02:08:21,671 --> 02:08:25,699
disrespectfully of you,
and before them all he made Trampas say

2531
02:08:25,699 --> 02:08:27,299
he was a liar.

2532
02:08:27,299 --> 02:08:32,568
That is what he did when you were almost
a stranger among us,

2533
02:08:32,568 --> 02:08:35,398
and he had not started seeing
so much of you.

2534
02:08:35,398 --> 02:08:39,877
I expect Trampas is the only enemy he
ever had in this country.

2535
02:08:39,877 --> -1:59:59,000
But he would never let
you know about that.

2536
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

2537
02:08:41,878 --> 02:08:45,592
“No,” whispered Molly; “I did not know.”

2538
02:08:45,592 --> 02:08:46,596
“Steve!”

2539
02:08:46,596 --> 02:08:49,990
the sick man now cried
out, in poignant appeal.

2540
02:08:49,990 --> 02:08:50,783
“Steve!”

2541
02:08:50,783 --> 02:08:55,331
To the women it was a name unknown⁠—
unknown as was also this deep inward tide

2542
02:08:55,331 --> 02:08:59,331
of feeling which he could no longer
conceal, being himself no longer.

2543
02:08:59,331 --> 02:09:04,070
“No, Steve,” he said next,
and muttering followed.

2544
02:09:04,070 --> 02:09:05,170
“It ain’t so!”

2545
02:09:05,170 --> 02:09:08,664
he shouted; and then cunningly in a
lowered voice, “Steve,

2546
02:09:08,664 --> 02:09:09,944
I have lied for you.”

2547
02:09:09,944 --> 02:09:12,649
In time Mrs. Taylor spoke some advice.

2548
02:09:12,649 --> 02:09:15,403
“You had better go to bed, child.

2549
02:09:15,403 --> 02:09:17,765
You look about ready for
the doctor yourself.”

2550
02:09:17,765 --> 02:09:20,005
“Then I will wait for him,” said Molly.

2551
02:09:20,005 --> 02:09:25,737
So the two nurses continued to sit until
darkness at the windows weakened into

2552
02:09:25,737 --> 02:09:28,223
gray, and the lamp was no more needed.

2553
02:09:28,223 --> 02:09:30,382
Their patient was rambling again.

2554
02:09:30,382 --> 02:09:35,433
Yet, into whatever scenes he went,
there in some guise did the throb of his

2555
02:09:35,433 --> 02:09:38,989
pain evidently follow him,
and he lay hitching his great shoulder

2556
02:09:38,989 --> 02:09:41,046
as if to rid it of the cumbrance.

2557
02:09:41,046 --> 02:09:45,134
They waited for the doctor,
not daring much more than to turn

2558
02:09:45,134 --> 02:09:51,626
pillows and give what other ease they
could; and then, instead of the doctor,

2559
02:09:51,626 --> 02:09:57,420
came a messenger, about noon,
to say he was gone on a visit some

2560
02:09:57,420 --> 02:10:03,400
thirty miles beyond,
where Taylor had followed to bring him

2561
02:10:03,400 --> 02:10:07,141
here as soon as might be.

2562
02:10:07,141 --> 02:10:13,351
At this Molly consented to rest and to
watch, turn about; and once she was over

2563
02:10:13,351 --> 02:10:17,995
in her friend’s house lying down,
they tried to keep her there.

2564
02:10:17,995 --> 02:10:22,716
But the revolutionist could not be put
down, and when, as a last pretext,

2565
02:10:22,716 --> 02:10:28,411
Mrs. Taylor urged the proprieties and
conventions, the pale girl from Vermont

2566
02:10:28,411 --> 02:10:33,711
laughed sweetly in her face and returned
to sit by the sick man.

2567
02:10:33,711 --> 02:10:41,016
With the approach of the second night his
fever seemed to rise and master him more

2568
02:10:41,016 --> 02:10:47,470
completely than they had yet seen it,
and presently it so raged that the women

2569
02:10:47,470 --> 02:10:50,896
called in stronger arms to hold him
down.

2570
02:10:50,896 --> 02:10:53,536
There were times when he broke out in the
language of the roundup,

2571
02:10:53,536 --> 02:10:56,072
and Mrs. Taylor renewed her protests.

2572
02:10:56,072 --> 02:11:02,127
“Why,” said Molly, “don’t you suppose I
knew they could swear?”

2573
02:11:02,127 --> 02:11:06,935
So the dame, in deepening astonishment
and affection, gave up

2574
02:11:06,935 --> 02:11:09,528
these shifts at decorum.

2575
02:11:09,528 --> 02:11:13,964
Nor did the delirium run into the
intimate, coarse matters

2576
02:11:13,964 --> 02:11:15,413
that she dreaded.

2577
02:11:15,413 --> 02:11:20,803
The cowpuncher had lived like his kind,
but his natural daily thoughts were

2578
02:11:20,803 --> 02:11:26,103
clean, and came from the untamed but
unstained mind of a man.

2579
02:11:26,103 --> 02:11:31,384
And toward morning, as Mrs. Taylor sat
taking her turn, suddenly he asked had

2580
02:11:31,384 --> 02:11:34,822
he been sick long, and looked at her
with a quieted eye.

2581
02:11:34,822 --> 02:11:39,023
The wandering seemed to drop from him at
a stroke, leaving him altogether

2582
02:11:39,023 --> 02:11:39,903
himself.

2583
02:11:39,903 --> 02:11:45,855
He lay very feeble, and inquired once or
twice of his state and how he came here;

2584
02:11:45,855 --> 02:11:50,255
nor was anything left in his memory of
even coming to the spring where

2585
02:11:50,255 --> 02:11:51,509
he had been found.

2586
02:11:51,509 --> 02:11:55,656
When the doctor arrived,
he pronounced that it would be

2587
02:11:55,656 --> 02:11:58,742
long⁠—or very short.

2588
02:11:58,742 --> 02:12:03,629
He praised their clean water treatment;
the wound was fortunately well up on the

2589
02:12:03,629 --> 02:12:09,401
shoulder, and gave so far no bad signs;
there were not any bad signs;

2590
02:12:09,401 --> 02:12:14,195
and the blood and strength of the
patient had been as few men’s were;

2591
02:12:14,195 --> 02:12:18,426
each hour was now an hour nearer
certainty, and meanwhile⁠—meanwhile the

2592
02:12:18,426 --> 02:12:20,774
doctor would remain as long as he could.

2593
02:12:20,774 --> 02:12:23,176
He had many inquiries to satisfy.

2594
02:12:23,176 --> 02:12:26,666
Dusty fellows would ride up,
listen to him, and reply,

2595
02:12:26,666 --> 02:12:29,726
as they rode away, “Don’t yu’
let him die, Doc.”

2596
02:12:29,726 --> 02:12:34,806
And Judge Henry sent over from Sunk Creek
to answer for any attendance or medicine

2597
02:12:34,806 --> 02:12:36,255
that might help his foreman.

2598
02:12:36,255 --> 02:12:41,188
The country was moved with concern and
interest; and in Molly’s ears its words

2599
02:12:41,188 --> 02:12:45,739
of good feeling seemed to unite and sum
up a burden, “Don’t yu’

2600
02:12:45,739 --> 02:12:47,050
let him die, Doc.”

2601
02:12:47,050 --> 02:12:50,512
The Indians who had done this were
now in military custody.

2602
02:12:50,512 --> 02:12:55,384
They had come unpermitted from a southern
reservation, hunting,

2603
02:12:55,384 --> 02:13:01,635
next thieving, and as the slumbering
spirit roused in one or two of the young

2604
02:13:01,635 --> 02:13:04,634
and ambitious, they had ventured this in
the secret mountains,

2605
02:13:04,634 --> 02:13:06,314
and perhaps had killed
a trapper found there.

2606
02:13:06,314 --> 02:13:09,745
Editors immediately reared a tall war out
of it; but from five Indians in a

2607
02:13:09,745 --> 02:13:14,912
guardhouse waiting punishment not even
an editor can supply spar for more than

2608
02:13:14,912 --> 02:13:21,711
two editions, and if the recent alarm
was still a matter of talk anywhere,

2609
02:13:21,711 --> 02:13:26,369
it was not here in the sickroom.

2610
02:13:26,369 --> 02:13:30,880
Whichever way the case should turn,
it was through Molly alone (the doctor

2611
02:13:30,880 --> 02:13:35,394
told her) that the wounded man had got
this chance⁠—this good

2612
02:13:35,394 --> 02:13:37,055
chance, he related.

2613
02:13:37,055 --> 02:13:41,047
And he told her she had not done a
woman’s part, but a man’s part,

2614
02:13:41,047 --> 02:13:45,007
and now had no more to do;
no more till the patient got well,

2615
02:13:45,007 --> 02:13:48,520
and could thank her in his own way,
said the doctor, smiling,

2616
02:13:48,520 --> 02:13:57,796
and supposing things that were not so⁠—
misled perhaps by Mrs. Taylor.

2617
02:13:57,796 --> 02:14:02,389
“I’m afraid I’ll be gone by the time he
is well,” said Molly,

2618
02:14:02,389 --> 02:14:06,589
coldly; and the discreet physician said
ah, and that she would find Bennington

2619
02:14:06,589 --> 02:14:08,329
quite a change from Bear Creek.

2620
02:14:08,329 --> 02:14:12,480
But Mrs. Taylor spoke otherwise,
and at that the girl said:

2621
02:14:12,480 --> 02:14:14,719
“I shall stay as long as I am needed.

2622
02:14:14,719 --> 02:14:15,985
I will nurse him.

2623
02:14:15,985 --> 02:14:17,360
I want to nurse him.

2624
02:14:17,360 --> 02:14:20,250
I will do everything for him that I can!”

2625
02:14:20,250 --> 02:14:21,920
she exclaimed, with force.

2626
02:14:21,920 --> 02:14:25,650
“And that won’t be anything,
deary,” said Mrs. Taylor, harshly.

2627
02:14:25,650 --> 02:14:30,996
“A year of nursing don’t equal
a day of sweetheart.”

2628
02:14:30,996 --> 02:14:35,819
The girl took a walk⁠—she was of no more
service in the room at present⁠—but she

2629
02:14:35,819 --> 02:14:40,696
turned without going far,
and Mrs. Taylor spied her come to lean

2630
02:14:40,696 --> 02:14:48,671
over the pasture fence and watch the two
horses⁠—that one the Virginian had

2631
02:14:48,671 --> 02:14:51,337
“gentled” for her, and his own Monte.

2632
02:14:51,337 --> 02:14:55,897
During this suspense came a new call for
the doctor, neighbors profiting by his

2633
02:14:55,897 --> 02:14:59,352
visit to Bear Creek;
and in his going away to them,

2634
02:14:59,352 --> 02:15:04,064
even under promise of quick return,
Mrs. Taylor suspected a favorable sign.

2635
02:15:04,064 --> 02:15:10,272
He kept his word as punctually as had
been possible, arriving after some six

2636
02:15:10,272 --> 02:15:16,057
hours with a confident face,
and spending now upon the patient a care

2637
02:15:16,057 --> 02:15:19,685
not needed, save to reassure
the bystanders.

2638
02:15:19,685 --> 02:15:23,609
He spoke his opinion that all was even
better than he could have hoped it

2639
02:15:23,609 --> 02:15:25,314
would be, so soon.

2640
02:15:25,314 --> 02:15:28,929
Here was now the beginning of the fifth
day; the wound’s look was wholesome,

2641
02:15:28,929 --> 02:15:33,722
no further delirium had come,
and the fever had abated a degree

2642
02:15:33,722 --> 02:15:35,714
while he was absent.

2643
02:15:35,714 --> 02:15:41,820
He believed the serious danger-line lay
behind, and (short of the unforeseen)

2644
02:15:41,820 --> 02:15:46,754
the man’s deep untainted strength
would reassert its control.

2645
02:15:46,754 --> 02:15:50,421
He had much blood to make,
and must be cared for during weeks⁠—

2646
02:15:50,421 --> 02:15:54,899
three, four, five⁠—there was no
saying how long yet.

2647
02:15:54,899 --> 02:16:00,141
These next few days it must be utter
quiet for him; he must not talk nor hear

2648
02:16:00,141 --> 02:16:04,333
anything likely to disturb him;
and then the time for cheerfulness and

2649
02:16:04,333 --> 02:16:09,618
gradual company would come⁠—sooner than
later, the doctor hoped.

2650
02:16:09,618 --> 02:16:15,069
So he departed, and sent next day some
bottles, with further cautions regarding

2651
02:16:15,069 --> 02:16:20,672
the wound and dirt, and to say he should
be calling the day after tomorrow.

2652
02:16:20,672 --> 02:16:24,847
Upon that occasion he found two patients.

2653
02:16:24,847 --> 02:16:31,307
Molly Wood lay in bed at Mrs. Taylor’s,
filled with apology and indignation.

2654
02:16:31,307 --> 02:16:35,813
With little to do, and deprived of the
strong stimulant of anxiety and action,

2655
02:16:35,813 --> 02:16:39,610
her strength had quite suddenly left
her, so that she had spoken only in

2656
02:16:39,610 --> 02:16:40,971
a sort of whisper.

2657
02:16:40,971 --> 02:16:47,076
But upon waking from a long sleep,
after Mrs. Taylor had taken her firmly,

2658
02:16:47,076 --> 02:16:51,189
almost severely, in hand,
her natural voice had returned,

2659
02:16:51,189 --> 02:16:55,431
and now the chief treatment the doctor
gave her was a sort of scolding,

2660
02:16:55,431 --> 02:16:58,553
which it pleased Mrs. Taylor to hear.

2661
02:16:58,553 --> 02:17:01,984
The doctor even dropped a phrase
concerning the arrogance of strong

2662
02:17:01,984 --> 02:17:06,054
nerves in slender bodies,
and of undertaking several people’s work

2663
02:17:06,054 --> 02:17:10,831
when several people were at hand to do
it for themselves, and this

2664
02:17:10,831 --> 02:17:14,424
pleased Mrs. Taylor remarkably.

2665
02:17:14,424 --> 02:17:18,093
As for the wounded man,
he was behaving himself properly.

2666
02:17:18,093 --> 02:17:21,744
Perhaps in another week he could be moved
to a more cheerful room.

2667
02:17:21,744 --> 02:17:25,947
Just now, with cleanliness and pure air,
any barn would do.

2668
02:17:25,947 --> 02:17:30,246
“We are real lucky to have such a
sensible doctor in the country,”

2669
02:17:30,246 --> 02:17:33,518
Mrs. Taylor observed,
after the physician had gone.

2670
02:17:33,518 --> 02:17:35,898
“No doubt,” said Molly.

2671
02:17:35,898 --> 02:17:37,861
“He said my room was a barn.”

2672
02:17:37,861 --> 02:17:39,968
“That’s what you’ve made it, deary.

2673
02:17:39,968 --> -1:59:59,000
But sick men don’t notice much.

2674
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

2675
02:17:43,399 --> 02:17:48,710
Nevertheless, one may believe,
without going widely astray,

2676
02:17:48,710 --> 02:17:53,817
that illness, so far from veiling,
more often quickens the perceptions⁠—at

2677
02:17:53,817 --> 02:17:56,957
any rate those of the naturally keen.

2678
02:17:56,957 --> 02:18:01,298
On a later day⁠—and the interval was
brief⁠—while Molly was on her second

2679
02:18:01,298 --> 02:18:05,080
drive to take the air with Mrs. Taylor,
that lady informed her that the

2680
02:18:05,080 --> 02:18:06,606
sick man had noticed.

2681
02:18:06,606 --> 02:18:08,996
“And I could not tell him things liable
to disturb him,” said she,

2682
02:18:08,996 --> 02:18:14,784
“and so I⁠—well, I expect I just didn’t
exactly tell him the facts.

2683
02:18:14,784 --> 02:18:18,417
I said yes, you were packing up for a
little visit to your folks.

2684
02:18:18,417 --> 02:18:21,435
They had not seen you for quite
a while, I said.

2685
02:18:21,435 --> 02:18:24,563
And he looked at those boxes
kind of silent like.”

2686
02:18:24,563 --> 02:18:27,285
“There’s no need to move him,” said Molly.

2687
02:18:27,285 --> 02:18:31,965
“It is simpler to move them⁠—the boxes.

2688
02:18:31,965 --> 02:18:35,071
I could take out some of my things,
you know, just while he has

2689
02:18:35,071 --> 02:18:36,024
to be kept there.

2690
02:18:36,024 --> 02:18:41,125
I mean⁠—you see, if the doctor says the
room should be cheerful⁠—”

2691
02:18:41,125 --> 02:18:42,594
“Yes, deary.”

2692
02:18:42,594 --> 02:18:48,333
“I will ask the doctor next time,”
said Molly, “if he believes I am⁠—

2693
02:18:48,333 --> 02:18:51,143
competent to spread a rug upon a floor.”

2694
02:18:51,143 --> 02:18:54,874
Molly’s references to the doctor were
usually acid these days.

2695
02:18:54,874 --> 02:18:59,765
And this he totally failed to observe,
telling her when he came,

2696
02:18:59,765 --> 02:19:01,789
why, to be sure!

2697
02:19:01,789 --> 02:19:02,970
the very thing!

2698
02:19:02,970 --> 02:19:07,370
And if she could play cards or read
aloud, or afford any other light

2699
02:19:07,370 --> 02:19:11,972
distractions, provided they did not lead
the patient to talk and tire himself,

2700
02:19:11,972 --> 02:19:13,557
that she would be most useful.

2701
02:19:13,557 --> 02:19:18,334
Accordingly she took over the cribbage
board, and came with unexpected

2702
02:19:18,334 --> 02:19:26,337
hesitation face to face again with the
swarthy man she had saved and tended.

2703
02:19:26,337 --> 02:19:30,167
He was not so swarthy now,
but neat, with chin clean,

2704
02:19:30,167 --> 02:19:33,927
and hair and mustache trimmed and
smooth, and he sat propped among

2705
02:19:33,927 --> 02:19:35,647
pillows watching for her.

2706
02:19:35,647 --> 02:19:39,818
“You are better,” she said,
speaking first, and with uncertain

2707
02:19:39,818 --> 02:19:40,675
voice.

2708
02:19:40,675 --> 02:19:41,680
“Yes.

2709
02:19:41,680 --> 02:19:45,769
They have given me awdehs not to talk,”
said the Southerner, smiling.

2710
02:19:45,769 --> 02:19:47,452
“Oh, yes.

2711
02:19:47,452 --> -1:59:59,000
Please do not talk⁠—not today

2712
-1:59:59,000 --> -1:59:59,000
.

2713
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

2714
02:19:52,974 --> 02:19:54,235
“No.

2715
02:19:54,235 --> 02:20:03,314
Only this”⁠—he looked at her,
and saw her seem to shrink⁠—“thank you

2716
02:20:03,314 --> 02:20:06,279
for what you have done,” he said simply.

2717
02:20:06,279 --> 02:20:10,969
She took tenderly the hand he stretched
to her; and upon these terms they set

2718
02:20:10,969 --> 02:20:12,886
to work at cribbage.

2719
02:20:12,886 --> 02:20:17,711
She won, and won again,
and the third time laid down her cards

2720
02:20:17,711 --> -1:59:59,000
and reproached him with playing
in order to lose.

2721
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
“

2722
02:20:20,747 --> 02:20:26,279
No,” he said, and his eye
wandered to the boxes.

2723
02:20:26,279 --> 02:20:30,040
“But my thoughts get away from me.

2724
02:20:30,040 --> -1:59:59,000
I’ll be strong enough to hold them on the
cyards next time, I reckon.

2725
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

2726
02:20:33,679 --> 02:20:37,071
Many tones in his voice she had heard,
but never the tone of

2727
02:20:37,071 --> 02:20:38,975
sadness until today.

2728
02:20:38,975 --> 02:20:41,951
Then they played a little more,
and she put away the board

2729
02:20:41,951 --> 02:20:43,272
for this first time.

2730
02:20:43,272 --> 02:20:45,457
“You are going now?”

2731
02:20:45,457 --> 02:20:46,206
he asked.

2732
02:20:46,206 --> 02:20:50,146
“When I have made this room look
a little less forlorn.

2733
02:20:50,146 --> 02:20:53,446
They haven’t wanted to meddle with
my things, I suppose.”

2734
02:20:53,446 --> 02:20:59,069
And Molly stooped once again among the
chattels destined for Vermont.

2735
02:20:59,069 --> 02:21:03,424
Out they came; again the bearskin was
spread on the floor,

2736
02:21:03,424 --> 02:21:07,244
various possessions and ornaments went
back into their ancient niches,

2737
02:21:07,244 --> 02:21:11,468
the shelves grew comfortable with books,
and, last, some flowers were

2738
02:21:11,468 --> 02:21:12,428
stood on the table.

2739
02:21:12,428 --> 02:21:16,665
“More like old times,”
said the Virginian, but sadly.

2740
02:21:16,665 --> 02:21:20,568
“It’s too bad,” said Molly,
“you had to be brought into

2741
02:21:20,568 --> -1:59:59,000
such a looking place.

2742
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

2743
02:21:22,179 --> 02:21:24,763
“And your folks waiting for you,” said he.

2744
02:21:24,763 --> 02:21:28,552
“Oh, I’ll pay my visit later,”
said Molly, putting the

2745
02:21:28,552 --> 02:21:30,032
rug a trifle straighter.

2746
02:21:30,032 --> 02:21:32,428
“May I ask one thing?”

2747
02:21:32,428 --> 02:21:36,191
pleaded the Virginian,
and at the gentleness of his voice her

2748
02:21:36,191 --> 02:21:40,801
face grew rosy, and she fixed her eyes
on him with a sort of dread.

2749
02:21:40,801 --> 02:21:43,624
“Anything that I can answer,” said she.

2750
02:21:43,624 --> 02:21:45,137
“Oh, yes.

2751
02:21:45,137 --> 02:21:49,309
Did I tell yu’ to quit me,
and did yu’ load up my gun and stay?

2752
02:21:49,309 --> 02:21:50,937
Was that a real business?

2753
02:21:50,937 --> 02:21:52,814
I have been mixed up in my haid.”

2754
02:21:52,814 --> 02:21:54,712
“That was real,” said Molly.

2755
02:21:54,712 --> 02:21:56,373
“What else was there to do?”

2756
02:21:56,373 --> 02:21:58,407
“Just nothing⁠—for such as you!”

2757
02:21:58,407 --> 02:21:59,173
he exclaimed.

2758
02:21:59,173 --> 02:22:03,453
“My haid has been mighty crazy;
and that little grandmother of yours

2759
02:22:03,453 --> 02:22:08,253
yondeh, she⁠—but I can’t just quite
catch ahold of these things”⁠—he passed

2760
02:22:08,253 --> 02:22:13,817
a hand over his forehead⁠—“so many⁠—or
else one right along⁠—

2761
02:22:13,817 --> 02:22:16,425
well, it’s all foolishness!”

2762
02:22:16,425 --> 02:22:20,220
he concluded, with something almost
savage in his tone.

2763
02:22:20,220 --> 02:22:24,380
And after she had gone from the cabin he
lay very still, looking at the

2764
02:22:24,380 --> 02:22:25,651
miniature on the wall.

2765
02:22:25,651 --> 02:22:29,580
He was in another sort of mood the next
time, cribbage not interesting

2766
02:22:29,580 --> 02:22:31,031
him in the least.

2767
02:22:31,031 --> 02:22:34,831
“Your folks will be wondering
about you,” said he.

2768
02:22:34,831 --> 02:22:39,134
“I don’t think they will mind which month
I go to them,” said Molly.

2769
02:22:39,134 --> -1:59:59,000
“Especially when they know the reason

2770
-1:59:59,000 --> -1:59:59,000
.

2771
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

2772
02:22:41,390 --> 02:22:44,152
“Don’t let me keep you, ma’am,” said he.

2773
02:22:44,152 --> 02:22:49,092
Molly stared at him; but he pursued,
with the same edge lurking in his slow

2774
02:22:49,092 --> 02:22:51,728
words: “Though I’ll never forget.

2775
02:22:51,728 --> 02:22:55,063
How could I forget any of all you
have done⁠—and been?

2776
02:22:55,063 --> 02:23:00,155
If there had been none of this,
why, I had enough to remember!

2777
02:23:00,155 --> 02:23:01,890
But please don’t stay, ma’am.

2778
02:23:01,890 --> 02:23:06,067
We’ll say I had a claim when yu’ found me
pretty well dead, but I’m gettin’ well,

2779
02:23:06,067 --> 02:23:07,905
yu’ see⁠—right smart, too!”

2780
02:23:07,905 --> 02:23:13,714
“I can’t understand, indeed I can’t,”
said Molly, “why you’re talking so!”

2781
02:23:13,714 --> 02:23:17,890
He seemed to have certain moods when he
would address her as “ma’am,”

2782
02:23:17,890 --> 02:23:20,658
and this she did not like,
but could not prevent.

2783
02:23:20,658 --> 02:23:23,651
“Oh, a sick man is funny.

2784
02:23:23,651 --> 02:23:25,255
And yu’ know I’m grateful to you.”

2785
02:23:25,255 --> 02:23:28,293
“Please say no more about that,
or I shall go this afternoon.

2786
02:23:28,293 --> 02:23:29,674
I don’t want to go.

2787
02:23:29,674 --> 02:23:30,762
I am not ready.

2788
02:23:30,762 --> 02:23:32,972
I think I had better read something now.”

2789
02:23:32,972 --> 02:23:34,175
“Why, yes.

2790
02:23:34,175 --> 02:23:36,643
That’s cert’nly a good notion.

2791
02:23:36,643 --> 02:23:40,375
Why, this is the best show you’ll ever
get to give me education.

2792
02:23:40,375 --> 02:23:43,055
Won’t yu’ please try that
Emma book now, ma’am?

2793
02:23:43,055 --> 02:23:45,335
Listening to you will be different.”

2794
02:23:45,335 --> 02:23:49,800
This was said with softness and humility.

2795
02:23:49,800 --> 02:23:56,040
Uncertain⁠—as his gravity often left
her⁠—precisely what he meant by what he

2796
02:23:56,040 --> 02:24:01,155
said, Molly proceeded with Emma,
slackly at first, but soon with the

2797
02:24:01,155 --> 02:24:04,352
enthusiasm that Miss
Austen invariably gave her.

2798
02:24:04,352 --> 02:24:09,386
She held the volume and read away at it,
commenting briefly, and then,

2799
02:24:09,386 --> 02:24:13,203
finishing a chapter of the sprightly
classic, found her pupil

2800
02:24:13,203 --> 02:24:14,737
slumbering peacefully.

2801
02:24:14,737 --> 02:24:16,845
There was no uncertainty about that.

2802
02:24:16,845 --> 02:24:21,044
“You couldn’t be doing a healthier thing
for him, deary,” said Mrs. Taylor.

2803
02:24:21,044 --> 02:24:24,764
“If it gets to make him
wakeful, try something harder.”

2804
02:24:24,764 --> 02:24:29,185
This was the lady’s scarcely
sympathetic view.

2805
02:24:29,185 --> 02:24:33,665
But it turned out to be not obscurity in
which Miss Austen sinned.

2806
02:24:33,665 --> 02:24:37,388
When Molly next appeared at the
Virginian’s threshold,

2807
02:24:37,388 --> 02:24:40,141
he said plaintively,
“I reckon I am a dunce.”

2808
02:24:40,141 --> 02:24:41,724
And he sued for pardon.

2809
02:24:41,724 --> 02:24:44,838
“When I waked up,” he said,
“I was ashamed of myself for

2810
02:24:44,838 --> 02:24:46,085
a plumb half-hour.”

2811
02:24:46,085 --> 02:24:48,869
Nor could she doubt this day that he
meant what he said.

2812
02:24:48,869 --> 02:24:53,749
His mood was again serene and gentle,
and without referring to his singular

2813
02:24:53,749 --> 02:24:58,496
words that had distressed her,
he made her feel his contrition,

2814
02:24:58,496 --> 02:24:59,889
even in his silence.

2815
02:24:59,889 --> 02:25:02,329
“I am right glad you have come,” he said.

2816
02:25:02,329 --> 02:25:06,853
And as he saw her going to the bookshelf,
he continued, with diffidence:

2817
02:25:06,853 --> 02:25:14,372
“As regyards that Emma book,
yu’ see⁠—yu’ see, the doin’s and sayin’s

2818
02:25:14,372 --> 02:25:16,012
of folks like them are above me.

2819
02:25:16,012 --> 02:25:21,134
But I think” (he spoke most diffidently),
“if yu’ could read me something that was

2820
02:25:21,134 --> 02:25:25,054
about something, I⁠—I’d be
liable to keep awake.”

2821
02:25:25,054 --> 02:25:27,435
And he smiled with a certain shyness.

2822
02:25:27,435 --> 02:25:29,317
“Something about something?”

2823
02:25:29,317 --> 02:25:31,276
queried Molly, at a loss.

2824
02:25:31,276 --> 02:25:32,747
“Why, yes.

2825
02:25:32,747 --> 02:25:34,038
Shakespeare.

2826
02:25:34,038 --> 02:25:35,427
Henry the Fourth.

2827
02:25:35,427 --> 02:25:42,740
The British king is fighting,
and there is his son the prince.

2828
02:25:42,740 --> 02:25:46,574
He cert’nly must have been a jim-dandy
boy if that is all true.

2829
02:25:46,574 --> 02:25:50,149
Only he would go around town with
a mighty triflin’ gang.

2830
02:25:50,149 --> 02:25:53,902
They sported and they held up citizens.

2831
02:25:53,902 --> 02:25:58,946
And his father hated his travelling
with trash like them.

2832
02:25:58,946 --> 02:26:03,372
It was right natural⁠—the boy
and the old man!

2833
02:26:03,372 --> 02:26:06,679
But the boy showed himself a man too.

2834
02:26:06,679 --> 02:26:10,795
He killed a big fighter on the other side
who was another jim-dandy⁠—and he was

2835
02:26:10,795 --> 02:26:12,595
sorry for having it to do.”

2836
02:26:12,595 --> 02:26:14,795
The Virginian warmed to his recital.

2837
02:26:14,795 --> 02:26:17,865
“I understand most all of that.

2838
02:26:17,865 --> 02:26:20,830
There was a fat man kept
everybody laughing.

2839
02:26:20,830 --> 02:26:24,819
He was awful natural too;
except yu’ don’t commonly

2840
02:26:24,819 --> 02:26:26,476
meet ’em so fat.

2841
02:26:26,476 --> 02:26:29,764
But the prince⁠—that play
is bedrock, ma’am!

2842
02:26:29,764 --> 02:26:31,430
Have you got something like that?”

2843
02:26:31,430 --> 02:26:34,870
“Yes, I think so,” she replied.

2844
02:26:34,870 --> 02:26:37,013
“I believe I see what
you would appreciate.”

2845
02:26:37,013 --> 02:26:41,045
She took her Browning,
her idol, her imagined affinity.

2846
02:26:41,045 --> 02:26:45,178
For the pale decadence of New England had
somewhat watered her good old

2847
02:26:45,178 --> 02:26:48,457
Revolutionary blood too,
and she was inclined to think under

2848
02:26:48,457 --> 02:26:52,783
glass and to live underdone⁠—when there
were no Indians to shoot!

2849
02:26:52,783 --> 02:26:56,199
She would have joyed to venture
Paracelsus on him, and some lengthy

2850
02:26:56,199 --> 02:27:01,606
rhymed discourses; and she fondly turned
leaves and leaves of

2851
02:27:01,606 --> 02:27:03,335
her pet doggerel analytics.

2852
02:27:03,335 --> 02:27:08,369
Pippa Passes and others she had to skip,
from discreet motives⁠—pages which he

2853
02:27:08,369 --> 02:27:12,120
would have doubtless stayed awake at;
but she chose a poem at length.

2854
02:27:12,120 --> 02:27:16,174
This was better than Emma, he pronounced.

2855
02:27:16,174 --> 02:27:17,113
And short.

2856
02:27:17,113 --> 02:27:18,930
The horse was a good horse.

2857
02:27:18,930 --> 02:27:22,455
He thought a man whose horse must not
play out on him would watch the ground

2858
02:27:22,455 --> 02:27:25,975
he was galloping over for holes,
and not be likely to see what color the

2859
02:27:25,975 --> 02:27:28,318
rims of his animal’s eye-sockets were.

2860
02:27:28,318 --> 02:27:32,985
You could not see them if you sat as you
ought to for such a hard ride.

2861
02:27:32,985 --> 02:27:36,678
Of the next piece that she read him
he thought still better.

2862
02:27:36,678 --> 02:27:38,896
“And it is short,” said he.

2863
02:27:38,896 --> 02:27:40,759
“But the last part drops.”

2864
02:27:40,759 --> 02:27:43,361
Molly instantly exacted particulars.

2865
02:27:43,361 --> 02:27:46,601
“The soldier should not have told the
general he was killed,”

2866
02:27:46,601 --> 02:27:47,921
stated the cowpuncher.

2867
02:27:47,921 --> 02:27:50,921
“What should he have told him,
I’d like to know?”

2868
02:27:50,921 --> 02:27:51,981
said Molly.

2869
02:27:51,981 --> 02:27:54,021
“Why, just nothing.

2870
02:27:54,021 --> 02:27:58,903
If the soldier could ride out of the
battle all shot up, and tell his general

2871
02:27:58,903 --> 02:28:02,011
about their takin’ the town⁠—that was
being gritty, yu’ see.

2872
02:28:02,011 --> 02:28:04,903
But that truck at the finish⁠—will yu’
please say it again?”

2873
02:28:04,903 --> 02:28:06,701
So Molly read:⁠—

2874
02:28:06,701 --> 02:28:09,364
“ ‘You’re wounded!

2875
02:28:09,364 --> 02:28:14,298
‘Nay,’ the soldier’s prideTouched to the
quick, he said,‘I’m killed, sire!’

2876
02:28:14,298 --> -1:59:59,000
And, his chief beside,
Smiling the boy fell dead.

2877
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

2878
02:28:18,533 --> 02:28:22,483
“ ‘Nay, I’m killed, sire,’
” drawled the Virginian,

2879
02:28:22,483 --> 02:28:33,263
amiably; for (symptom of convalescence)
his freakish irony was revived in him.

2880
02:28:33,263 --> 02:28:39,222
“Now a man who was man enough to act like
he did, yu’ see, would fall

2881
02:28:39,222 --> 02:28:40,916
dead without mentioning it.”

2882
02:28:40,916 --> 02:28:46,590
None of Molly’s sweet girl friends had
ever thus challenged Mr. Browning.

2883
02:28:46,590 --> 02:28:50,807
They had been wont to cluster over him
with a joyous awe that deepened

2884
02:28:50,807 --> 02:28:53,397
proportionally with their
misunderstanding.

2885
02:28:53,397 --> 02:28:57,488
Molly paused to consider this novelty of
view about the soldier.

2886
02:28:57,488 --> 02:29:01,648
“He was a Frenchman, you know,”
she said, under inspiration.

2887
02:29:01,648 --> 02:29:04,701
“A Frenchman,” murmured
the grave cowpuncher.

2888
02:29:04,701 --> 02:29:08,648
“I never knowed a Frenchman,
but I reckon they might perform

2889
02:29:08,648 --> -1:59:59,000
that class of foolishness.

2890
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

2891
02:29:10,992 --> 02:29:13,080
“But why was it foolish?”

2892
02:29:13,080 --> 02:29:13,871
she cried.

2893
02:29:13,871 --> 02:29:16,048
“His soldier’s pride⁠—don’t you see?”

2894
02:29:16,048 --> 02:29:16,677
“No.”

2895
02:29:16,677 --> 02:29:19,812
Molly now burst into a
luxury of discussion.

2896
02:29:19,812 --> 02:29:23,847
She leaned toward her cowpuncher with
bright eyes searching his;

2897
02:29:23,847 --> 02:29:30,112
with elbow on knee and hand propping
chin, her lap became a slant,

2898
02:29:30,112 --> 02:29:34,720
and from it Browning the poet slid and
toppled, and lay unrescued.

2899
02:29:34,720 --> 02:29:40,724
For the slow cowpuncher unfolded his
notions of masculine courage and modesty

2900
02:29:40,724 --> 02:29:45,056
(though he did not deal in such high-
sounding names), and Molly forgot

2901
02:29:45,056 --> 02:29:49,293
everything to listen to him,
as he forgot himself and his inveterate

2902
02:29:49,293 --> 02:29:55,010
shyness and grew talkative to her.

2903
02:29:55,010 --> 02:29:58,604
“I would never have supposed that!”

2904
02:29:58,604 --> 02:30:02,610
she would exclaim as she heard him;
or, presently again,

2905
02:30:02,610 --> 02:30:05,130
“I never had such an idea!”

2906
02:30:05,130 --> 02:30:10,633
And her mind opened with delight to these
new things which came from the man’s

2907
02:30:10,633 --> 02:30:13,827
mind so simple and direct.

2908
02:30:13,827 --> 02:30:18,645
To Browning they did come back,
but the Virginian, though interested,

2909
02:30:18,645 --> 02:30:20,712
conceived a dislike for him.

2910
02:30:20,712 --> 02:30:24,168
“He is a smarty,” said he, once or twice.

2911
02:30:24,168 --> 02:30:26,609
“Now here is something,” said Molly.

2912
02:30:26,609 --> 02:30:29,364
“I have never known what to think.”

2913
02:30:29,364 --> 02:30:31,709
“Oh, Heavens!”

2914
02:30:31,709 --> 02:30:33,597
murmured the sick man, smiling.

2915
02:30:33,597 --> 02:30:34,749
“Is it short?”

2916
02:30:34,749 --> 02:30:36,881
“Very short.

2917
02:30:36,881 --> 02:30:38,163
Now please attend.”

2918
02:30:38,163 --> 02:30:42,498
And she read him twelve lines about a
lover who rowed to a beach in the dusk,

2919
02:30:42,498 --> 02:30:46,212
crossed a field, tapped at a
pane, and was admitted.

2920
02:30:46,212 --> 02:30:49,020
“That is the best yet,”
said the Virginian.

2921
02:30:49,020 --> 02:30:51,383
“There’s only one thing yu’
can think about that.”

2922
02:30:51,383 --> 02:30:53,611
“But wait,” said the girl, swiftly.

2923
02:30:53,611 --> 02:30:55,160
“Here is how they parted:⁠—

2924
02:30:55,160 --> 02:30:59,063
“Round the cape of a sudden came the sea,
And the sun looked over the mountain’s

2925
02:30:59,063 --> 02:31:02,783
rim⁠—And straight was a path of gold for
him,And the need of a world

2926
02:31:02,783 --> 02:31:03,863
of men for me.”

2927
02:31:03,863 --> 02:31:07,532
“That is very, very true,”
murmured the Virginian,

2928
02:31:07,532 --> 02:31:10,463
dropping his eyes from
the girl’s intent ones.

2929
02:31:10,463 --> 02:31:11,700
“Had they quarrelled?”

2930
02:31:11,700 --> 02:31:12,843
she inquired.

2931
02:31:12,843 --> 02:31:13,508
“Oh, no!”

2932
02:31:13,508 --> 02:31:13,999
“But⁠—”

2933
02:31:13,999 --> 02:31:15,399
“I reckon he loved her very much.”

2934
02:31:15,399 --> 02:31:17,161
“Then you’re sure they hadn’t quarrelled?”

2935
02:31:17,161 --> 02:31:18,306
“Dead sure, ma’am.

2936
02:31:18,306 --> 02:31:21,846
He would come back afteh he had played
some more of the game.”

2937
02:31:21,846 --> 02:31:22,699
“The game?”

2938
02:31:22,699 --> 02:31:24,311
“Life, ma’am.

2939
02:31:24,311 --> 02:31:26,780
Whatever he was a-doin’ in
the world of men.

2940
02:31:26,780 --> -1:59:59,000
That’s a bedrock piece, ma’am!

2941
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

2942
02:31:28,820 --> 02:31:33,080
“Well, I don’t see why you think it’s so
much better than some of the others.”

2943
02:31:33,080 --> 02:31:36,684
“I could sca’cely explain,”
answered the man.

2944
02:31:36,684 --> 02:31:39,102
“But that writer does know something.”

2945
02:31:39,102 --> 02:31:42,663
“I am glad they hadn’t
quarrelled,” said Molly, thoughtfully.

2946
02:31:42,663 --> 02:31:46,306
And she began to like
having her opinions refuted.

2947
02:31:46,306 --> 02:31:52,180
His bandages, becoming a little irksome,
had to be shifted, and this turned their

2948
02:31:52,180 --> 02:31:56,060
discourse from literature to Wyoming;
and Molly inquired, had he

2949
02:31:56,060 --> 02:31:57,539
ever been shot before?

2950
02:31:57,539 --> 02:31:59,747
Only once, he told her.

2951
02:31:59,747 --> 02:32:04,880
“I have been lucky in having
few fusses,” said he.

2952
02:32:04,880 --> 02:32:09,276
“I hate them.

2953
02:32:09,276 --> 02:32:11,916
If a man has to be killed⁠—”

2954
02:32:11,916 --> 02:32:13,885
“You never⁠—” broke in Molly.

2955
02:32:13,885 --> 02:32:17,065
She had started back a little.

2956
02:32:17,065 --> 02:32:21,397
“Well,” she added hastily,
“don’t tell me if⁠—”

2957
02:32:21,397 --> 02:32:25,461
“I shouldn’t wonder if I got one of those
Indians,” he said quietly.

2958
02:32:25,461 --> 02:32:28,685
“But I wasn’t waitin’ to see!

2959
02:32:28,685 --> 02:32:32,131
But I came mighty near doing for a
white man that day.

2960
02:32:32,131 --> -1:59:59,000
He had been hurtin’ a hawss.

2961
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

2962
02:32:34,785 --> 02:32:35,594
“Hurting?”

2963
02:32:35,594 --> 02:32:37,368
said Molly.

2964
02:32:37,368 --> 02:32:38,469
“Injurin.’

2965
02:32:38,469 --> 02:32:42,510
I will not tell yu’ about that.

2966
02:32:42,510 --> 02:32:44,809
It would hurt yu’ to hear such things.

2967
02:32:44,809 --> 02:32:47,582
But hawsses⁠—don’t they depend on us?

2968
02:32:47,582 --> -1:59:59,000
Ain’t they somethin’ like children

2969
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
?

2970
02:32:49,891 --> 02:32:53,064
I did not lay up the man very bad.

2971
02:32:53,064 --> 02:32:55,510
He was able to travel ’most right away.

2972
02:32:55,510 --> 02:32:57,655
Why, you’d have wanted
to kill him yourself!”

2973
02:32:57,655 --> 02:33:01,494
So the Virginian talked,
nor knew what he was doing to the girl.

2974
02:33:01,494 --> 02:33:05,774
Nor was she aware of what she was
receiving from him as he unwittingly

2975
02:33:05,774 --> 02:33:09,677
spoke himself out to her in these
Browning meetings they had each day.

2976
02:33:09,677 --> 02:33:11,882
But Mrs. Taylor grew pleased.

2977
02:33:11,882 --> 02:33:16,284
The kindly dame would sometimes cross the
road to see if she were needed,

2978
02:33:16,284 --> 02:33:19,978
and steal away again after a
peep at the window.

2979
02:33:19,978 --> 02:33:24,760
There, inside, among the restored home
treasures, sat the two:

2980
02:33:24,760 --> 02:33:30,139
the rosy alert girl,
sweet as she talked or read to him;

2981
02:33:30,139 --> 02:33:38,933
and he, the grave, half-weak giant among
his wraps, watching her.

2982
02:33:38,933 --> 02:33:44,003
Of her delayed home visit he never again
spoke, either to her or to Mrs. Taylor;

2983
02:33:44,003 --> 02:33:47,794
and Molly veered aside from any trend of
talk she foresaw was

2984
02:33:47,794 --> 02:33:49,514
leading toward that subject.

2985
02:33:49,514 --> 02:33:53,859
But in those hours when no visitors came,
and he was by himself in the quiet,

2986
02:33:53,859 --> 02:33:57,845
he would lie often sombrely
contemplating the girl’s room,

2987
02:33:57,845 --> 02:34:01,376
her little dainty knickknacks,
her home photographs,

2988
02:34:01,376 --> 02:34:06,572
all the delicate manifestations of what
she came from and what she was.

2989
02:34:06,572 --> 02:34:11,475
Strength was flowing back into him each
day, and Judge Henry’s latest messenger

2990
02:34:11,475 --> 02:34:15,667
had brought him clothes and mail from
Sunk Creek and many inquiries of

2991
02:34:15,667 --> 02:34:19,678
kindness, and returned taking the news
of the cowpuncher’s improvement,

2992
02:34:19,678 --> 02:34:24,619
and how soon he would be
permitted the fresh air.

2993
02:34:24,619 --> 02:34:30,899
Hence Molly found him waiting in a
flannel shirt of highly becoming shade,

2994
02:34:30,899 --> 02:34:35,500
and with a silk handkerchief knotted
round his throat; and he told her it was

2995
02:34:35,500 --> 02:34:37,569
good to feel respectable again.

2996
02:34:37,569 --> 02:34:41,651
She had come to read to him for the
allotted time; and she threw around his

2997
02:34:41,651 --> 02:34:48,213
shoulders the scarlet and black Navajo
blanket, striped with its

2998
02:34:48,213 --> 02:34:50,702
splendid zigzags of barbarity.

2999
02:34:50,702 --> 02:34:57,056
Thus he half sat, half leaned,
languid but at ease.

3000
02:34:57,056 --> 02:35:00,676
In his lap lay one of the letters brought
over by the messenger:

3001
02:35:00,676 --> 02:35:04,848
and though she was midway in a book that
engaged his full attention⁠—David

3002
02:35:04,848 --> 02:35:08,859
Copperfield⁠—his silence and absent look
this morning stopped her,

3003
02:35:08,859 --> 02:35:11,231
and she accused him of not attending.

3004
02:35:11,231 --> 02:35:14,648
“No,” he admitted; “I am
thinking of something else.”

3005
02:35:14,648 --> 02:35:17,248
She looked at him with that
apprehension which he knew.

3006
02:35:17,248 --> 02:35:19,728
“It had to come,” said he.

3007
02:35:19,728 --> 02:35:25,823
“And today I see my thoughts straighter
than I’ve been up to managing since⁠—

3008
02:35:25,823 --> 02:35:27,580
since my haid got clear.

3009
02:35:27,580 --> 02:35:31,940
And now I must say these thoughts⁠—if I
can, if I can!”

3010
02:35:31,940 --> 02:35:32,842
He stopped.

3011
02:35:32,842 --> 02:35:36,312
His eyes were intent upon her;
one hand was gripping the

3012
02:35:36,312 --> 02:35:37,632
arm of his chair.

3013
02:35:37,632 --> 02:35:40,254
“You promised⁠—” trembled Molly.

3014
02:35:40,254 --> 02:35:45,527
“I promised you should love
me,” he sternly interrupted.

3015
02:35:45,527 --> 02:35:47,905
“Promised that to myself.

3016
02:35:47,905 --> 02:35:50,057
I have broken that word.”

3017
02:35:50,057 --> 02:35:54,187
She shut David Copperfield
mechanically, and grew white.

3018
02:35:54,187 --> 02:35:59,709
“Your letter has come to me hyeh,”
he continued, gentle again.

3019
02:35:59,709 --> 02:36:01,726
“My⁠—” She had forgotten it.

3020
02:36:01,726 --> 02:36:05,830
“The letter you wrote to tell me goodbye.

3021
02:36:05,830 --> 02:36:09,960
You wrote it a little while ago⁠—not a
month yet, but it’s away and away

3022
02:36:09,960 --> -1:59:59,000
long gone for me.

3023
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

3024
02:36:11,828 --> 02:36:15,172
“I have never let you know⁠—” began Molly.

3025
02:36:15,172 --> 02:36:19,989
“The doctor,” he interrupted once more,
but very gently now,

3026
02:36:19,989 --> 02:36:23,002
“he gave awdehs I must be kept quiet.

3027
02:36:23,002 --> 02:36:25,516
I reckon yu’ thought tellin’ me might⁠—”

3028
02:36:25,516 --> 02:36:26,708
“Forgive me!”

3029
02:36:26,708 --> 02:36:27,858
cried the girl.

3030
02:36:27,858 --> 02:36:30,338
“Indeed I ought to have told you sooner!

3031
02:36:30,338 --> 02:36:32,093
Indeed I had no excuse!”

3032
02:36:32,093 --> 02:36:37,421
“Why, should yu’ tell me
if yu’ preferred not?

3033
02:36:37,421 --> 02:36:39,343
You had written.

3034
02:36:39,343 --> 02:36:44,505
And you speak” (he lifted the letter) “of
never being able to repay kindness;

3035
02:36:44,505 --> 02:36:46,699
but you have turned the tables.

3036
02:36:46,699 --> 02:36:49,508
I can never repay you by anything!

3037
02:36:49,508 --> 02:36:50,999
by anything!

3038
02:36:50,999 --> 02:36:55,183
So I had figured I would just jog back to
Sunk Creek and let you get away,

3039
02:36:55,183 --> 02:36:57,267
if you did not want to say
that kind of goodbye.

3040
02:36:57,267 --> 02:36:59,560
For I saw the boxes.

3041
02:36:59,560 --> 02:36:59,966
Mrs.

3042
02:36:59,966 --> 02:37:03,468
Taylor is too nice a woman to know the
trick of lyin’, and she

3043
02:37:03,468 --> 02:37:04,833
could not deceive me.

3044
02:37:04,833 --> 02:37:09,430
I have knowed yu’ were going away for
good ever since I saw those boxes.

3045
02:37:09,430 --> 02:37:14,357
But now hyeh comes your letter,
and it seems no way but I must speak.

3046
02:37:14,357 --> 02:37:16,850
I have thought a deal, lyin’ in this room.

3047
02:37:16,850 --> 02:37:20,523
And⁠—today⁠—I can say what I have thought.

3048
02:37:20,523 --> 02:37:21,977
I could not make you happy.”

3049
02:37:21,977 --> 02:37:23,822
He stopped, but she did not answer.

3050
02:37:23,822 --> 02:37:27,860
His voice had grown softer than
whispering, but yet was not a whisper.

3051
02:37:27,860 --> 02:37:33,629
From its quiet syllables she turned away,
blinded with sudden tears.

3052
02:37:33,629 --> 02:37:38,449
“Once, I thought love must surely
be enough,” he continued.

3053
02:37:38,449 --> 02:37:45,038
“And I thought if I could make you love
me, you could learn me to be less⁠—

3054
02:37:45,038 --> 02:37:48,574
less⁠—more your kind.

3055
02:37:48,574 --> 02:37:52,078
And I think I could give you a pretty
good sort of love.

3056
02:37:52,078 --> 02:37:58,501
But that don’t help the little mean pesky
things of day by day that make roughness

3057
02:37:58,501 --> 02:38:02,532
or smoothness for folks tied
together so awful close.

3058
02:38:02,532 --> 02:38:02,997
Mrs.

3059
02:38:02,997 --> 02:38:06,570
Taylor hyeh⁠—she don’t know anything
better than Taylor does.

3060
02:38:06,570 --> 02:38:09,325
She don’t want anything he can’t give her.

3061
02:38:09,325 --> 02:38:12,522
Her friends will do for him
and his for her.

3062
02:38:12,522 --> 02:38:15,958
And when I dreamed of you in my home⁠—”
he closed his eyes and

3063
02:38:15,958 --> 02:38:17,065
drew a long breath.

3064
02:38:17,065 --> 02:38:20,263
At last he looked at her again.

3065
02:38:20,263 --> 02:38:22,911
“This is no country for a lady.

3066
02:38:22,911 --> 02:38:26,342
Will yu’ forget and forgive the
bothering I have done?”

3067
02:38:26,342 --> 02:38:27,240
“Oh!”

3068
02:38:27,240 --> 02:38:28,183
cried Molly.

3069
02:38:28,183 --> 02:38:28,752
“Oh!”

3070
02:38:28,752 --> 02:38:31,082
And she put her hands to her eyes.

3071
02:38:31,082 --> 02:38:34,364
She had risen and stood
with her face covered.

3072
02:38:34,364 --> 02:38:37,325
“I surely had to tell you this
all out, didn’t I?”

3073
02:38:37,325 --> 02:38:40,648
said the cowpuncher, faintly,
in his chair.

3074
02:38:40,648 --> 02:38:41,215
“Oh!”

3075
02:38:41,215 --> 02:38:42,583
said Molly again.

3076
02:38:42,583 --> 02:38:46,142
“I have put it clear how
it is,” he pursued.

3077
02:38:46,142 --> 02:38:50,862
“I ought to have seen from the start I
was not the sort to keep you happy.”

3078
02:38:50,862 --> 02:38:56,133
“But,” said Molly⁠—“but I⁠—you ought⁠—
please try to keep me happy!”

3079
02:38:56,133 --> 02:38:59,716
And sinking by his chair,
she hid her face on his knees.

3080
02:38:59,716 --> 02:39:04,840
Speechless, he bent down and folded her
round, putting his hands on the hair

3081
02:39:04,840 --> 02:39:06,865
that had been always his delight.

3082
02:39:06,865 --> 02:39:08,126
Presently he whispered:⁠—

3083
02:39:08,126 --> 02:39:10,839
“You have beat me; how can I fight this?”

3084
02:39:10,839 --> 02:39:12,067
She answered nothing.

3085
02:39:12,067 --> 02:39:18,969
The Navajo’s scarlet and black
folds fell over both.

3086
02:39:18,969 --> 02:39:25,429
Not with words, not even with meeting
eyes, did the two plight their troth in

3087
02:39:25,429 --> 02:39:26,942
this first new hour.

3088
02:39:26,942 --> 02:39:33,339
So they remained long,
the fair head nesting in the great arms,

3089
02:39:33,339 --> 02:39:37,610
and the black head laid against it,
while over the silent room presided the

3090
02:39:37,610 --> 02:39:41,596
little Grandmother Stark in her frame,
rosy, blue, and flaxen,

3091
02:39:41,596 --> 02:39:44,700
not quite familiar, not quite smiling.

3092
02:39:44,700 --> 02:39:45,452
CHAPTER XXVIII

3093
02:39:45,452 --> 02:39:46,239
No Dream to Wake from

3094
02:39:46,239 --> 02:39:52,069
For a long while after she had left him,
he lay still, stretched in his chair.

3095
02:39:52,069 --> 02:39:57,178
His eyes were fixed steadily upon the
open window and the sunshine outside.

3096
02:39:57,178 --> 02:40:01,648
There he watched the movement of the
leaves upon the green cottonwoods.

3097
02:40:01,648 --> 02:40:04,644
What had she said to him when she went?

3098
02:40:04,644 --> 02:40:07,889
She had said, “Now I know how
unhappy I have been.”

3099
02:40:07,889 --> 02:40:13,581
These sweet words he repeated to himself
over and over, fearing in some way that

3100
02:40:13,581 --> 02:40:14,591
he might lose them.

3101
02:40:14,591 --> 02:40:19,631
They almost slipped from him at times;
but with a jump of his mind he caught

3102
02:40:19,631 --> 02:40:24,825
them again and held them⁠—and then⁠—“I’m
not all strong yet,” he murmured.

3103
02:40:24,825 --> 02:40:26,637
“I must have been very sick.”

3104
02:40:26,637 --> 02:40:30,197
And, weak from his bullet wound and
fever, he closed his

3105
02:40:30,197 --> 02:40:32,155
eyes without knowing it.

3106
02:40:32,155 --> 02:40:37,450
There were the cottonwoods again,
waving, waving; and he felt the cool,

3107
02:40:37,450 --> 02:40:39,304
pleasant air from the window.

3108
02:40:39,304 --> 02:40:44,213
He saw the light draught stir the ashes
in the great stone fireplace.

3109
02:40:44,213 --> 02:40:47,984
“I have been asleep,” he said.

3110
02:40:47,984 --> 02:40:50,271
“But she was cert’nly here herself.

3111
02:40:50,271 --> 02:40:51,535
Oh, yes.

3112
02:40:51,535 --> 02:40:52,495
Surely.

3113
02:40:52,495 --> 02:40:55,689
She always has to go away every day
because the doctor says⁠—

3114
02:40:55,689 --> 02:40:57,458
why, she was readin’!”

3115
02:40:57,458 --> 02:40:59,259
he broke off, aloud.

3116
02:40:59,259 --> 02:41:00,640
“David Copperfield.”

3117
02:41:00,640 --> 02:41:02,361
There it was on the floor.

3118
02:41:02,361 --> 02:41:03,054
“Aha!

3119
02:41:03,054 --> 02:41:04,875
nailed you anyway!”

3120
02:41:04,875 --> 02:41:05,614
he said.

3121
02:41:05,614 --> 02:41:08,967
“But how scared I am of
myself!⁠—You’re a fool.

3122
02:41:08,967 --> 02:41:10,175
Of course it’s so.

3123
02:41:10,175 --> 02:41:13,321
No fever business could make
yu’ feel like this.”

3124
02:41:13,321 --> 02:41:18,390
His eye dwelt awhile on the fireplace,
next on the deer horns,

3125
02:41:18,390 --> 02:41:25,060
and next it travelled toward the shelf
where her books were;

3126
02:41:25,060 --> 02:41:29,130
but it stopped before reaching them.

3127
02:41:29,130 --> 02:41:33,194
“Better say off the names before
I look,” said he.

3128
02:41:33,194 --> 02:41:35,452
“I’ve had a heap o’ misreading visions.

3129
02:41:35,452 --> 02:41:40,202
And⁠—and supposin’⁠—if this was just my
sickness fooling me some more⁠—

3130
02:41:40,202 --> 02:41:41,402
I’d want to die.

3131
02:41:41,402 --> 02:41:42,523
I would die!

3132
02:41:42,523 --> 02:41:43,813
Now we’ll see.

3133
02:41:43,813 --> 02:41:47,972
If Copperfield is on the floor” (he
looked stealthily to be sure that it

3134
02:41:47,972 --> 02:41:50,933
was), “then she was readin’ to me when
everything happened,

3135
02:41:50,933 --> 02:41:55,087
and then there should be a hole in the
book row, top, left.

3136
02:41:55,087 --> 02:41:59,682
Top, left,” he repeated,
and warily brought his

3137
02:41:59,682 --> 02:42:01,072
glance to the place.

3138
02:42:01,072 --> 02:42:01,754
“Proved!”

3139
02:42:01,754 --> 02:42:02,426
he cried.

3140
02:42:02,426 --> 02:42:03,359
“It’s all so!”

3141
02:42:03,359 --> 02:42:06,543
He now noticed the miniature
of Grandmother Stark.

3142
02:42:06,543 --> 02:42:10,457
“You are awful like her,” he whispered.

3143
02:42:10,457 --> 02:42:12,701
“You’re cert’nly awful like her.

3144
02:42:12,701 --> 02:42:14,665
May I kiss you too, ma’am?”

3145
02:42:14,665 --> 02:42:17,417
Then, tottering, he rose
from his sick-chair.

3146
02:42:17,417 --> 02:42:22,126
The Navajo blanket fell from his
shoulders, and gradually,

3147
02:42:22,126 --> 02:42:24,922
experimentally, he stood upright.

3148
02:42:24,922 --> 02:42:28,574
Helping himself with his hand slowly
along the wall of the room,

3149
02:42:28,574 --> 02:42:32,274
and round to the opposite wall with many
a pause, he reached the picture,

3150
02:42:32,274 --> 02:42:38,328
and very gently touched the forehead of
the ancestral dame with his lips.

3151
02:42:38,328 --> 02:42:42,489
“I promise to make your little
girl happy,” he whispered.

3152
02:42:42,489 --> 02:42:49,618
He almost fell in stooping to the
portrait, but caught himself and stood

3153
02:42:49,618 --> 02:42:53,089
carefully quiet, trembling,
and speaking to himself.

3154
02:42:53,089 --> 02:42:54,496
“Where is your strength?”

3155
02:42:54,496 --> 02:42:55,478
he demanded.

3156
02:42:55,478 --> 02:42:58,468
“I reckon it is joy that
has unsteadied your laigs.”

3157
02:42:58,468 --> 02:42:59,416
The door opened.

3158
02:42:59,416 --> 02:43:01,959
It was she, come back with his dinner.

3159
02:43:01,959 --> 02:43:03,683
“My Heavens!”

3160
02:43:03,683 --> 02:43:08,074
she said; and setting the tray down,
she rushed to him.

3161
02:43:08,074 --> 02:43:11,156
She helped him back to his chair,
and covered him again.

3162
02:43:11,156 --> 02:43:13,916
He had suffered no hurt,
but she clung to him;

3163
02:43:13,916 --> 02:43:18,990
and presently he moved and let himself
kiss her with fuller passion.

3164
02:43:18,990 --> 02:43:20,953
“I will be good,” he whispered.

3165
02:43:20,953 --> 02:43:23,458
“You must,” she said.

3166
02:43:23,458 --> 02:43:24,975
“You looked so pale!”

3167
02:43:24,975 --> 02:43:27,507
“You are speakin’ low
like me,” he answered.

3168
02:43:27,507 --> 02:43:30,273
“But we have no dream we can wake from.”

3169
02:43:30,273 --> 02:43:34,777
Had she surrendered on this day to her
cowpuncher, her wild man?

3170
02:43:34,777 --> 02:43:37,432
Was she forever wholly his?

3171
02:43:37,432 --> 02:43:42,748
Had the Virginian’s fire so melted her
heart that no rift in it remained?

3172
02:43:42,748 --> 02:43:45,596
So she would have thought if any thought
had come to her.

3173
02:43:45,596 --> 02:43:49,821
But in his arms today,
thought was lost in something

3174
02:43:49,821 --> 02:43:50,821
more divine.

3175
02:43:50,821 --> 02:43:52,181
CHAPTER XXIX

3176
02:43:52,181 --> 02:43:53,331
Word to Bennington

3177
02:43:53,331 --> 02:43:57,972
They kept their secret for a while,
or at least they had that special joy of

3178
02:43:57,972 --> 02:44:02,718
believing that no one in all the world
but themselves knew this that

3179
02:44:02,718 --> 02:44:03,670
had happened to them.

3180
02:44:03,670 --> 02:44:08,679
But I think that there was one person who
knew how to keep a secret even better

3181
02:44:08,679 --> 02:44:10,434
than these two lovers.

3182
02:44:10,434 --> 02:44:10,840
Mrs.

3183
02:44:10,840 --> 02:44:13,960
Taylor made no remarks to anyone whatever.

3184
02:44:13,960 --> 02:44:19,061
Nobody on Bear Creek,
however, was so extraordinarily

3185
02:44:19,061 --> 02:44:20,740
cheerful and serene.

3186
02:44:20,740 --> 02:44:26,334
That peculiar severity which she had
manifested in the days when Molly was

3187
02:44:26,334 --> 02:44:31,572
packing her possessions,
had now altogether changed.

3188
02:44:31,572 --> 02:44:34,972
In these days she was endlessly kind and
indulgent to her “deary.”

3189
02:44:34,972 --> 02:44:38,453
Although, as a housekeeper,
Mrs. Taylor believed in punctuality at

3190
02:44:38,453 --> 02:44:42,997
meals, and visited her offspring with
discipline when they were late without

3191
02:44:42,997 --> 02:44:46,757
good and sufficient excuse,
Molly was now exempt from the

3192
02:44:46,757 --> 02:44:49,222
faintest hint of reprimand.

3193
02:44:49,222 --> 02:44:54,085
“And it’s not because you’re not her
mother,” said George Taylor, bitterly.

3194
02:44:54,085 --> 02:44:55,515
“She used to get it, too.

3195
02:44:55,515 --> 02:44:57,396
And we’re the only ones that get it.

3196
02:44:57,396 --> 02:45:00,703
There she comes, just as we’re
about ready to quit!

3197
02:45:00,703 --> 02:45:02,788
Aren’t you going to say nothing to her?”

3198
02:45:02,788 --> 02:45:06,921
“George,” said his mother,
“when you’ve saved a man’s life it’ll be

3199
02:45:06,921 --> 02:45:08,267
time for you to talk.”

3200
02:45:08,267 --> 02:45:12,788
So Molly would come in to her meals with
much irregularity; and her remarks about

3201
02:45:12,788 --> 02:45:18,265
the imperfections of her clock
met with no rejoinder.

3202
02:45:18,265 --> 02:45:24,929
And yet one can scarcely be so severe as
had been Mrs. Taylor,

3203
02:45:24,929 --> 02:45:29,689
and become wholly as mild as milk.

3204
02:45:29,689 --> 02:45:34,355
There was one recurrent event that could
invariably awaken hostile

3205
02:45:34,355 --> 02:45:36,187
symptoms in the dame.

3206
02:45:36,187 --> 02:45:40,214
Whenever she saw a letter arrive with the
Bennington postmark upon it,

3207
02:45:40,214 --> 02:45:42,247
she shook her fist at that letter.

3208
02:45:42,247 --> 02:45:44,201
“What’s family pride?”

3209
02:45:44,201 --> 02:45:45,997
she would say to herself.

3210
02:45:45,997 --> 02:45:49,679
“Taylor could be a Son of the Revolution
if he’d a mind to.

3211
02:45:49,679 --> -1:59:59,000
I wonder if she has told her folks yet.

3212
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

3213
02:45:52,349 --> 02:45:57,401
And when letters directed to Bennington
would go out, Mrs. Taylor would inspect

3214
02:45:57,401 --> 02:46:03,994
every one as if its envelope ought to
grow transparent beneath her eyes,

3215
02:46:03,994 --> 02:46:08,685
and yield up to her its great secret,
if it had one.

3216
02:46:08,685 --> 02:46:17,099
But in truth these letters had no great
secret to yield up, until one day⁠—yes;

3217
02:46:17,099 --> 02:46:22,806
one day Mrs. Taylor would have burst,
were bursting a thing

3218
02:46:22,806 --> 02:46:24,714
that people often did.

3219
02:46:24,714 --> 02:46:28,439
Three letters were the cause of this
emotion on Mrs. Taylor’s part;

3220
02:46:28,439 --> 02:46:34,624
one addressed to Bennington,
one to Dunbarton, and the third⁠—here

3221
02:46:34,624 --> 02:46:38,839
was the great excitement⁠—to Bennington,
but not in the little

3222
02:46:38,839 --> 02:46:40,724
schoolmarm’s delicate writing.

3223
02:46:40,724 --> 02:46:46,627
A man’s hand had traced those plain,
steady vowels and consonants.

3224
02:46:46,627 --> 02:46:47,762
“It’s come!”

3225
02:46:47,762 --> 02:46:51,162
exclaimed Mrs. Taylor, at this sight.

3226
02:46:51,162 --> 02:46:54,467
“He has written to her mother himself.”

3227
02:46:54,467 --> 02:47:00,303
That is what the Virginian had done,
and here is how it had come about.

3228
02:47:00,303 --> 02:47:04,024
The sick man’s convalescence was achieved.

3229
02:47:04,024 --> 02:47:07,787
The weeks had brought back to him,
not his whole strength yet⁠—that could

3230
02:47:07,787 --> 02:47:12,187
come only by many miles of open air on
the back of Monte; but he was strong

3231
02:47:12,187 --> 02:47:15,128
enough now to get strength.

3232
02:47:15,128 --> 02:47:19,394
When a patient reaches this stage,
he is out of the woods.

3233
02:47:19,394 --> 02:47:22,332
He had gone for a little
walk with his nurse.

3234
02:47:22,332 --> 02:47:26,353
They had taken (under the doctor’s
recommendation) several such little

3235
02:47:26,353 --> 02:47:30,654
walks, beginning with a five-minute one,
and at last today accomplishing

3236
02:47:30,654 --> 02:47:31,527
three miles.

3237
02:47:31,527 --> 02:47:34,544
“No, it has not been too far,” said he.

3238
02:47:34,544 --> 02:47:37,974
“I am afraid I could walk twice as far.”

3239
02:47:37,974 --> 02:47:39,116
“Afraid?”

3240
02:47:39,116 --> 02:47:40,167
“Yes.

3241
02:47:40,167 --> 02:47:42,745
Because it means I can go to work again.

3242
02:47:42,745 --> 02:47:44,893
This thing we have had together is over.”

3243
02:47:44,893 --> 02:47:46,731
For reply, she leaned against him.

3244
02:47:46,731 --> 02:47:47,768
“Look at you!”

3245
02:47:47,768 --> 02:47:48,541
he said.

3246
02:47:48,541 --> 02:47:53,570
“Only a little while ago you had to help
me stand on my laigs.

3247
02:47:53,570 --> 02:47:57,309
And now⁠—” For a while there
was silence between them.

3248
02:47:57,309 --> 02:48:01,584
“I have never had a right down sickness
before,” he presently went on.

3249
02:48:01,584 --> 02:48:03,199
“Not to remember, that is.

3250
02:48:03,199 --> 02:48:08,863
If any person had told me I could enjoy
such a thing⁠—” He said no more,

3251
02:48:08,863 --> 02:48:12,825
for she reached up, and no
more speech was possible.

3252
02:48:12,825 --> 02:48:14,033
“How long has it been?”

3253
02:48:14,033 --> 02:48:15,198
he next asked her.

3254
02:48:15,198 --> 02:48:16,457
She told him.

3255
02:48:16,457 --> 02:48:20,105
“Well, if it could be forever⁠—no.

3256
02:48:20,105 --> 02:48:23,526
Not forever with no more than this.

3257
02:48:23,526 --> 02:48:25,415
I reckon I’d be sick again!

3258
02:48:25,415 --> 02:48:29,800
But if it could be forever with just you
and me, and no one else to bother with.

3259
02:48:29,800 --> 02:48:32,703
But any longer would not be doing
right by your mother.

3260
02:48:32,703 --> 02:48:35,305
She would have a right to
think ill of me.”

3261
02:48:35,305 --> 02:48:35,823
“Oh!”

3262
02:48:35,823 --> 02:48:36,543
said the girl.

3263
02:48:36,543 --> -1:59:59,000
“Let us keep it.”

3264
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
“

3265
02:48:37,567 --> 02:48:39,074
Not after I am gone.

3266
02:48:39,074 --> 02:48:41,144
Your mother must be told.”

3267
02:48:41,144 --> 02:48:44,647
“It seems so⁠—can’t we⁠—oh,
why need anybody know?”

3268
02:48:44,647 --> 02:48:47,632
“Your mother ain’t ‘anybody.’

3269
02:48:47,632 --> 02:48:48,416
She is your mother.

3270
02:48:48,416 --> 02:48:51,556
I feel mighty responsible to her for
what I have done.”

3271
02:48:51,556 --> 02:48:52,732
“But I did it!”

3272
02:48:52,732 --> 02:48:53,746
“Do you think so?

3273
02:48:53,746 --> 02:48:56,570
Your mother will not think so.

3274
02:48:56,570 --> 02:48:58,856
I am going to write to her today.”

3275
02:48:58,856 --> 02:48:59,490
“You!

3276
02:48:59,490 --> 02:49:01,550
Write to my mother!

3277
02:49:01,550 --> 02:49:05,278
Oh, then everything will be so different!

3278
02:49:05,278 --> 02:49:09,845
They will all⁠—” Molly stopped before the
rising visions of Bennington.

3279
02:49:09,845 --> 02:49:14,286
Upon the fairytale that she had been
living with her cowboy lover broke the

3280
02:49:14,286 --> 02:49:18,528
voices of the world.

3281
02:49:19,309 --> 02:49:21,777
She could hear them from afar.

3282
02:49:21,777 --> 02:49:26,374
She could see the eyes of Bennington
watching this man at her side.

3283
02:49:26,374 --> 02:49:31,205
She could imagine the ears of Bennington
listening for slips in his English.

3284
02:49:31,205 --> 02:49:35,016
There loomed upon her the round of visits
which they would have to make.

3285
02:49:35,016 --> 02:49:38,457
The ringing of the doorbells,
the waiting in drawing-rooms for the

3286
02:49:38,457 --> 02:49:42,445
mistress to descend and utter her
prepared congratulations,

3287
02:49:42,445 --> 02:49:46,332
while her secret eye devoured the
Virginian’s appearance,

3288
02:49:46,332 --> 02:49:48,479
and his manner of standing and sitting.

3289
02:49:48,479 --> 02:49:51,692
He would be wearing gloves,
instead of fringed gauntlets of

3290
02:49:51,692 --> 02:49:52,632
buckskin.

3291
02:49:52,632 --> 02:49:58,316
In a smooth black coat and waistcoat,
how could they perceive the man he was?

3292
02:49:58,316 --> 02:50:01,937
During those short formal interviews,
what would they ever find out of the

3293
02:50:01,937 --> 02:50:03,445
things that she knew about him?

3294
02:50:03,445 --> 02:50:06,066
The things for which she was proud of him?

3295
02:50:06,066 --> 02:50:11,682
He would speak shortly and simply;
they would say, “Oh, yes!”

3296
02:50:11,682 --> 02:50:15,802
and “How different you must find this
from Wyoming!”⁠—and then,

3297
02:50:15,802 --> 02:50:21,143
after the door was shut behind his
departing back they would say⁠—He would

3298
02:50:21,143 --> 02:50:24,876
be totally underrated,
not in the least understood.

3299
02:50:24,876 --> 02:50:26,921
Why should he be subjected to this?

3300
02:50:26,921 --> 02:50:28,316
He should never be!

3301
02:50:28,316 --> 02:50:33,901
Now in all these half-formed,
hurried, distressing thoughts which

3302
02:50:33,901 --> 02:50:38,964
streamed through the girl’s mind,
she altogether forgot one truth.

3303
02:50:38,964 --> 02:50:44,053
True it was that the voice of the world
would speak as she imagined.

3304
02:50:44,053 --> 02:50:48,495
True it was that in the eyes of her
family and acquaintance this lover of

3305
02:50:48,495 --> 02:50:53,838
her choice would be examined even more
like a specimen than are other lovers

3306
02:50:53,838 --> 02:50:57,611
upon these occasions:
and all accepted lovers have to face

3307
02:50:57,611 --> 02:51:02,826
this ordeal of being treated like
specimens by the other family.

3308
02:51:02,826 --> 02:51:03,700
But dear me!

3309
02:51:03,700 --> 02:51:06,823
most of us manage to stand it, don’t we?

3310
02:51:06,823 --> 02:51:11,346
It isn’t, perhaps, the most delicious
experience that we can recall in

3311
02:51:11,346 --> 02:51:12,951
connection with our engagement.

3312
02:51:12,951 --> 02:51:14,861
But it didn’t prove fatal.

3313
02:51:14,861 --> 02:51:16,268
We got through it somehow.

3314
02:51:16,268 --> 02:51:19,736
We dined with Aunt Jane,
and wined with Uncle Joseph,

3315
02:51:19,736 --> 02:51:24,312
and perhaps had two fingers given to us
by old Cousin Horatio,

3316
02:51:24,312 --> 02:51:28,391
whose enormous fortune was of the
greatest importance to everybody.

3317
02:51:28,391 --> 02:51:32,258
And perhaps fragments of the other
family’s estimate of us subsequently

3318
02:51:32,258 --> 02:51:34,278
reached our own ears.

3319
02:51:34,278 --> 02:51:38,278
But if a chosen lover cannot stand being
treated as a specimen by the other

3320
02:51:38,278 --> 02:51:42,849
family, he’s a very weak vessel,
and not worth any good girl’s love.

3321
02:51:42,849 --> 02:51:45,149
That’s all I can say for him.

3322
02:51:45,149 --> 02:51:49,521
Now the Virginian was scarcely what even
his enemy would term a weak vessel;

3323
02:51:49,521 --> 02:51:53,149
and Molly’s jealousy of the impression
which he might make upon

3324
02:51:53,149 --> 02:51:56,002
Bennington was vastly superfluous.

3325
02:51:56,002 --> 02:51:59,630
She should have known that he would
indeed care to make a good impression;

3326
02:51:59,630 --> 02:52:04,566
but that such anxiety on his part would
be wholly for her sake,

3327
02:52:04,566 --> 02:52:08,377
that in the eyes of her friends she
might stand justified in taking him

3328
02:52:08,377 --> 02:52:09,657
for her wedded husband.

3329
02:52:09,657 --> 02:52:14,902
So far as he was concerned apart from
her, Aunt Jane and Uncle Joseph might

3330
02:52:14,902 --> 02:52:18,792
say anything they pleased,
or think anything they pleased.

3331
02:52:18,792 --> 02:52:22,136
His character was open for investigation.

3332
02:52:22,136 --> 02:52:25,459
Judge Henry would vouch for him.

3333
02:52:25,459 --> 02:52:29,831
This is what he would have said to his
sweetheart had she but revealed

3334
02:52:29,831 --> 02:52:31,813
to him her perturbations.

3335
02:52:31,813 --> 02:52:35,302
But she did not reveal them;
and they were not of the order that he

3336
02:52:35,302 --> 02:52:38,005
with his nature was likely to divine.

3337
02:52:38,005 --> 02:52:41,483
I do not know what good would have come
from her speaking out to him,

3338
02:52:41,483 --> 02:52:45,336
unless that perfect understanding
between lovers which indeed

3339
02:52:45,336 --> 02:52:46,602
is a good thing.

3340
02:52:46,602 --> 02:52:52,180
But I do not believe that he could have
reassured her; and I am certain that she

3341
02:52:52,180 --> 02:52:54,734
could not have prevented his
writing to her mother.

3342
02:52:54,734 --> 02:52:59,459
“Well, then,” she sighed at last,
“if you think so, I will tell her.”

3343
02:52:59,459 --> 02:53:06,793
That sigh of hers, be it well understood,
was not only because of those far-off

3344
02:53:06,793 --> 02:53:10,915
voices which the world would in
consequence of her news

3345
02:53:10,915 --> 02:53:12,235
be lifting presently.

3346
02:53:12,235 --> 02:53:16,814
It came also from bidding farewell to the
fairytale which she must leave now;

3347
02:53:16,814 --> 02:53:22,445
that land in which she and he had been
living close together alone,

3348
02:53:22,445 --> 02:53:25,827
unhindered, unmindful of all things.

3349
02:53:25,827 --> 02:53:29,901
“Yes, you will tell her,” said her lover.

3350
02:53:29,901 --> 02:53:31,358
“And I must tell her too.”

3351
02:53:31,358 --> 02:53:32,272
“Both of us?”

3352
02:53:32,272 --> 02:53:33,454
questioned the girl.

3353
02:53:33,454 --> 02:53:35,481
What would he say to her mother?

3354
02:53:35,481 --> 02:53:39,927
How would her mother like such a letter
as he would write to her?

3355
02:53:39,927 --> 02:53:42,268
Suppose he should misspell a word?

3356
02:53:42,268 --> 02:53:47,741
Would not sentences from him at this
time⁠—written sentences⁠—be a further

3357
02:53:47,741 --> -1:59:59,000
bar to his welcome acceptance
at Bennington

3358
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
?

3359
02:53:51,557 --> 02:53:54,308
“Why don’t you send messages by me?”

3360
02:53:54,308 --> 02:53:55,048
she asked him.

3361
02:53:55,048 --> 02:53:55,909
He shook his head.

3362
02:53:55,909 --> 02:53:59,083
“She is not going to like
it, anyway,” he answered.

3363
02:53:59,083 --> 02:54:01,218
“I must speak to her direct.

3364
02:54:01,218 --> 02:54:03,327
It would be like shirking.”

3365
02:54:03,327 --> 02:54:08,423
Molly saw how true his instinct was here;
and a little flame shot upward from the

3366
02:54:08,423 --> 02:54:11,053
glow of her love and pride in him.

3367
02:54:11,053 --> 02:54:15,360
Oh, if they could all only know that he
was like this when you understood him!

3368
02:54:15,360 --> 02:54:19,052
She did not dare say out to him what her
fear was about this letter of

3369
02:54:19,052 --> 02:54:20,862
his to her mother.

3370
02:54:20,862 --> 02:54:25,366
She did not dare because⁠—well,
because she lacked a little faith.

3371
02:54:25,366 --> 02:54:26,813
That is it, I am afraid.

3372
02:54:26,813 --> 02:54:30,708
And for that sin she was
her own punishment.

3373
02:54:30,708 --> 02:54:37,067
For in this day, and in many days to
come, the pure joy of her love was vexed

3374
02:54:37,067 --> 02:54:42,743
and clouded, all through a little lack
of faith; while for him,

3375
02:54:42,743 --> 02:54:46,025
perfect in his faith,
his joy was like crystal.

3376
02:54:46,025 --> 02:54:49,094
“Tell me what you’re going
to write,” she said.

3377
02:54:49,094 --> 02:54:50,855
He smiled at her.

3378
02:54:50,855 --> 02:54:52,175
“No.”

3379
02:54:52,175 --> 02:54:56,322
“Aren’t you going to let me see
it when it’s done?”

3380
02:54:56,322 --> 02:54:56,898
“No.”

3381
02:54:56,898 --> 02:54:59,353
Then a freakish look came into his eyes.

3382
02:54:59,353 --> 02:55:01,522
“I’ll let yu’ see anything I
write to other women.”

3383
02:55:01,522 --> 02:55:03,717
And he gave her one of his long kisses.

3384
02:55:03,717 --> 02:55:08,419
“Let’s get through with it together,”
he suggested, when they were once more

3385
02:55:08,419 --> 02:55:12,480
in his sickroom, that room which she
had given to him.

3386
02:55:12,480 --> 02:55:15,725
“You’ll sit one side o’ the table,
and I’ll sit the other,

3387
02:55:15,725 --> 02:55:19,026
and we’ll go ahaid; and pretty soon
it will be done.”

3388
02:55:19,026 --> 02:55:20,620
“O dear!”

3389
02:55:20,620 --> 02:55:21,422
she said.

3390
02:55:21,422 --> 02:55:23,820
“Yes, I suppose that is the best way.”

3391
02:55:23,820 --> 02:55:26,730
And so, accordingly, they
took their places.

3392
02:55:26,730 --> 02:55:28,694
The inkstand stood between them.

3393
02:55:28,694 --> 02:55:33,750
Beside each of them she distributed paper
enough, almost, for a

3394
02:55:33,750 --> 02:55:35,059
presidential message.

3395
02:55:35,059 --> 02:55:37,743
And pens and pencils were in plenty.

3396
02:55:37,743 --> 02:55:42,845
Was this not the headquarters of
the Bear Creek schoolmarm?

3397
02:55:42,845 --> 02:55:45,704
“Why, aren’t you going to do
it in pencil first?”

3398
02:55:45,704 --> 02:55:49,181
she exclaimed, looking up
from her vacant sheet.

3399
02:55:49,181 --> 02:55:52,211
His pen was moving slowly, but steadily.

3400
02:55:52,211 --> 02:55:56,995
“No, I don’t reckon I need to,”
he answered, with his nose

3401
02:55:56,995 --> 02:55:58,242
close to the paper.

3402
02:55:58,242 --> 02:56:00,455
“Oh, damnation, there’s a blot!”

3403
02:56:00,455 --> 02:56:05,107
He tore his spoiled beginning in small
bits, and threw them into the fireplace.

3404
02:56:05,107 --> 02:56:09,251
“You’ve got it too full,”
he commented; and taking the inkstand,

3405
02:56:09,251 --> 02:56:11,079
he tipped a little from it
out of the window.

3406
02:56:11,079 --> 02:56:15,073
She sat lost among her false starts.

3407
02:56:15,073 --> 02:56:18,210
Had she heard him swear,
she would not have minded.

3408
02:56:18,210 --> 02:56:20,435
She rather liked it when he swore.

3409
02:56:20,435 --> 02:56:25,606
He possessed that quality in his
profanity of not offending by it.

3410
02:56:25,606 --> 02:56:30,832
It is quite wonderful how much worse the
same word will sound in one man’s

3411
02:56:30,832 --> 02:56:33,216
lips than in another’s.

3412
02:56:33,216 --> 02:56:35,220
But she did not hear him.

3413
02:56:35,220 --> 02:56:38,921
Her mind was among a litter
of broken sentences.

3414
02:56:38,921 --> 02:56:42,626
Each thought which she began ran out into
the empty air, or came

3415
02:56:42,626 --> 02:56:44,226
against some stone wall.

3416
02:56:44,226 --> 02:56:49,066
So there she sat, her eyes now upon that
inexorable blank sheet that lay before

3417
02:56:49,066 --> 02:56:53,951
her, waiting, and now turned with vacant
hopelessness upon the sundry

3418
02:56:53,951 --> 02:56:55,913
objects in the room.

3419
02:56:55,913 --> 02:57:01,529
And while she thus sat accomplishing
nothing, opposite to her the black head

3420
02:57:01,529 --> 02:57:06,028
bent down, and the steady pen moved
from phrase to phrase.

3421
02:57:06,028 --> 02:57:10,322
She became aware of his gazing at
her, flushed and solemn.

3422
02:57:10,322 --> 02:57:14,362
That strange color of the seawater,
which she could never name,

3423
02:57:14,362 --> 02:57:16,002
was lustrous in his eyes.

3424
02:57:16,002 --> 02:57:17,762
He was folding his letter.

3425
02:57:17,762 --> 02:57:19,320
“You have finished?”

3426
02:57:19,320 --> 02:57:20,073
she said.

3427
02:57:20,073 --> 02:57:20,970
“Yes.”

3428
02:57:20,970 --> 02:57:22,995
His voice was very quiet.

3429
02:57:22,995 --> 02:57:24,890
“I feel like an honester man.”

3430
02:57:24,890 --> 02:57:30,159
“Perhaps I can do something tonight at
Mrs. Taylor’s,” she said,

3431
02:57:30,159 --> 02:57:31,079
looking at her paper.

3432
02:57:31,079 --> 02:57:34,342
On it were a few words crossed out.

3433
02:57:34,342 --> 02:57:36,822
This was all she had to show.

3434
02:57:36,822 --> 02:57:41,386
At this set task in letter-writing,
the cowpuncher had greatly

3435
02:57:41,386 --> 02:57:42,851
excelled the schoolmarm!

3436
02:57:42,851 --> 02:57:47,146
But that night, while he lay quite fast
asleep in his bed, she was keeping vigil

3437
02:57:47,146 --> 02:57:49,306
in her room at Mrs. Taylor’s.

3438
02:57:49,306 --> 02:57:53,146
Accordingly, the next day,
those three letters departed for the

3439
02:57:53,146 --> 02:57:58,210
mail, and Mrs. Taylor consequently made
her exclamation, “It’s come!”

3440
02:57:58,210 --> 02:58:03,229
On the day before the Virginian returned
to take up his work at Judge Henry’s

3441
02:58:03,229 --> 02:58:08,991
ranch, he and Molly announced their
news.

3442
02:58:08,991 --> 02:58:15,291
What Molly said to Mrs. Taylor and what
Mrs. Taylor said to her,

3443
02:58:15,291 --> 02:58:18,612
is of no interest to us,
though it was of much to them.

3444
02:58:18,612 --> 02:58:23,735
But Mr. McLean happened to make a call
quite early in the morning to inquire

3445
02:58:23,735 --> 02:58:25,074
for his friend’s health.

3446
02:58:25,074 --> 02:58:29,215
“Lin,” began the Virginian,
“there is no harm in your knowing an

3447
02:58:29,215 --> 02:58:31,855
hour or so before the rest, I am⁠—”

3448
02:58:31,855 --> 02:58:32,865
“Lord!”

3449
02:58:32,865 --> 02:58:34,724
said Mr. McLean, indulgently.

3450
02:58:34,724 --> 02:58:39,246
“Everybody has knowed that since the day
she found yu’ at the spring.”

3451
02:58:39,246 --> 02:58:42,924
“It was not so, then,”
said the Virginian, crossly.

3452
02:58:42,924 --> 02:58:43,652
“Lord!

3453
02:58:43,652 --> 02:58:45,630
Everybody has knowed it right along.”

3454
02:58:45,630 --> 02:58:46,212
“Hmp!”

3455
02:58:46,212 --> 02:58:47,411
said the Virginian.

3456
02:58:47,411 --> 02:58:51,703
“I didn’t know this country was
that rank with gossips.”

3457
02:58:51,703 --> 02:58:52,193
Mr.

3458
02:58:52,193 --> 02:58:54,764
McLean laughed mirthfully at the lover.

3459
02:58:54,764 --> 02:58:57,490
“Well,” he said, “Mrs.

3460
02:58:57,490 --> 02:58:59,167
McLean will be glad.

3461
02:58:59,167 --> 02:59:02,767
She told me to give yu’ her
congratulations quite a while ago.

3462
02:59:02,767 --> 02:59:06,807
I was to have ’em ready just as soon as
ever yu’ asked for ’em yourself.”

3463
02:59:06,807 --> 02:59:11,891
Lin had been made a happy man some twelve
months previous to this.

3464
02:59:11,891 --> 02:59:16,971
And now, by way of an exchange of news,
he added: “We’re expectin’ a little

3465
02:59:16,971 --> 02:59:19,058
McLean down on Box Elder.

3466
02:59:19,058 --> 02:59:22,097
That’s what you’ll be expectin’ some of
these days, I hope.”

3467
02:59:22,097 --> 02:59:25,361
“Yes,” murmured the Virginian,
“I hope so too.”

3468
02:59:25,361 --> 02:59:29,584
“And I don’t guess,” said Lin,
“that you and I will do much shufflin’

3469
02:59:29,584 --> -1:59:59,000
of other folks’ children any more.

3470
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

3471
02:59:31,424 --> 02:59:35,624
Whereupon he and the Virginian shook
hands silently, and understood

3472
02:59:35,624 --> 02:59:37,694
each other very well.

3473
02:59:37,694 --> 02:59:42,030
On the day that the Virginian parted with
Molly, beside the weight of farewell

3474
02:59:42,030 --> 02:59:46,918
which lay heavy on his heart,
his thoughts were also grave with news.

3475
02:59:46,918 --> 02:59:51,844
The cattle thieves had
grown more audacious.

3476
02:59:51,844 --> 02:59:55,685
Horses and cattle both were being missed,
and each man began almost

3477
02:59:55,685 --> 02:59:56,927
to doubt his neighbor.

3478
02:59:56,927 --> 03:00:01,545
“Steps will have to be taken soon by
somebody, I reckon,” said the lover.

3479
03:00:01,545 --> 03:00:03,011
“By you?”

3480
03:00:03,011 --> 03:00:04,128
she asked quickly.

3481
03:00:04,128 --> 03:00:06,248
“Most likely I’ll get mixed up with it.”

3482
03:00:06,248 --> 03:00:07,932
“What will you have to do?”

3483
03:00:07,932 --> 03:00:08,928
“Can’t say.

3484
03:00:08,928 --> -1:59:59,000
I’ll tell yu’ when I come back.

3485
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

3486
03:00:11,499 --> 03:00:14,659
So did he part from her,
leaving her more kisses

3487
03:00:14,659 --> 03:00:16,319
than words to remember.

3488
03:00:16,319 --> 03:00:20,578
And what was doing at Bennington,
meanwhile, and at Dunbarton?

3489
03:00:20,578 --> 03:00:25,011
Those three letters which by their mere
outside had so moved Mrs. Taylor,

3490
03:00:25,011 --> 03:00:28,664
produced by their contents
much painful disturbance.

3491
03:00:28,664 --> 03:00:33,229
It will be remembered that Molly wrote to
her mother, and to her great-aunt.

3492
03:00:33,229 --> 03:00:36,926
That announcement to her
mother was undertaken first.

3493
03:00:36,926 --> 03:00:42,345
Its composition occupied three hours and
a half, and it filled eleven pages,

3494
03:00:42,345 --> 03:00:44,463
not counting a postscript
upon the twelfth.

3495
03:00:44,463 --> 03:00:47,965
The letter to the great-aunt
took only ten minutes.

3496
03:00:47,965 --> 03:00:52,361
I cannot pretend to explain why this one
was so greatly superior to the other;

3497
03:00:52,361 --> 03:00:54,137
but such is the remarkable fact.

3498
03:00:54,137 --> 03:00:56,945
Its beginning, to be sure,
did give the old lady a start;

3499
03:00:56,945 --> 03:00:59,916
she had dismissed the
cowboy from her probabilities.

3500
03:00:59,916 --> 03:01:00,985
“Tut, tut, tut!”

3501
03:01:00,985 --> 03:01:03,381
she exclaimed out loud in her bedroom.

3502
03:01:03,381 --> 03:01:05,549
“She has thrown herself
away on that fellow!”

3503
03:01:05,549 --> 03:01:12,210
But some sentences at the end made her
pause and sit still for a long while.

3504
03:01:12,210 --> 03:01:19,075
The severity upon her face
changed to tenderness, gradually.

3505
03:01:19,075 --> 03:01:21,793
“Ah, me,” she sighed.

3506
03:01:21,793 --> 03:01:24,166
“If marriage were as simple as love!”

3507
03:01:24,166 --> 03:01:27,610
Then she went slowly downstairs,
and out into her garden,

3508
03:01:27,610 --> 03:01:29,955
where she walked long
between the box borders.

3509
03:01:29,955 --> 03:01:34,035
“But if she has found a great love,”
said the old lady at length.

3510
03:01:34,035 --> 03:01:37,235
And she returned to her bedroom,
and opened an old desk,

3511
03:01:37,235 --> 03:01:39,174
and read some old letters.

3512
03:01:39,174 --> 03:01:43,609
There came to her the next morning
a communication from Bennington.

3513
03:01:43,609 --> 03:01:46,887
This had been penned frantically
by poor Mrs. Wood.

3514
03:01:46,887 --> 03:01:50,007
As soon as she had been able to gather
her senses after the shock of her

3515
03:01:50,007 --> 03:01:53,971
daughter’s eleven pages and the
postscript, the mother had poured out

3516
03:01:53,971 --> 03:01:56,929
eight pages herself to the eldest
member of the family.

3517
03:01:56,929 --> 03:02:00,855
There had been, indeed,
much excuse for the poor lady.

3518
03:02:00,855 --> 03:02:06,874
To begin with, Molly had constructed her
whole opening page with the express and

3519
03:02:06,874 --> 03:02:09,692
merciful intention of
preparing her mother.

3520
03:02:09,692 --> 03:02:12,590
Consequently, it made no sense whatever.

3521
03:02:12,590 --> 03:02:16,635
Its effect was the usual effect of
remarks designed to break a thing

3522
03:02:16,635 --> 03:02:17,298
gently.

3523
03:02:17,298 --> 03:02:22,752
It merely made Mrs. Wood’s head swim,
and filled her with a sickening dread.

3524
03:02:22,752 --> 03:02:27,283
“Oh, mercy, Sarah,” she
had cried, “come here.

3525
03:02:27,283 --> 03:02:28,402
What does this mean?”

3526
03:02:28,402 --> 03:02:32,639
And then, fortified by her elder
daughter, she had turned over that first

3527
03:02:32,639 --> 03:02:35,699
page and found what it meant on the
top of the second.

3528
03:02:35,699 --> 03:02:38,883
“A savage with knives and pistols!”

3529
03:02:38,883 --> 03:02:39,733
she wailed.

3530
03:02:39,733 --> 03:02:43,537
“Well, mother, I always told you so,”
said her daughter Sarah.

3531
03:02:43,537 --> 03:02:44,907
“What is a foreman?”

3532
03:02:44,907 --> 03:02:46,089
exclaimed the mother.

3533
03:02:46,089 --> 03:02:47,670
“And who is Judge Henry?”

3534
03:02:47,670 --> 03:02:51,040
“She has taken a sort of
upper servant,” said Sarah.

3535
03:02:51,040 --> 03:02:54,943
“If it is allowed to go as far as a
wedding, I doubt if I can bring

3536
03:02:54,943 --> 03:02:56,867
myself to be present.”

3537
03:02:56,867 --> 03:03:01,544
(This threat she proceeded to make to
Molly, with results that shall be set

3538
03:03:01,544 --> -1:59:59,000
forth in their proper place.

3539
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
)

3540
03:03:03,681 --> 03:03:07,725
“The man appears to have written to me
himself,” said Mrs. Wood.

3541
03:03:07,725 --> 03:03:10,334
“He knows no better,” said Sarah.

3542
03:03:10,334 --> 03:03:11,296
“Bosh!”

3543
03:03:11,296 --> 03:03:13,295
said Sarah’s husband later.

3544
03:03:13,295 --> 03:03:15,501
“It was a very manly thing to do.”

3545
03:03:15,501 --> 03:03:20,167
Thus did consternation rage in
the house at Bennington.

3546
03:03:20,167 --> 03:03:24,287
Molly might have spared herself the many
assurances that she gave concerning the

3547
03:03:24,287 --> 03:03:28,207
universal esteem in which her cowpuncher
was held, and the fair

3548
03:03:28,207 --> 03:03:30,199
prospects which were his.

3549
03:03:30,199 --> 03:03:36,795
So, in the first throes of her despair,
Mrs. Wood wrote those eight not maturely

3550
03:03:36,795 --> 03:03:39,441
considered pages to the great-aunt.

3551
03:03:39,441 --> 03:03:40,770
“Tut, tut, tut!”

3552
03:03:40,770 --> 03:03:42,560
said the great-aunt as she read them.

3553
03:03:42,560 --> 03:03:46,289
Her face was much more severe today.

3554
03:03:46,289 --> 03:03:51,129
“You’d suppose,” she said,
“that the girl had been kidnapped!

3555
03:03:51,129 --> 03:03:54,800
Why, she has kept him
waiting three years!”

3556
03:03:54,800 --> 03:03:57,455
And then she read more,
but soon put the letter

3557
03:03:57,455 --> 03:03:58,532
down with laughter.

3558
03:03:58,532 --> 03:04:02,695
For Mrs. Wood had repeated in writing
that early outburst of hers about a

3559
03:04:02,695 --> 03:04:05,899
savage with knives and pistols.

3560
03:04:05,899 --> 03:04:06,636
“Law!”

3561
03:04:06,636 --> 03:04:07,869
said the great-aunt.

3562
03:04:07,869 --> 03:04:10,465
“Law, what a fool Lizzie is!”

3563
03:04:10,465 --> 03:04:14,780
So she sat down and wrote to Mrs. Wood a
wholesome reply about putting a little

3564
03:04:14,780 --> 03:04:18,780
more trust in her own flesh and blood,
and reminding her among other things

3565
03:04:18,780 --> 03:04:24,082
that General Stark had himself been wont
to carry knives and pistols owing to the

3566
03:04:24,082 --> 03:04:27,642
necessities of his career,
but that he had occasionally taken them

3567
03:04:27,642 --> 03:04:30,546
off, as did probably this
young man in Wyoming.

3568
03:04:30,546 --> 03:04:34,762
“You had better send me the letter he has
written you,” she concluded.

3569
03:04:34,762 --> 03:04:38,122
“I shall know much better what to think
after I have seen that.”

3570
03:04:38,122 --> 03:04:42,223
It is not probable that Mrs. Wood got
much comfort from this communication;

3571
03:04:42,223 --> 03:04:46,510
and her daughter Sarah was
actually enraged by it.

3572
03:04:46,510 --> 03:04:52,763
“She grows more perverse as she nears
her dotage,” said Sarah.

3573
03:04:52,763 --> 03:04:57,107
But the Virginian’s letter was sent to
Dunbarton, where the old lady sat

3574
03:04:57,107 --> 03:05:00,813
herself down to read
it with much attention.

3575
03:05:00,813 --> 03:05:05,121
Here is what the Virginian had said to
the unknown mother of his sweetheart.

3576
03:05:05,121 --> 03:05:05,545
Mrs.

3577
03:05:05,545 --> 03:05:07,145
John Stark Wood,

3578
03:05:07,145 --> 03:05:09,603
Bennington, Vermont.

3579
03:05:09,603 --> 03:05:10,215
Madam:

3580
03:05:10,215 --> 03:05:14,099
If your daughter Miss Wood has ever told
you about her saving a man’s life here

3581
03:05:14,099 --> 03:05:19,256
when some Indians had shot him that is
the man who writes to you now.

3582
03:05:19,256 --> 03:05:22,970
I don’t think she can have told you right
about that affair for she is the only

3583
03:05:22,970 --> 03:05:25,411
one in this country who thinks it
was a little thing.

3584
03:05:25,411 --> 03:05:28,136
So I must tell you it, the main points.

3585
03:05:28,136 --> 03:05:31,509
Such an action would have been thought
highly of in a Western girl,

3586
03:05:31,509 --> 03:05:36,155
but with Miss Wood’s raising nobody had
a right to expect it.

3587
03:05:36,155 --> 03:05:37,086
“Indeed!”

3588
03:05:37,086 --> 03:05:38,853
snorted the great-aunt.

3589
03:05:38,853 --> 03:05:42,810
“Well, he would be right,
if I had not had a good deal more to do

3590
03:05:42,810 --> 03:05:45,260
with her ‘raising’ than ever Lizzie
had.”

3591
03:05:45,260 --> 03:05:46,971
And she went on with the letter.

3592
03:05:46,971 --> 03:05:50,893
I was starting in to die
when she found me.

3593
03:05:50,893 --> 03:05:54,473
I did not know anything then,
and she pulled me back from where I was

3594
03:05:54,473 --> 03:05:56,372
half in the next world.

3595
03:05:56,372 --> 03:06:00,976
She did not know but what Indians would
get her too but I could not

3596
03:06:00,976 --> 03:06:02,494
make her leave me.

3597
03:06:02,494 --> 03:06:07,128
I am a heavy man one hundred and seventy-
three stripped when in full health.

3598
03:06:07,128 --> 03:06:11,795
She lifted me herself from the ground me
helping scarce any for there was not

3599
03:06:11,795 --> 03:06:13,514
much help in me that day.

3600
03:06:13,514 --> 03:06:17,669
She washed my wound and brought me to
with her own whiskey.

3601
03:06:17,669 --> 03:06:21,309
Before she could get me home I was out of
my head but she kept me on my horse

3602
03:06:21,309 --> 03:06:26,252
somehow and talked wisely to me so I
minded her and did not go clean crazy

3603
03:06:26,252 --> 03:06:28,160
till she had got me safe to bed.

3604
03:06:28,160 --> 03:06:32,563
The doctor says I would have died all the
same if she had not nursed me

3605
03:06:32,563 --> 03:06:33,723
the way she did.

3606
03:06:33,723 --> 03:06:37,474
It made me love her more which I did
not know I could.

3607
03:06:37,474 --> 03:06:41,975
But there is no end, for this writing it
down makes me love her more

3608
03:06:41,975 --> 03:06:43,055
as I write it.

3609
03:06:43,055 --> 03:06:48,577
And now Mrs. Wood I am sorry this will be
bad news for you to hear.

3610
03:06:48,577 --> 03:06:52,535
I know you would never choose such a man
as I am for her for I have got no

3611
03:06:52,535 --> 03:06:55,824
education and must write
humble against my birth.

3612
03:06:55,824 --> 03:07:00,896
I wish I could make the news easier but
truth is the best.

3613
03:07:00,896 --> 03:07:02,936
I am of old stock in Virginia.

3614
03:07:02,936 --> 03:07:13,601
English and one Scotch Irish grandmother
my father’s father brought from

3615
03:07:13,601 --> 03:07:15,472
Kentucky.

3616
03:07:15,472 --> 03:07:21,778
We have always stayed at the same place
farmers and hunters not bettering our

3617
03:07:21,778 --> 03:07:23,759
lot and very plain.

3618
03:07:23,759 --> 03:07:28,380
We have fought when we got the chance,
under Old Hickory and in Mexico and my

3619
03:07:28,380 --> 03:07:32,716
father and two brothers were killed in
the Valley sixty-four.

3620
03:07:32,716 --> 03:07:38,595
Always with us one son has been apt to
run away and I was the one this time.

3621
03:07:38,595 --> 03:07:41,800
I had too much older brothering
to suit me.

3622
03:07:41,800 --> 03:07:47,078
But now I am doing well being in full
sight of prosperity and not too old and

3623
03:07:47,078 --> 03:07:53,171
very strong my health having stood the
sundries it has been put through.

3624
03:07:53,171 --> 03:07:56,376
She shall teach school no more
when she is mine.

3625
03:07:56,376 --> 03:08:01,210
I wish I could make this news easier
for you Mrs. Wood.

3626
03:08:01,210 --> 03:08:04,443
I do not like promises I
have heard so many.

3627
03:08:04,443 --> 03:08:08,582
I will tell any man of your family
anything he likes to ask one,

3628
03:08:08,582 --> 03:08:11,477
and Judge Henry would tell
you about my reputation.

3629
03:08:11,477 --> 03:08:17,300
I have seen plenty rough things but can
say I have never killed for pleasure or

3630
03:08:17,300 --> 03:08:23,003
profit and am not one of that
kind, always preferring peace.

3631
03:08:23,003 --> 03:08:27,083
I have had to live in places where they
had courts and lawyers so called but an

3632
03:08:27,083 --> 03:08:31,819
honest man was all the law you could
find in five hundred miles.

3633
03:08:31,819 --> 03:08:35,878
I have not told her about those things
not because I am ashamed of them but

3634
03:08:35,878 --> 03:08:39,605
there are so many things too dark for a
girl like her to hear about.

3635
03:08:39,605 --> 03:08:43,956
I had better tell you the way I know
I love Miss Wood.

3636
03:08:43,956 --> 03:08:47,884
I am not a boy now, and women are no
new thing to me.

3637
03:08:47,884 --> 03:08:53,543
A man like me who has travelled meets
many of them as he goes and passes on

3638
03:08:53,543 --> 03:08:55,935
but I stopped when I came to Miss Wood.

3639
03:08:55,935 --> 03:08:59,660
That is three years but I
have not gone on.

3640
03:08:59,660 --> 03:09:01,361
What right has such as he?

3641
03:09:01,361 --> 03:09:02,458
you will say.

3642
03:09:02,458 --> 03:09:06,740
So did I say it after she
had saved my life.

3643
03:09:06,740 --> 03:09:10,632
It was hard to get to that point and keep
there with her around me all day.

3644
03:09:10,632 --> 03:09:15,020
But I said to myself you have bothered
her for three years with your love and

3645
03:09:15,020 --> 03:09:19,893
if you let your love bother her you
don’t love her like you should and you

3646
03:09:19,893 --> 03:09:23,237
must quit for her sake who
has saved your life.

3647
03:09:23,237 --> 03:09:27,455
I did not know what I was going to do
with my life after that but I supposed I

3648
03:09:27,455 --> 03:09:32,286
could go somewhere and work hard and so
Mrs. Wood I told her I would give her

3649
03:09:32,286 --> 03:09:32,703
up.

3650
03:09:32,703 --> 03:09:34,726
But she said no.

3651
03:09:34,726 --> 03:09:39,206
It is going to be hard for her to get
used to a man like me⁠—

3652
03:09:39,206 --> 03:09:43,799
But at this point in the Virginian’s
letter, the old great-aunt

3653
03:09:43,799 --> 03:09:44,963
could read no more.

3654
03:09:44,963 --> 03:09:49,589
She rose, and went over to that desk
where lay those faded letters of her

3655
03:09:49,589 --> 03:09:50,165
own.

3656
03:09:50,165 --> 03:09:55,309
She laid her head down upon the package,
and as her tears flowed quietly upon it,

3657
03:09:55,309 --> 03:09:57,788
“O dear,” she whispered, “O dear!

3658
03:09:57,788 --> 03:10:00,478
And this is what I lost!”

3659
03:10:00,478 --> 03:10:04,517
To her girl upon Bear Creek she
wrote the next day.

3660
03:10:04,517 --> 03:10:07,986
And this word from Dunbarton was like
balm among the harsh

3661
03:10:07,986 --> 03:10:11,380
stings Molly was receiving.

3662
03:10:11,380 --> 03:10:19,070
The voices of the world reached her in
gathering numbers, and not one of them

3663
03:10:19,070 --> 03:10:21,990
save that great-aunt’s was sweet.

3664
03:10:21,990 --> 03:10:25,149
Her days were full of hurts;
and there was no one by to

3665
03:10:25,149 --> 03:10:26,421
kiss the hurts away.

3666
03:10:26,421 --> 03:10:30,423
Nor did she even hear from her
lover any more now.

3667
03:10:30,423 --> 03:10:34,764
She only knew he had gone into lonely
regions upon his errand.

3668
03:10:34,764 --> 03:10:36,872
That errand took him far:⁠—

3669
03:10:36,872 --> 03:10:44,244
Across the Basin, among the secret places
of Owl Creek, past the Washakie Needles,

3670
03:10:44,244 --> 03:10:49,779
over the Divide to Gros Ventre,
and so through a final barrier of peaks

3671
03:10:49,779 --> 03:10:52,766
into the borders of East Idaho.

3672
03:10:52,766 --> 03:10:57,402
There, by reason of his bidding me,
I met him, and came to share in a

3673
03:10:57,402 --> 03:10:59,432
part of his errand.

3674
03:10:59,432 --> 03:11:02,286
It was with no guide that
I travelled to him.

3675
03:11:02,286 --> 03:11:06,552
He had named a little station on the
railroad, and from thence he had charted

3676
03:11:06,552 --> 03:11:09,005
my route by means of landmarks.

3677
03:11:09,005 --> 03:11:12,474
Did I believe in omens,
the black storm that I set out in upon

3678
03:11:12,474 --> 03:11:14,994
my horse would seem like one today.

3679
03:11:14,994 --> 03:11:21,139
But I had been living in cities and
smoke; and Idaho, even with rain,

3680
03:11:21,139 --> 03:11:22,843
was delightful to me.

3681
03:11:22,843 --> 03:11:24,228
CHAPTER XXX

3682
03:11:24,228 --> 03:11:24,348
A

3683
03:11:24,348 --> 03:11:25,971
Stable on the Flat

3684
03:11:25,971 --> 03:11:28,851
When the first landmark,
the lone clump of cottonwoods,

3685
03:11:28,851 --> 03:11:32,051
came at length in sight,
dark and blurred in the gentle rain,

3686
03:11:32,051 --> 03:11:35,854
standing out perhaps a mile beyond the
distant buildings, my whole weary body

3687
03:11:35,854 --> 03:11:37,414
hailed the approach of repose.

3688
03:11:37,414 --> 03:11:40,294
Saving the noon hour,
I had been in the saddle since six,

3689
03:11:40,294 --> 03:11:42,374
and now six was come round again.

3690
03:11:42,374 --> 03:11:45,734
The ranch, my resting-place for this
night, was a ruin⁠—cabin,

3691
03:11:45,734 --> 03:11:46,934
stable, and corral.

3692
03:11:46,934 --> 03:11:50,098
Yet after the twelve hours of pushing on
and on through silence,

3693
03:11:50,098 --> 03:11:52,378
still to have silence,
still to eat and go to sleep in it,

3694
03:11:52,378 --> 03:11:56,218
perfectly fitted the mood of both
my flesh and spirit.

3695
03:11:56,218 --> 03:11:59,209
At noon, when for a while I had thrown
off my long oilskin coat,

3696
03:11:59,209 --> 03:12:01,879
merely the sight of the newspaper half
crowded into my pocket had been a

3697
03:12:01,879 --> 03:12:05,800
displeasing reminder of the railway,
and cities, and affairs.

3698
03:12:05,800 --> 03:12:09,679
But for its possible help to build fires,
it would have come no farther with me.

3699
03:12:09,679 --> 03:12:13,185
The great levels around me lay cooled and
freed of dust by the wet weather,

3700
03:12:13,185 --> 03:12:14,744
and full of sweet airs.

3701
03:12:14,744 --> 03:12:18,981
Far in front the foothills rose through
the rain, indefinite and mystic.

3702
03:12:18,981 --> 03:12:21,441
I wanted no speech with anyone,
nor to be near human beings at all.

3703
03:12:21,441 --> 03:12:24,661
I was steeped in a revery as of the
primal earth; even thoughts themselves

3704
03:12:24,661 --> 03:12:26,865
had almost ceased motion.

3705
03:12:26,865 --> 03:12:31,549
To lie down with wild animals,
with elk and deer, would have made my

3706
03:12:31,549 --> 03:12:33,939
waking dream complete;
and since such dream could not be,

3707
03:12:33,939 --> 03:12:37,139
the cattle around the deserted
buildings, mere dots as yet across

3708
03:12:37,139 --> 03:12:40,670
separating space, were my proper
companions for this evening.

3709
03:12:40,670 --> 03:12:42,979
Tomorrow night I should probably be
camping with the Virginian

3710
03:12:42,979 --> 03:12:43,939
in the foothills.

3711
03:12:43,939 --> 03:12:46,699
At his letter’s bidding I had come
eastward across Idaho,

3712
03:12:46,699 --> 03:12:49,059
abandoning my hunting in the Saw Tooth
Range to make this journey with him

3713
03:12:49,059 --> 03:12:50,379
back through the Tetons.

3714
03:12:50,379 --> 03:12:52,899
It was a trail known to him,
and not to many other honest men.

3715
03:12:52,899 --> 03:12:54,820
Horse Thief Pass was the name
his letter gave it.

3716
03:12:54,820 --> 03:12:57,530
Business (he was always brief) would call
him over there at this time.

3717
03:12:57,530 --> 03:13:00,650
Returning, he must attend to certain
matters in the Wind River country.

3718
03:13:00,650 --> 03:13:03,556
There I could leave by stage for the
railroad, or go on with him the whole

3719
03:13:03,556 --> 03:13:05,021
way back to Sunk Creek.

3720
03:13:05,021 --> 03:13:07,342
He designated for our meeting the forks
of a certain little stream in the

3721
03:13:07,342 --> 03:13:09,533
foothills which today’s ride
had brought in sight.

3722
03:13:09,533 --> 03:13:12,293
There would be no chance for him to
receive an answer from me

3723
03:13:12,293 --> 03:13:13,493
in the intervening time.

3724
03:13:13,493 --> 03:13:17,053
If by a certain day⁠—which was four days
off still⁠—I had not reached the forks,

3725
03:13:17,053 --> 03:13:18,808
he would understand I had other plans.

3726
03:13:18,808 --> 03:13:22,646
To me it was like living back in ages
gone, this way of meeting my friend,

3727
03:13:22,646 --> 03:13:25,846
this choice of a stream so far and
lonely that its very course upon the

3728
03:13:25,846 --> 03:13:27,286
maps was wrongly traced.

3729
03:13:27,286 --> 03:13:30,646
And to leave behind all noise and
mechanisms, and set out at ease,

3730
03:13:30,646 --> 03:13:33,086
slowly, with one packhorse,
into the wilderness,

3731
03:13:33,086 --> 03:13:36,207
made me feel that the ancient earth was
indeed my mother and that I had found

3732
03:13:36,207 --> 03:13:40,128
her again after being lost among
houses, customs, and restraints.

3733
03:13:40,128 --> 03:13:44,702
I should arrive three days early at the
forks⁠—three days of margin seeming to

3734
03:13:44,702 --> 03:13:46,989
me a wise precaution
against delays unforeseen.

3735
03:13:46,989 --> 03:13:50,484
If the Virginian were not there,
good; I could fish and be happy.

3736
03:13:50,484 --> 03:13:54,199
If he were there but not ready to start,
good; I could still fish and be happy.

3737
03:13:54,199 --> 03:13:58,543
And remembering my Eastern helplessness
in the year when we had met first,

3738
03:13:58,543 --> 03:14:01,384
I enjoyed thinking how I had
come to be trusted.

3739
03:14:01,384 --> 03:14:04,304
In those days I had not been allowed to
go from the ranch for so much as an

3740
03:14:04,304 --> 03:14:08,184
afternoon’s ride unless tied to him by a
string, so to speak;

3741
03:14:08,184 --> 03:14:11,027
now I was crossing unmapped
spaces with no guidance.

3742
03:14:11,027 --> 03:14:13,627
The man who could do this was scarce
any longer a “tenderfoot.”

3743
03:14:13,627 --> 03:14:15,070
My vision, as I rode,
took in serenely the dim foothills⁠—

3744
03:14:15,070 --> 03:14:19,390
tomorrow’s goal⁠—and nearer in the vast
wet plain the clump of cottonwoods,

3745
03:14:19,390 --> 03:14:23,430
and still nearer my lodging for tonight
with the dotted cattle round it.

3746
03:14:23,430 --> 03:14:24,990
And now my horse neighed.

3747
03:14:24,990 --> 03:14:28,906
I felt his gait freshen for the journey’s
end, and leaning to pat his neck I

3748
03:14:28,906 --> 03:14:32,660
noticed his ears no longer slack and
inattentive, but pointing forward to

3749
03:14:32,660 --> 03:14:35,180
where food and rest awaited both of us.

3750
03:14:35,180 --> 03:14:40,410
Twice he neighed, impatiently and long;
and as he quickened his gait still more,

3751
03:14:40,410 --> 03:14:43,931
the packhorse did the same,
and I realized that there was about me

3752
03:14:43,931 --> 03:14:46,440
still a spice of the tenderfoot:
those dots were not cattle;

3753
03:14:46,440 --> 03:14:47,782
they were horses.

3754
03:14:47,782 --> 03:14:49,622
My horse had put me in the wrong.

3755
03:14:49,622 --> 03:14:53,847
He had known his kind from afar,
and was hastening to them.

3756
03:14:53,847 --> 03:14:58,021
The plainsman’s eye was not yet mine;
and I smiled a little as I rode.

3757
03:14:58,021 --> 03:15:01,942
When was I going to know,
as by instinct, the different look of

3758
03:15:01,942 --> 03:15:05,099
horses and cattle across some two or
three miles of plain?

3759
03:15:05,099 --> 03:15:05,939
These miles we finished soon.

3760
03:15:05,939 --> 03:15:08,540
The buildings changed in their aspect as
they grew to my approach,

3761
03:15:08,540 --> 03:15:11,739
showing their desolation more clearly,
and in some way bringing

3762
03:15:11,739 --> 03:15:13,339
apprehension into my mood.

3763
03:15:13,339 --> 03:15:16,571
And around them the horses,
too, all standing with ears erect,

3764
03:15:16,571 --> 03:15:20,403
watching me as I came⁠—there was
something about them;

3765
03:15:20,403 --> 03:15:21,915
or was it the silence?

3766
03:15:21,915 --> 03:15:26,334
For the silence which I had liked until
now seemed suddenly to be made too great

3767
03:15:26,334 --> 03:15:29,055
by the presence of the
deserted buildings.

3768
03:15:29,055 --> 03:15:32,680
And then the door of the stable opened,
and men came out and stood,

3769
03:15:32,680 --> 03:15:34,395
also watching me arrive.

3770
03:15:34,395 --> 03:15:38,098
By the time I was dismounting
more were there.

3771
03:15:38,098 --> 03:15:42,578
It was senseless to feel as unpleasant as
I did, and I strove to give to them a

3772
03:15:42,578 --> 03:15:45,342
greeting that should sound easy.

3773
03:15:45,342 --> 03:15:50,318
I told them that I hoped there was room
for one more here tonight.

3774
03:15:50,318 --> 03:15:53,483
Some of them had answered my greeting,
but none of them answered this;

3775
03:15:53,483 --> 03:15:56,934
and as I began to be sure that I
recognized several of their strangely

3776
03:15:56,934 --> 03:16:00,894
imperturbable faces,
the Virginian came from the stable;

3777
03:16:00,894 --> 03:16:06,922
and at that welcome sight my
relief spoke out instantly.

3778
03:16:06,922 --> 03:16:09,032
“I am here, you see!”

3779
03:16:09,032 --> 03:16:10,616
“Yes, I do see.”

3780
03:16:10,616 --> 03:16:14,918
I looked hard at him,
for in his voice was the same

3781
03:16:14,918 --> 03:16:18,312
strangeness that I felt
in everything around me.

3782
03:16:18,312 --> 03:16:21,351
But he was looking at his companions.

3783
03:16:21,351 --> 03:16:24,897
“This gentleman is all
right,” he told them.

3784
03:16:24,897 --> 03:16:29,739
“That may be,” said one whom I now knew
that I had seen before at Sunk Creek;

3785
03:16:29,739 --> 03:16:31,387
“but he was not due tonight.”

3786
03:16:31,387 --> 03:16:33,114
“Nor tomorrow,” said another.

3787
03:16:33,114 --> 03:16:36,086
“Nor yet the day after,” a third added.

3788
03:16:36,086 --> 03:16:38,123
The Virginian fell into his drawl.

3789
03:16:38,123 --> 03:16:41,582
“None of you was ever early
for anything, I presume.”

3790
03:16:41,582 --> 03:16:43,753
One retorted, laughing,
“Oh, we’re not suspicioning

3791
03:16:43,753 --> 03:16:45,417
you of complicity.”

3792
03:16:45,417 --> 03:16:51,289
And another, “Not even when we remember
how thick you and Steve used to be.”

3793
03:16:51,289 --> 03:16:54,489
Whatever jokes they meant by this he did
not receive as jokes.

3794
03:16:54,489 --> 03:16:59,831
I saw something like a wince pass over
his face, and a flush follow it.

3795
03:16:59,831 --> 03:17:01,372
But he now spoke to me.

3796
03:17:01,372 --> 03:17:06,932
“We expected to be through
before this,” he began.

3797
03:17:06,932 --> 03:17:09,323
“I’m right sorry you have come tonight.

3798
03:17:09,323 --> 03:17:12,083
I know you’d have preferred to keep away.”

3799
03:17:12,083 --> 03:17:17,917
“We want him to explain himself,”
put in one of the others.

3800
03:17:17,917 --> 03:17:22,070
“If he satisfies us, he’s
free to go away.”

3801
03:17:22,070 --> 03:17:23,670
“Free to go away!”

3802
03:17:23,670 --> 03:17:25,470
I now exclaimed.

3803
03:17:25,470 --> 03:17:30,337
But at the indulgence in their frontier
smile I cooled down.

3804
03:17:30,337 --> 03:17:36,735
“Gentlemen,” I said, “I don’t know why my
movements interest you so much.

3805
03:17:36,735 --> 03:17:39,771
It’s quite a compliment!

3806
03:17:39,771 --> 03:17:43,805
May I get under shelter while I explain?”

3807
03:17:43,805 --> 03:17:48,529
No request could have been more natural,
for the rain had now begun to

3808
03:17:48,529 --> 03:17:50,853
fall in straight floods.

3809
03:17:50,853 --> 03:17:54,655
Yet there was a pause before one of them
said, “He might as well.”

3810
03:17:54,655 --> 03:17:59,849
The Virginian chose to say nothing more;
but he walked beside me into the stable.

3811
03:17:59,849 --> 03:18:03,590
Two men sat there together,
and a third guarded them.

3812
03:18:03,590 --> 03:18:07,440
At that sight I knew suddenly what I had
stumbled upon; and on the impulse I

3813
03:18:07,440 --> 03:18:10,151
murmured to the Virginian,
“You’re hanging them tomorrow.”

3814
03:18:10,151 --> 03:18:11,351
He kept his silence.

3815
03:18:11,351 --> 03:18:13,889
“You may have three guesses,”
said a man behind me.

3816
03:18:13,889 --> 03:18:16,243
But I did not need them.

3817
03:18:16,243 --> 03:18:20,478
And in the recoil of my insight the clump
of cottonwoods came into my

3818
03:18:20,478 --> 03:18:22,078
mind, black and grim.

3819
03:18:22,078 --> 03:18:24,201
No other trees high enough
grew within ten miles.

3820
03:18:24,201 --> 03:18:27,398
This, then, was the business that the
Virginian’s letter had

3821
03:18:27,398 --> 03:18:29,548
so curtly mentioned.

3822
03:18:29,548 --> 03:18:35,213
My eyes went into all corners of the
stable, but no other prisoners were

3823
03:18:35,213 --> 03:18:36,484
here.

3824
03:18:36,484 --> 03:18:40,804
I half expected to see Trampas,
and I half feared to see Shorty

3825
03:18:40,804 --> 03:18:46,565
; for poor stupid Shorty’s honesty had
not been proof against frontier

3826
03:18:46,565 --> 03:18:51,366
temptations, and he had fallen away from
the company of his old friends.

3827
03:18:51,366 --> 03:18:55,046
Often of late I had heard talk at Sunk
Creek of breaking up a certain gang of

3828
03:18:55,046 --> 03:18:59,167
horse and cattle thieves that stole in
one Territory and sold in the next,

3829
03:18:59,167 --> 03:19:02,060
and knew where to hide
in the mountains between.

3830
03:19:02,060 --> 03:19:06,474
And now it had come to the point;
forces had been gathered,

3831
03:19:06,474 --> 03:19:10,341
a long expedition made,
and here they were, successful under the

3832
03:19:10,341 --> 03:19:14,469
Virginian’s lead, but a little
later than their calculations.

3833
03:19:14,469 --> 03:19:19,506
And here was I, a little too early,
and a witness in consequence.

3834
03:19:19,506 --> 03:19:23,069
My presence seemed a simple thing to
account for; but when I had thus

3835
03:19:23,069 --> 03:19:26,869
accounted for it, one of them
said with good nature:⁠—

3836
03:19:26,869 --> 03:19:29,789
“So you find us here,
and we find you here.

3837
03:19:29,789 --> 03:19:31,549
Which is the most surprised, I wonder?”

3838
03:19:31,549 --> 03:19:34,131
“There’s no telling,”
said I, keeping as amiable as I could;

3839
03:19:34,131 --> 03:19:36,451
“nor any telling which objects the
most.”

3840
03:19:36,451 --> 03:19:38,851
“Oh, there’s no objection here.

3841
03:19:38,851 --> 03:19:40,356
You’re welcome to stay.

3842
03:19:40,356 --> 03:19:42,571
But not welcome to go, I expect.

3843
03:19:42,571 --> 03:19:44,519
He ain’t welcome to go, is he?”

3844
03:19:44,519 --> 03:19:48,107
By the answers that their faces gave him
it was plain that I was not.

3845
03:19:48,107 --> 03:19:51,088
“Not till we are through,” said one.

3846
03:19:51,088 --> 03:19:53,778
“He needn’t to see anything,”
’ another added.

3847
03:19:53,778 --> 03:19:57,891
“Better sleep late tomorrow morning,”
a third suggested to me.

3848
03:19:57,891 --> 03:20:00,642
I did not wish to stay here.

3849
03:20:00,642 --> 03:20:05,543
I could have made some sort of camp apart
from them before dark;

3850
03:20:05,543 --> 03:20:08,946
but in the face of their needless
caution I was helpless.

3851
03:20:08,946 --> 03:20:13,582
I made no attempt to inquire what kind of
spy they imagined I could be,

3852
03:20:13,582 --> 03:20:17,263
what sort of rescue I could bring in
this lonely country;

3853
03:20:17,263 --> 03:20:21,107
my too early appearance seemed to be all
that they looked at.

3854
03:20:21,107 --> 03:20:22,980
And again my eyes sought the prisoners.

3855
03:20:22,980 --> 03:20:24,907
Certainly there were only two.

3856
03:20:24,907 --> 03:20:29,629
One was chewing tobacco,
and talking now and then to his guard as

3857
03:20:29,629 --> 03:20:31,459
if nothing were the matter.

3858
03:20:31,459 --> 03:20:34,982
The other sat dull in silence,
not moving his eyes;

3859
03:20:34,982 --> 03:20:38,002
but his face worked,
and I noticed how he continually

3860
03:20:38,002 --> 03:20:41,095
moistened his dry lips.

3861
03:20:41,095 --> 03:20:44,895
As I looked at these doomed prisoners,
whose fate I was invited to sleep

3862
03:20:44,895 --> 03:20:47,615
through tomorrow morning,
the one who was chewing

3863
03:20:47,615 --> 03:20:49,295
quietly nodded to me.

3864
03:20:49,295 --> 03:20:51,615
“You don’t remember me?”

3865
03:20:51,615 --> 03:20:52,368
he said.

3866
03:20:52,368 --> 03:20:53,686
It was Steve!

3867
03:20:53,686 --> 03:20:54,846
Steve of Medicine Bow!

3868
03:20:54,846 --> 03:20:57,046
The pleasant Steve of my first
evening in the West.

3869
03:20:57,046 --> 03:21:01,980
Some change of beard had delayed my
instant recognition of his face.

3870
03:21:01,980 --> 03:21:03,600
Here he sat sentenced to die.

3871
03:21:03,600 --> 03:21:06,080
A shock, chill and painful,
deprived me of speech.

3872
03:21:06,080 --> 03:21:07,391
He had no such weak feelings.

3873
03:21:07,391 --> 03:21:10,158
“Have yu’ been to Medicine Bow lately?”

3874
03:21:10,158 --> 03:21:11,634
he inquired.

3875
03:21:11,634 --> 03:21:13,637
“That’s getting to be quite a while ago.”

3876
03:21:13,637 --> 03:21:15,117
I assented.

3877
03:21:15,117 --> 03:21:19,121
I should have liked to say something
natural and kind, but words stuck

3878
03:21:19,121 --> 03:21:23,797
against my will, and I stood awkward and
ill at ease, noticing idly that the

3879
03:21:23,797 --> 03:21:27,277
silent one wore a gray
flannel shirt like mine.

3880
03:21:27,277 --> 03:21:30,687
Steve looked me over,
and saw in my pocket the newspaper which

3881
03:21:30,687 --> 03:21:34,517
I had brought from the railroad and on
which I had pencilled a few expenses.

3882
03:21:34,517 --> 03:21:37,757
He asked me, Would I mind letting him
have it for a while?

3883
03:21:37,757 --> 03:21:40,077
And I gave it to him eagerly,
begging him to keep it as

3884
03:21:40,077 --> 03:21:41,686
long as he wanted.

3885
03:21:41,686 --> 03:21:43,330
I was overeager in my embarrassment.

3886
03:21:43,330 --> 03:21:47,481
“You need not return it at all,”
I said; “those notes are nothing.

3887
03:21:47,481 --> 03:21:47,521
Do keep it.”

3888
03:21:47,521 --> 03:21:49,481
He gave me a short glance and a smile.

3889
03:21:49,481 --> 03:21:52,344
“Thank you,” he said;
“I’ll not need it beyond

3890
03:21:52,344 --> 03:21:52,794
tomorrow morning.”

3891
03:21:52,794 --> 03:21:53,726
And he began to search through it.

3892
03:21:53,726 --> 03:21:58,264
“Jake’s election is considered sure,”
he said to his companion,

3893
03:21:58,264 --> 03:21:59,864
who made no response.

3894
03:21:59,864 --> 03:22:02,804
“Well, Fremont County owes it to Jake.”

3895
03:22:02,804 --> 03:22:05,400
And I left him interested
in the local news.

3896
03:22:05,400 --> 03:22:08,564
Dead men I have seen not a few times,
even some lying pale and terrible after

3897
03:22:08,564 --> 03:22:13,385
violent ends, and the edge of this wears
off; but I hope I shall never again have

3898
03:22:13,385 --> 03:22:15,585
to be in the company with men
waiting to be killed.

3899
03:22:15,585 --> 03:22:18,985
By this time tomorrow the gray flannel
shirt would be buttoned round a corpse.

3900
03:22:18,985 --> 03:22:21,316
Until what moment would Steve chew?

3901
03:22:21,316 --> 03:22:25,276
Against such fancies as these I managed
presently to barricade my mind,

3902
03:22:25,276 --> 03:22:30,029
but I made a plea to be allowed to pass
the night elsewhere,

3903
03:22:30,029 --> 03:22:33,322
and I suggested the adjacent cabin.

3904
03:22:33,322 --> 03:22:36,562
By their faces I saw that my words merely
helped their distrust of me.

3905
03:22:36,562 --> 03:22:40,655
The cabin leaked too much,
they said; I would sleep drier here.

3906
03:22:40,655 --> 03:22:44,102
One man gave it to me more directly:
“If you figured on camping in this

3907
03:22:44,102 --> 03:22:45,865
stable, what has changed your mind?”

3908
03:22:45,865 --> 03:22:49,629
How could I tell them that I shrunk from
any contact with what they were doing,

3909
03:22:49,629 --> 03:22:53,002
although I knew that only so could
justice be dealt in this country?

3910
03:22:53,002 --> 03:22:57,448
Their wholesome frontier nerves knew
nothing of such refinements.

3911
03:22:57,448 --> 03:23:00,171
But the Virginian understood part of it.

3912
03:23:00,171 --> 03:23:02,528
“I am right sorry for
your annoyance,” he said.

3913
03:23:02,528 --> 03:23:06,419
And now I noticed he was under a
constraint very different from the

3914
03:23:06,419 --> 03:23:08,110
ease of the others.

3915
03:23:08,110 --> 03:23:11,550
After the twelve hours’ ride my bones
were hungry for rest.

3916
03:23:11,550 --> 03:23:17,461
I spread my blankets on some straw in a
stall by myself and rolled up in them;

3917
03:23:17,461 --> 03:23:21,956
yet I lay growing broader awake,
every inch of weariness stricken

3918
03:23:21,956 --> 03:23:24,144
from my excited senses.

3919
03:23:24,144 --> 03:23:27,016
For a while they sat over their councils,
whispering cautiously,

3920
03:23:27,016 --> 03:23:31,016
so that I was made curious to hear them
by not being able; was it the names of

3921
03:23:31,016 --> 03:23:36,969
Trampas and Shorty that were once or
twice spoken⁠—I could not be sure.

3922
03:23:36,969 --> 03:23:39,972
I heard the whisperers cease and separate.

3923
03:23:39,972 --> 03:23:43,800
I heard their boots as they cast them
off upon the ground.

3924
03:23:43,800 --> 03:23:48,865
And I heard the breathing of slumber
begin and grow in the interior silence.

3925
03:23:48,865 --> 03:23:52,465
To one after one sleep came,
but not to me.

3926
03:23:52,465 --> 03:23:56,064
Outside, the dull fall of the rain beat
evenly, and in some angle dripped the

3927
03:23:56,064 --> 03:23:58,785
spouting pulses of a leak.

3928
03:23:58,785 --> 03:24:03,119
Sometimes a cold air blew in,
bearing with it the keen wet

3929
03:24:03,119 --> 03:24:05,650
odor of the sagebrush.

3930
03:24:05,650 --> 03:24:09,893
On hundreds of other nights this perfume
had been my last waking remembrance;

3931
03:24:09,893 --> 03:24:15,924
it had seemed to help drowsiness;
and now I lay staring, thinking of this.

3932
03:24:15,924 --> 03:24:19,339
Twice through the hours the thieves
shifted their positions with clumsy

3933
03:24:19,339 --> 03:24:22,278
sounds, exchanging muted
words with their guard.

3934
03:24:22,278 --> 03:24:26,020
So, often, had I heard other companions
move and mutter in the darkness

3935
03:24:26,020 --> 03:24:28,476
and lie down again.

3936
03:24:28,476 --> 03:24:32,680
It was the very naturalness and usualness
of every fact of the night⁠—the stable

3937
03:24:32,680 --> 03:24:35,120
straw, the rain outside,
my familiar blankets,

3938
03:24:35,120 --> 03:24:40,178
the cool visits of the wind⁠—and with
all this the thought of Steve chewing

3939
03:24:40,178 --> 03:24:43,980
and the man in the gray flannel shirt,
that made the hours unearthly and strung

3940
03:24:43,980 --> 03:24:45,218
me tight with suspense.

3941
03:24:45,218 --> 03:24:49,258
And at last I heard someone get up
and begin to dress.

3942
03:24:49,258 --> 03:24:53,181
In a little while I saw light suddenly
through my closed eyelids,

3943
03:24:53,181 --> 03:24:54,563
and then darkness shut
again abruptly upon them.

3944
03:24:54,563 --> 03:24:57,041
They had swung in a lantern and
found me by mistake.

3945
03:24:57,041 --> 03:24:59,121
I was the only one they did
not wish to rouse.

3946
03:24:59,121 --> 03:25:01,441
Moving and quiet talking set up around
me, and they began to go

3947
03:25:01,441 --> 03:25:02,079
out of the stable.
