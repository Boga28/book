00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,850
CHAPTER ONE
The Nursery

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:13,419
Wendy, John and Michael Darling live in a
lovely house in London.

3
00:00:13,419 --> 00:00:16,279
They have got a big, sunny nursery.

4
00:00:16,279 --> 00:00:22,010
There are colourful pictures and a big clock
on the wall.

5
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:25,140
There are toys here and there.

6
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,730
The Darlings are a happy family.

7
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:35,780
Mr Darling and Mrs Darling love their children
very much.

8
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:42,880
Wendy is the first child, John is the second
and Michael is the third.

9
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:51,050
The children's nanny is called Nana and she
is a big Newfoundland dog!

10
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:56,180
Her kennel is in the nursery and she is a
wonderful nanny.

11
00:00:56,180 --> 00:01:01,140
She loves the children and the children love
her.

12
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:06,500
One evening Mr and Mrs Darling want to go
to a dinner party.

13
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,280
They have their best clothes on.

14
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:15,340
'Nana, it's time to put the children to bed,'
says Mrs Darling.

15
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:17,750
Nana goes to the bathroom.

16
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:24,110
She turns on the hot water for Michael's bath.

17
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:27,920
She puts her paw in the water to check the
temperature.

18
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,000
It's perfect!

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,120
'I don't want to have a bath!' says little
Michael.

20
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:39,900
But Nana is a firm nanny and Michael has his
bath.

21
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,150
Then Nana gives the children their pyjamas.

22
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:46,560
Now they are ready for bed.

23
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,160
Mrs Darling comes into the nursery and smiles.

24
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,740
'Good work, Nana!

25
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:55,340
I see the children are ready for bed.'

26
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:58,400
Nana wags her big tail.

27
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,100
Suddenly there is a noise.

28
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:05,200
Mrs Darling sees a young boy outside the nursery
window.

29
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,970
She is very surprised.

30
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:14,970
Nana barks and shuts the window quickly.

31
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:18,890
The boy's shadow falls on the floor.

32
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:21,210
The young boy flies away.

33
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:25,090
'Who's there?' asks Mrs Darling.

34
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:30,920
She opens the window and looks outside, but
she sees nothing.

35
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:38,150
Then she sees the boy's shadow on the floor
and says, 'Poor boy, this is his shadow.

36
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:40,940
Let's put it in the drawer.'

37
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:43,560
The children are in bed.

38
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,760
Mr Darling takes Nana to the garden.

39
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:52,150
Then he goes to the sitting room and waits
for Mrs Darling.

40
00:02:52,150 --> 00:03:02,440
Mrs Darling sings to the children and kisses
them.

41
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,790
She is a perfect mother.

42
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:08,220
Soon the three children are sleeping.

43
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:11,260
Mr and Mrs Darling go to their bedroom.

44
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:17,030
They put on their coats and go to the dinner
party.

45
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:24,640
CHAPTER TWO
The Shadow

46
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,270
The children are sleeping and dreaming.

47
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:31,730
Suddenly the window opens.

48
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:39,610
A small ball of light enters the nursery and
flies around.

49
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:43,920
It is a lovely fairy called Tinker Bell.

50
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,819
She is looking for something.

51
00:03:45,819 --> 00:03:54,870
After a moment a young boy enters the nursery
and says, 'Tink, where are you?

52
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:57,020
Please find my shadow.'

53
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:01,750
Tinker Bell finds his shadow in the drawer
and gives it to him.

54
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:06,590
'Now I can stick the shadow to my feet with
some soap,' he thinks.

55
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:10,209
He tries and tries again, but he can't.

56
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:15,760
He is very confused and starts crying.

57
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,280
Wendy wakes up and sees the boy but she is
not afraid.

58
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,750
His clothes are made of leaves.

59
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:27,350
'Little boy, why are you crying?'

60
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,960
Wendy asks.

61
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:34,290
The boy takes off his cap and asks, 'What's
your name?'

62
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:37,220
'Wendy Moira Angela Darling.

63
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:38,680
What's yours?'

64
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,150
'Peter Pan.'

65
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:42,350
'Is that all?'

66
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:44,550
'Yes!' says Peter.

67
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:50,200
Then he thinks, 'My name is very, very short.'

68
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:55,850
Wendy looks at his shadow and asks, 'Can I
help you with your shadow?'

69
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:58,640
'Yes, please!' says Peter.

70
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:03,650
Wendy gets her sewing basket and sews on Peter's
shadow.

71
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:07,250
After a few minutes she says, 'Finished!

72
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,540
Now you have your shadow again.'

73
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:14,400
Peter looks at the floor and sees his shadow.

74
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:22,300
He is very happy and dances around the room.

75
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:31,330
'Oh, Wendy, you are wonderful!' says Peter.

76
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:35,770
'Do you really think so?' asks Wendy.

77
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:37,470
'Yes,' says Peter.

78
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:41,139
Wendy smiles and gives Peter a kiss on the
cheek.

79
00:05:41,139 --> 00:05:43,370
'Oh!' says Peter.

80
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:44,860
'How nice!'

81
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:48,910
'How old are you, Peter?' asks Wendy.

82
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:52,650
'I don't know, but I am young.

83
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:54,700
I don't want to grow up.

84
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:58,260
I always want to be a boy and have fun.'

85
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:06,449
Peter looks around the room for his fairy.

86
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:10,000
He hears a noise and looks in a drawer.

87
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,270
Tinker Bell flies out.

88
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:17,460
Wendy is delighted to see a fairy, but Tinker
Bell is afraid.

89
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,970
She hides behind the big clock.

90
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:27,400
'Where do you live, Peter?' asks Wendy.

91
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:32,100
'I live in Neverland with the Lost Boys,'
says Peter.

92
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,100
'Neverland?

93
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,790
The Lost Boys?

94
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:37,930
Who are they?' asks Wendy.

95
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:41,780
'The Lost Boys haven't got a mother or father.

96
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:45,070
They are alone in the world and they live
in Neverland.

97
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:47,500
I am their Captain.

98
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,590
In Neverland we fight the pirates.

99
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:54,889
We also swim in the lagoon with the beautiful
mermaids.

100
00:06:54,889 --> 00:06:57,310
Fairies live in the trees in the forest.

101
00:06:57,310 --> 00:07:00,370
The fairies are my friends,' says Peter.

102
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:03,650
'Oh, what fun!' says Wendy.

103
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:06,060
'I must go back now.

104
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:08,740
I must tell the Lost Boys a story.

105
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:11,060
They love stories,' says Peter.

106
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,560
'Don't go away!

107
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,150
I know a lot of stories,' says Wendy.

108
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:18,400
'Then come with me, Wendy.

109
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,600
You can tell us stories.

110
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,610
We all want a mother.

111
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:24,350
Please come,' says Peter.

112
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:27,770
'But I can't fly,' says Wendy.

113
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:32,010
'I can teach you to fly,' says Peter.

114
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:38,350
'Can you teach John and Michael to fly too?'

115
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:39,400
'Yes, of course,' says Peter.

116
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,400
'John!

117
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,400
Michael!

118
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,400
Wake up!

119
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,400
This is Peter Pan.

120
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,400
He's from Neverland.

121
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,419
It's a beautiful place,' says Wendy.

122
00:07:47,419 --> 00:07:49,770
John and Michael are very surprised.

123
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:52,800
'We can go there with him.

124
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,250
But first we must learn to fly,' Wendy says.

125
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:02,280
Wendy, John and Michael are very excited.

126
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:06,490
They try to fly but fall on the beds and on
the floor.

127
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:09,520
'No, no,' says Peter.

128
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,540
'Here is some fairy dust.'

129
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:16,120
He puts some fairy dust on their shoulders.

130
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,570
'Now try again,' says Peter.

131
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:22,370
'Look, I can fly!' says Wendy.

132
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:25,530
'I can too,' says John.

133
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:28,460
'Me too,' says little Michael.

134
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:33,430
'Tink, show us the way to Neverland,' says
Peter.

135
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:37,439
They follow Tinker Bell and fly out of the
nursery window.

136
00:08:37,439 --> 00:08:45,759
In the garden Nana looks at the sky and barks.

137
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:49,600
Mr and Mrs Darling return from the dinner
party.

138
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,929
They go into the nursery, but it is empty!

139
00:08:54,929 --> 00:08:59,980
CHAPTER THREE
The Neverland

140
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:13,119
Wendy, John and Michael fly over cities, towns,
mountains, forests and seas.

141
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:16,730
Finally they see an island in the sea below
them.

142
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:20,769
'Look, that's Neverland,' says Peter.

143
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:21,769
'Neverland!'

144
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:24,360
say the children.

145
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:32,120
In Neverland the Lost Boys live in the forest
in a secret underground home.

146
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:42,420
There are six Lost Boys: Slightly Soiled,
Tootles, Nibs, Curly and the Twins.

147
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:45,490
They are waiting for Peter.

148
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:48,800
Suddenly they hear the voices of the pirates.

149
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,779
Nibs is very brave.

150
00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:58,350
He goes out, hides behind a tree and looks
around him.

151
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:01,170
He sees the horrible pirates.

152
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:03,679
They are walking in the forest.

153
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:06,999
They are big and ugly.

154
00:10:06,999 --> 00:10:12,029
Their pirate ship is the Jolly Roger.

155
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:15,860
The pirates' captain is James Hook.

156
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:20,720
He is a cruel pirate and a very bad man.

157
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:26,940
He's got black eyes, black hair and a black
beard.

158
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:29,570
He hates Peter Pan.

159
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:32,129
He's only got one arm.

160
00:10:32,129 --> 00:10:35,209
The other is a hook!

161
00:10:35,209 --> 00:10:41,660
In the past Peter Pan cut off Captain Hook's
right arm during a fight.

162
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:44,989
A crocodile ate the arm.

163
00:10:44,989 --> 00:10:51,489
Now the crocodile follows Captain Hook everywhere
because he wants to eat him.

164
00:10:51,489 --> 00:10:56,279
The crocodile has an alarm clock in its stomach!

165
00:10:56,279 --> 00:10:59,149
Captain Hook can always hear it.

166
00:10:59,149 --> 00:11:03,050
'I know the Lost Boys live in this forest.

167
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:06,869
We must find them and Peter Pan!' says Captain
Hook.

168
00:11:06,869 --> 00:11:09,389
'Tick, tock, tick, tock!'

169
00:11:09,389 --> 00:11:11,629
Captain Hook hears the alarm clock.

170
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:16,769
'Oh, no, the crocodile is coming to eat me!'
says Captain Hook.

171
00:11:16,769 --> 00:11:21,329
He runs away and the pirates follow him.

172
00:11:21,329 --> 00:11:25,550
Soon some Indians arrive in the forest.

173
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:28,209
They are looking for the pirates.

174
00:11:28,209 --> 00:11:31,100
The pirates are their enemy.

175
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,939
Tiger Lily is their leader.

176
00:11:33,939 --> 00:11:37,890
She is the beautiful daughter of the Indian
chief.

177
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:40,860
She loves Peter Pan.

178
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:44,420
Tinker Bell and Wendy love him too.

179
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:51,269
The Indians go away and the Lost Boys return
to play in the forest.

180
00:11:51,269 --> 00:11:59,339
Then Nibs looks at the sky and says, 'Look,
there is a lovely white bird in the sky.'

181
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:05,249
'Is it really a bird?' the Lost Boys ask.

182
00:12:05,249 --> 00:12:09,040
Tinker Bell says, 'Yes, yes, it's a bird.

183
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,970
It's a Wendy bird.

184
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:12,910
You must shoot it!'

185
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:16,660
Sometimes Tink is a bad fairy.

186
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:21,920
She knows it is Wendy, but she doesn't like
her.

187
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:26,939
Nibs takes his bow and arrow and shoots Wendy.

188
00:12:26,939 --> 00:12:30,319
Poor Wendy falls to the ground.

189
00:12:30,319 --> 00:12:34,910
The Lost Boys see Wendy and say, 'She's not
a bird!

190
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:37,879
She's a lovely girl.'

191
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:43,649
Peter flies down with John and Michael and
asks, 'Where is Wendy?'

192
00:12:43,649 --> 00:12:47,970
Tootles says, 'Here she is.'

193
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:53,839
Peter goes over to her and asks, 'Wendy, are
you all right?'

194
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,720
Wendy slowly opens her eyes and smiles.

195
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:03,040
'Yes, but I'm very tired,' she says.

196
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,110
The Lost Boys are sorry.

197
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:08,889
They decide to build her a little house.

198
00:13:08,889 --> 00:13:14,399
When the house is ready Wendy says, 'What
a lovely little house!

199
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:15,549
Thank you.'

200
00:13:15,549 --> 00:13:17,220
'Can you be our mother now?

201
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:22,649
Can you tell us bedtime stories before we
go to bed?' asks Nibs.

202
00:13:22,649 --> 00:13:25,549
'Of course,' says Wendy.

203
00:13:25,549 --> 00:13:29,339
'Come in and I can tell you the story of Cinderella.'

204
00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:35,529
They enter, sit down and listen to Wendy's
story.

205
00:13:35,529 --> 00:13:38,379
It is a wonderful story.

206
00:13:38,379 --> 00:13:41,850
Peter Pan is outside the house with his sword.

207
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:47,050
He wants to protect Wendy and the Lost Boys.

208
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:57,509
CHAPTER FOUR
The Mermaid's Lagoon

209
00:13:57,509 --> 00:14:08,699
One summer evening Peter, Wendy, John, Michael
and the Lost Boys go to the Mermaid's Lagoon.

210
00:14:08,699 --> 00:14:12,860
Beautiful mermaids live here and they are
Peter's friends.

211
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:17,249
They swim and play in the blue lagoon.

212
00:14:17,249 --> 00:14:22,720
Then they sit on Marooner's Rock to comb their
long hair.

213
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,170
They sit in the sun and laugh.

214
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:31,980
The children like the mermaids and John says,
'I want to catch one!'

215
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:36,259
He tries, but the mermaid jumps into the water.

216
00:14:36,259 --> 00:14:43,220
Peter says, 'It is very difficult to catch
a mermaid.'

217
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:47,389
Suddenly someone says, 'Look, the pirates
are coming!'

218
00:14:47,389 --> 00:14:51,879
A small boat with two pirates is coming to
the lagoon.

219
00:14:51,879 --> 00:15:01,000
John, Michael and the Lost Boys jump off the
rock and swim away.

220
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,389
But Wendy stays with Peter.

221
00:15:03,389 --> 00:15:06,420
They hide behind the rock.

222
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:08,529
Peter sees Tiger Lily.

223
00:15:08,529 --> 00:15:10,939
She is sitting in the small boat.

224
00:15:10,939 --> 00:15:15,000
Poor Tiger Lily is a prisoner of the pirates.

225
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,730
'Let's leave her on this rock.

226
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:20,509
When the sea rises, she will die!' says Smee.

227
00:15:20,509 --> 00:15:24,869
The two pirates laugh.

228
00:15:24,869 --> 00:15:28,910
It is already night and it is very dark.

229
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:33,059
Peter wants to save Tiger Lily and thinks
of something intelligent.

230
00:15:33,059 --> 00:15:38,720
He imitates Captain Hook's voice and says,
'Cut the ropes and let her go!

231
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,839
Do as I say, you idiots!

232
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:42,149
Let her go!'

233
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:44,799
The two pirates are amazed.

234
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:47,250
'Can you hear Hook's voice?' asks Smee.

235
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:49,990
'Yes, but what do we do?' asks Starkey.

236
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:54,139
'We must obey him and cut the ropes,' says
Smee.

237
00:15:54,139 --> 00:16:01,220
They cut the ropes and Tiger Lily is free.

238
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:05,029
She quickly jumps into the water and swims
away.

239
00:16:05,029 --> 00:16:09,470
Captain Hook sees everything and he is furious.

240
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:12,019
'That horrid Peter Pan!

241
00:16:12,019 --> 00:16:14,850
This time I must attack him,' he says.

242
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:19,919
He swims to the rock and fights with Peter.

243
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:21,609
It is a long fight.

244
00:16:21,609 --> 00:16:27,949
The Captain hurts Peter with his hook, but
Peter fights courageously.

245
00:16:27,949 --> 00:16:34,709
At last, Peter wins the fight and Hook swims
back to the Jolly Roger.

246
00:16:34,709 --> 00:16:37,399
Peter is now alone on the rock with Wendy.

247
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:41,180
'The sea is rising and we are in great danger
here.

248
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:44,199
We must leave this rock,' says Peter.

249
00:16:44,199 --> 00:16:49,740
'Oh, Peter, I am very tired and I cannot swim
or fly.'

250
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:52,759
He sees a big kite with a long tail.

251
00:16:52,759 --> 00:16:56,160
It is flying slowly over the lagoon.

252
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:02,209
He takes the tail of the kite and says, 'Wendy,
hold on to this tail and fly away with the

253
00:17:02,209 --> 00:17:03,209
kite.'

254
00:17:03,209 --> 00:17:04,280
Wendy flies away.

255
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,930
'The sea is rising.

256
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:09,390
I must fly away,' Peter thinks.

257
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:16,900
When he gets home everyone is happy to see
him especially Wendy.

258
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:24,810
CHAPTER FIVE
The Underground Home

259
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:28,990
The Underground Home is a secret place.

260
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:31,260
No one knows where it is.

261
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:34,440
It is a happy, warm place.

262
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:38,680
There is only one room with a big fireplace.

263
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:42,620
Tinker Bell has her tiny room too.

264
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:45,380
Wendy is a perfect mother.

265
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:49,130
She cooks and sews for everyone.

266
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:53,410
She also tells beautiful bedtime stories.

267
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:59,070
The Lost Boys are happy because they finally
have a mother.

268
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:05,460
John and Michael are happy because there is
a new adventure every day. 

269
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,650
Peter Pan is a perfect father.

270
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:14,430
He brings home food and protects the family.

271
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:20,540
Wendy and Peter play with the children and
laugh with them.

272
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:23,920
But one night something happens.

273
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:26,950
Wendy tells the children this bedtime story:

274
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:31,760
'In the big city of London there are two parents.

275
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:36,090
They are very sad because they cannot find
their three children.

276
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:40,110
Every night they leave the nursery window
open.

277
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:44,530
They wait and wait for their children to return.

278
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:46,400
But they don't return.

279
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,640
Poor parents!

280
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,830
They are very sad without their children.'

281
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:56,300
'Oh, Wendy, this is the story of our parents,'
says John.

282
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:59,620
'Yes, it is,' says Michael.

283
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:04,930
Peter listens and says, 'Sometimes parents
forget their children and other children take

284
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:05,930
their place.'

285
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:07,470
Wendy is very surprised.

286
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:08,470
'Oh, no!'

287
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:09,470
she says!

288
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:13,390
'Perhaps there are other children in our beds!

289
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:16,300
John, Michael we must go home!'

290
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:19,750
'Do we really have to?'

291
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:20,980
ask John and Michael.

292
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:24,720
'Yes, we've got to return home.'

293
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:31,040
The Lost Boys are sad and say, 'Oh, Wendy,
please don't leave us!'

294
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,590
'Don't be sad.

295
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:38,240
You can come and live with us in London,'
says Wendy.

296
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,780
'Oh, how wonderful!'

297
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,470
the Lost Boys say.

298
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:45,110
'We can have a real family.'

299
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:47,460
They jump up and down with joy.

300
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,730
They dance around the room.

301
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,930
But Peter is not happy.

302
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:56,940
He is very serious and says, 'I'm not coming
with you to London.

303
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,990
I don't want to grow up.

304
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:01,360
I want to be a boy forever.'

305
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,910
Everyone says goodbye to Peter.

306
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:09,030
Outside, the pirates are waiting for them!

307
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:14,060
The children come out of the underground home
and the pirates capture them.

308
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:16,610
Then they take them to the Jolly Roger.

309
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:19,020
They don't make any noise.

310
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:21,590
Peter doesn't know where they are.

311
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:26,450
He is sad without Wendy, John, Michael and
the Lost Boys.

312
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:28,600
He sits and thinks.

313
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,520
'Tap, tap, tap!'

314
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,290
There is someone at the door.

315
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:35,590
'Who is it?' asks Peter.

316
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:43,410
He can hear the sound of little bells and
opens the door.

317
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:50,030
Tinker Bell flies in and says, 'The pirates
have got Wendy, John, Michael and the Lost

318
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:51,030
Boys!

319
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:52,030
They are in danger.

320
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:53,620
Let's help them!'

321
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:56,300
'I must save them.

322
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:59,660
Come Tink, let's go to the Jolly Roger!

323
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:06,250
This time I must attack Hook!'

324
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:11,470
CHAPTER SIX
The Jolly Roger

325
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:14,700
There is a yellow moon in the night sky.

326
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:18,560
The folly Roger is in the bay near Kidd's
Creek.

327
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:22,110
The children are on the pirate ship.

328
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:27,230
They are prisoners of Captain Hook and his
cruel pirates.

329
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:32,110
Captain Hook looks at them and says, 'This
time it's Peter Pan or me!

330
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:33,170
You idiots!

331
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:35,220
Peter Pan can't save you now.'

332
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:38,870
Hook laughs and then calls Smee.

333
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:40,960
'Smee, get the plank ready!'

334
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,440
'Yes sir!' says Smee.

335
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,790
'Now listen to me,' says Hook.

336
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:47,960
'You must all walk the plank!'

337
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,960
'Walk the plank?'

338
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:50,960
asks John.

339
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,960
'Yes!

340
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:56,530
First you walk the plank and then you fall
into the sea with the crocodile.

341
00:21:56,530 --> 00:21:57,800
It will eat you!

342
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,610
Ha, ha!' laughs Hook.

343
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:02,080
'But I can save two of you.

344
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,600
I want two young pirates.

345
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,950
Who wants to be a pirate?'

346
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:09,340
The Lost Boys look at John.

347
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:14,230
John looks at Michael and says, 'The life
of a pirate is exciting.

348
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:16,240
I don't want to walk the plank.

349
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,810
I don't want to be food for the crocodile.

350
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:21,220
Let's be pirates!'

351
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:23,300
Michael looks at his brother.

352
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,470
Then they look at Wendy.

353
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:28,800
She doesn't like their idea.

354
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:32,130
Captain Hook laughs and moves his hook in
front of their faces.

355
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:36,580
'Do you want to be pirates, yes or no?' he
asks.

356
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:40,370
John and Michael say, 'Never!'

357
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:45,770
Captain Hook is angry and says, 'Then you
must walk the plank and die!'

358
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:47,500
Wendy is afraid.

359
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,270
She loves her brothers and the Lost Boys.

360
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:53,060
She has tears in her eyes.

361
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:57,780
The boys stand near the plank and Wendy watches
them.

362
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:01,730
A pirate asks, 'Who is the first to walk the
plank?'

363
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:04,830
At that moment there is a loud noise.

364
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:05,830
'Tick!

365
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:06,830
Tock!

366
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:07,830
Tick!

367
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:08,830
Tock!'

368
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:09,830
Captain Hook's face is white.

369
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:12,090
He says, 'The crocodile is here.

370
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:14,550
He wants ME!'

371
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:19,570
He runs to his cabin and hides there.

372
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:21,620
'Who is the first to walk the plank?'

373
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:22,620
asks a pirate.

374
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:23,620
'Come on!

375
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:24,620
Let's go!

376
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:25,880
The crocodile is hungry.'

377
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:29,750
Suddenly Peter Pan appears on the pirate ship.

378
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:31,940
Tinker Bell follows him.

379
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:35,220
Wendy and the boys cheer.

380
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:38,760
They are very happy to see their young hero.

381
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:41,640
Hook and his pirates are furious.

382
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:45,390
Hook takes his sword and says, 'I want to
fight you, Pan!

383
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:49,710
Tonight you will die!'

384
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:53,740
Hook fights with his long sword and with his
hook.

385
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:55,350
Peter fights courageously.

386
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:58,800
He pushes Hook to the back of the ship.

387
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,120
It is a terrible fight.

388
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:05,020
John, Michael and the Lost Boys fight the
pirates.

389
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:13,770
After a long fight they throw the pirates
into the sea.

390
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:17,270
Peter and Hook move all around the big ship.

391
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:20,580
Their swords make a loud noise.

392
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:28,430
Suddenly Peter takes Hook's sword and pushes
him into the sea!

393
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:31,040
Hook shouts, 'OH, NO!'

394
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:35,540
He falls into the sea and into the mouth of
the hungry crocodile.

395
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:42,130
'Oh, Peter, we are proud of you!' says Wendy.

396
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:44,890
She kisses him on the cheek.

397
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:48,970
The boys cheer.

398
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:53,490
Peter smiles and says, 'The Jolly Roger is
ours now.

399
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:58,900
Let's go home!' 

400
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:04,140
CHAPTER SEVEN
Home at Last!

401
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:10,990
At the Darling home, Mr and Mrs Darling and
Nana are desolate.

402
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:15,310
They always think about Wendy, John and Michael.

403
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:21,660
They look at the three empty beds and tears
come to their eyes.

404
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:27,450
Mr and Mrs Darling never smile or laugh anymore.

405
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:36,360
Mrs Darling sits in the silent nursery and
cries.

406
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:43,270
She thinks of her children, their games and
their happy voices.

407
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:49,580
Nana tries to comfort her, but nothing can
make Mrs Darling happy. 

408
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:54,970
One night after several months something incredible
happens.

409
00:25:54,970 --> 00:26:00,590
Wendy, John and Michael fly in to the nursery.

410
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:03,370
Mrs Darling is sitting near the fireplace.

411
00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:08,060
'Mother, Mother we're home!' says Wendy.

412
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:13,110
Mrs Darling turns around and sees her three
dear children.

413
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:17,640
'Is this true or is it a dream?

414
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:20,070
I can't believe it!'

415
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:21,070
she says.

416
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:25,780
'Oh, Mother, we are home at last,' the children
say.

417
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:30,690
Wendy, John and Michael embrace their mother
and kiss her.

418
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:35,350
'How wonderful to see you, my dear children!

419
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:38,630
How wonderful to hear your sweet voices.

420
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:41,120
Oh, let me look at you!'

421
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,230
She calls Mr Darling.

422
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:46,730
Mr Darling is very happy and surprised.

423
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:49,640
There is great joy in the Darling nursery
tonight.

424
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:56,090
'Mother,' says Wendy, 'Peter Pan and the Lost
Boys are here too.

425
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:58,130
They are waiting outside.'

426
00:26:58,130 --> 00:27:03,300
The six Lost Boys slowly enter the nursery.

427
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:07,070
They look at Mrs Darling and smile at her.

428
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:09,940
'Mother, these are the Lost Boys.

429
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:11,840
They haven't got a mother.

430
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,750
Can they stay with us?' says Wendy.

431
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:18,360
'What dear little boys!' says Mrs Darling.

432
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:21,590
'Of course they can stay with us.

433
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:24,740
And where is Peter Pan?'

434
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:31,330
Peter enters the nursery and says, 'I am here,
but I don't want to stay here.

435
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:35,280
I don't want to go to school and I don't want
to grow up!

436
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,900
I want to be a young boy forever.

437
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:40,010
I must return to Neverland.

438
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:43,520
I am happy with the Indians and the fairies.'

439
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:48,730
Wendy is surprised and says, 'But Peter, when
will I see you again?'

440
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:52,230
Mrs Darling says, 'I have an idea.

441
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:55,820
Wendy, you can visit Peter in Neverland every
spring!

442
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:58,420
You can stay there for a week.'

443
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:03,520
'Can I really go to Neverland every spring,
Mother?' asks Wendy.

444
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:07,680
Peter looks at Mrs Darling and asks, 'Is that
a promise?'

445
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:10,750
'Of course it is,' says Mrs Darling.

446
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:14,520
'Then I want spring to come quickly,' says
Peter.

447
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:17,470
'Yes, very quickly,' says Wendy.

448
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:19,390
'Come on, Tink!

449
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:22,870
Let's fly home and wait for spring,' says
Peter.

450
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:29,760
Peter Pan and Tinker Bell fly out of the nursery
window into the night sky.

451
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:34,460
Their destination?

452
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:36,820
Neverland!

453
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:51,860
- THE END -
