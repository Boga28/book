1
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:15,040
Marrying a man who already has children makes 
you a stepmother, a difficult part to play  

2
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:21,520
in a family. And stepmothers in stories are 
often mean and unkind to their stepchildren.

3
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:30,800
Lakshman, who is nine, knows this very 
well. He never wanted a stepmother. Why  

4
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:43,840
ever did his father marry her? Maybe if he 
is horrible to her, she will go away again...

5
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:06,480
Lakshman ran his hand over the surface of the 
cupboard and breathed in the pleasant smell of  

6
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:19,200
newly cut wood. An almirah, with four doors, two 
above and two below, and a shiny key in each one -  

7
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:26,960
what use was an almirah to a baby! Nobody 
ever made almirahs with four doors!

8
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:34,800
Carefully he turned the keys 
to look inside. In one half,  

9
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:44,880
there was a place to hang clothes - small clothes. 
The other half had narrow shelves. Underneath,  

10
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:52,400
there were two long, wide shelves. Somebody - she, 
he supposed - had already put some toys there,  

11
00:01:53,040 --> 00:02:00,240
baby things, plastic cups that fit into each 
other, little wooden bricks, and coloured balls.  

12
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,360
Angrily he banged the doors 
shut. What a complete waste!

13
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:12,000
In his bare feet he walked down the 
stairs to the back of the house,  

14
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:19,200
to the kitchen area. The old Amme was squatting 
on the floor, cutting up vegetables for the meal.  

15
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:28,160
A row of pots and pans stood on the floor, and 
Kandy, the Alsatian dog, was sleeping peacefully  

16
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:36,880
beside them, his tail occasionally waving away 
the flies. Both Lakshman and the Amme knew this  

17
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:43,840
was against the rules - the rules the new woman 
had made after she took control of the house.  

18
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:52,320
But they understood each other, the old cook 
and the boy. He squatted down opposite her,  

19
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:59,760
watching her. Although he was nine 
he was small for his age - small,  

20
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:06,640
but strong. He wore an old shirt and a 
too-small pair of washed-out blue trousers.

21
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,840
For some time he watched the Amme in silence.  

22
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:19,360
Then, in his rather high little-boy's voice, 
he asked, 'Where is the bloody woman?'

23
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:27,840
The Amme did not stop her cutting. She said 
calmly, 'She's getting dressed to go out.  

24
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,680
She wants you to change and go with 
her. To buy new shoes for school.'

25
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:41,440
The boy sighed. He picked up a piece 
of sugarcane and began to suck it  

26
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:49,040
noisily. That was really too bad! Did 
she really think he'd go out with her,  

27
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:56,080
walk in the street where all his friends would 
see him? True, his father had said she would help  

28
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:02,640
him and look after him. But that did not mean 
she could give him orders, or that he had to do  

29
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:09,440
what she wanted. Why, he wouldn't go with her for 
anything - not even if she offered him a bicycle.

30
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:17,200
Lakshman had been saving for a bicycle for 
some time. His weekly money from his father,  

31
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:25,120
gifts from aunts and uncles and grandparents, 
all this was carefully saved. In fact  

32
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:32,880
Lakshman lived for the day when there would 
be enough for that bicycle. But dislike of  

33
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:41,440
his stepmother was so great that he could not even 
imagine himself accepting a bicycle from her. He  

34
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:48,480
bit off a piece of sugarcane and said crossly, 'I 
am not going out with her to buy a pair of shoes.'

35
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:56,400
It was hot in the kitchen. The Amme 
lifted a corner of the cotton cloth she  

36
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:02,160
was wearing wrapped round her like a skirt, 
and wiped the sweat from her face and neck.

37
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:11,440
At that moment Lakshman's stepmother appeared 
in the doorway. Her eyes took in the scene  

38
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:20,000
and narrowed angrily. She raised her voice 
and said, 'Amme, I have told you again  

39
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,400
and again not to cut vegetables on the 
floor,' and then to Lakshman, 'Lakshman,  

40
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,800
go and change your clothes. I want to 
take you out to buy a pair of shoes.'

41
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:41,680
Neither Amme nor the child moved. The Amme began 
to cut vegetables again, with great concentration.  

42
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:51,840
Lakshman looked quickly at his stepmother. The 
she-devil. Whatever had made his father marry her?

43
00:05:52,800 --> 00:06:02,400
He said, 'Amme doesn't understand English. And I 
don't want to go out. You buy the shoes for me.'

44
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:12,080
The woman straightened her back and looked down 
at him. 'If Amme doesn't understand English,  

45
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:19,120
why don't you tell her in Singhalese? And 
you say you won't come out with me... Well,  

46
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:25,440
I can't buy a pair of shoes unless you try 
them on. So please get ready. Quickly now.'

47
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,440
He turned to the Amme and said in Singhalese,  

48
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,160
'That bloody woman says not to 
cut vegetables on the floor.'

49
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:41,440
Very slowly and heavily the Amme 
got up from where she was squatting.  

50
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,560
She picked up the vegetables and 
threw them on the kitchen table.  

51
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:57,440
Then she said to the child, 'Tell her I can't work 
for her. Also I am not well. I have to go home.'  

52
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,080
Lakshman repeated in English 
exactly what the old cook

53
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:10,400
had said. The tall one looked from the 
child to the old woman a little helplessly,  

54
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,560
then shrugged her shoulders.

55
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,760
'If she is not feeling well, 
she must go home and get better.  

56
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:21,040
Meanwhile, you get ready. I am waiting.'

57
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,440
He stepped right in front of his stepmother;  

58
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:33,840
he had to bend his head far back in order to see 
her face. He collected the spit in his mouth,  

59
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:40,640
then walked slowly and deliberately to the corner 
of the kitchen where there was a space for washing  

60
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:49,840
vegetables, and spat. Spitting was the best 
way to drive away evil things. Then he said:

61
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:54,800
'But I told you. I am not coming.'

62
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:04,160
She took a deep breath. 'All right. If you 
are not coming, I am not buying the shoes.'  

63
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,160
She turned and walked towards the front door.

64
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,960
Lakshman ran after her and shouted 
so that it echoed down the road,  

65
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:20,400
'If you don't buy those shoes, I'll - I'll tell  

66
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:27,840
all the neighbours and relations what a mean, 
hateful, horrible stepmother you are...'

67
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:37,600
She didn't even turn her head. All she said 
was, 'You tell them whatever you like, Lakshman.  

68
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:44,880
But if you want a pair of shoes, you've got 
to come and try them on. Or else, no shoes.'

69
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:55,360
He watched her drive off. He was very angry, 
not because he needed the shoes so badly,  

70
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:02,720
but because he felt she had won this particular 
argument. He could hear the men servants talking  

71
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:08,960
and laughing loudly in the kitchen with the 
Amme, who was packing her things. They were  

72
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:16,080
talking about his stepmother. And 
suddenly a cold fury rose in him.

73
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,160
Why had she come here and upset things,  

74
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:26,400
when everything was running so smoothly 
before! And now the Amme was leaving...

75
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:34,880
Upstairs the baby began to cry. 
That was another thing - her baby.  

76
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:42,960
All that fuss and bother about him... you 
would think nobody had ever had a baby before.  

77
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:50,880
And all that nonsense about keeping him clean 
and not touching him with dirty fingers!  

78
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:59,040
And almirahs! Almirahs were bought 
for brides when they got married,  

79
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:04,320
to take to their new husband's house, 
to keep their saris and jewellery safe.

80
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,800
And then he had an idea.

81
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:19,680
Thoughtfully he climbed back up the stairs. There 
stood the almirah, with its smell of new wood.  

82
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:27,840
Without hesitating he opened the two bottom doors, 
which he could easily reach because they were at  

83
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:39,440
his height. He took hold of one door and forced 
it back further and further until the wood broke  

84
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:49,520
and the door fell to the ground with a loud crash. 
The second door soon followed the first. To reach  

85
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:57,760
the upper two doors, he got a chair and climbed 
on it. It was more difficult this time, but he  

86
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:04,560
pushed as hard as he could, until the third door 
landed on the ground with an even bigger crash.

87
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:11,520
He waited for a moment to see whether 
anyone would come to investigate,  

88
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:18,400
but he wasn't really worried. They 
- the servants - couldn't stop him.  

89
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:26,160
Wasn't he the young master? Anyway, 
they wouldn't want to stop him.  

90
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:34,640
Not at all. They'd be delighted with the trouble 
he was causing the new woman. He smiled nastily.  

91
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:46,320
Wouldn't she be wild! He imagined her 
return. This time she'd really get mad. She'd  

92
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:53,440
hit him and scream at him, and then his 
father would get rid of her, once and for all.

93
00:11:55,040 --> 00:12:02,800
With this happy thought he turned back to the 
almirah, and finally managed to break the fourth  

94
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:11,600
door off. Carefully he replaced the chair, and 
left the broken doors where they had fallen. Then  

95
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:17,920
he decided to play a game in his room. There would 
be enough time to hide when he heard the car.

96
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:28,160
She was coming up the stairs. Lakshman 
was lying flat on the floor of his room,  

97
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:35,120
looking through the narrow space under his door. 
He could hear the changing sound of her footsteps  

98
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:41,600
as she came higher and higher, and he 
held his breath when she finally stopped.

99
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:51,840
She stopped for quite some time. Then 
she called - not him, but the servant.

100
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:55,840
She asked, 'Who has done this, Somapala?'

101
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:06,640
Somapala, who had not seen the broken almirah 
before, gasped and said, 'I don't know.' There  

102
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:14,800
was another pause, and she said something Lakshman 
couldn't hear. Then she went into her bedroom.

103
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:23,440
That was too much for Lakshman. After all 
his hard work... He jumped up from the floor,  

104
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:31,120
ran through the doors, and burst into her room 
without knocking. She was standing by the mirror  

105
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,440
examining her face, and his 
eyes met hers in the mirror.

106
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,560
He screamed, 'You want to know who did it.  

107
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:51,360
Well, I did, I did it...' His face was 
red under the brown skin, and his eyes  

108
00:13:51,360 --> 00:14:00,080
very black, shining with the light of battle. His 
arms hung by his sides, his hands tightly closed.

109
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:12,560
She turned slowly. 'You did it, Lakshman? You?' 
She looked down at him from her great height.  

110
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:20,720
Her fingers were playing with the household 
keys she was holding. 'That's really too bad,  

111
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:27,120
Lakshman. Breaking the baby's cupboard. 
We had to pay a lot of money for it.'

112
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:35,360
He almost laughed. The stupid woman! What 
was the point in breaking something cheap?  

113
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,280
He waited for her fury to break,  

114
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:46,080
preparing himself for the punishment, 
looking forward to it almost with pleasure.

115
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:55,120
But it didn't come. She just stood 
there and looked at him calmly.  

116
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:00,640
Then she said, 'That's really too bad, Lakshman,  

117
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:10,000
I thought you were a sensible sort of boy.' She 
sighed. 'So now we have to ask the workman to  

118
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:17,280
repair the damage. Quite an unnecessary bother 
and cost.' She walked towards the baby's room.

119
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:25,840
Lakshman had a terrible feeling of disappointment, 
worse than he had ever experienced before.  

120
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:34,160
Wildly he ran after her and asked urgently, 
'But aren't you going to punish me?'

121
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:42,640
'Punish you?' She appeared 
surprised. 'Punish you? Oh, no.  

122
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,760
There's no point in that. Because 
that's what you want, isn't it?'  

123
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:55,520
She looked him straight in the eye. 'No, 
Lakshman. I am not going to punish you.  

124
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:05,040
Only...' She hesitated for a moment. 'About the 
repairs. You are going to pay for them, Lakshman.  

125
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:10,000
Out of your bicycle money. 
That's fair, don't you think?'

126
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:18,400
She opened the door of the baby's room, 
walked through, and firmly shut it behind her.

127
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:28,320
Lakshman stared at the closed door. The sun was 
shining outside and little gold bits of dust were  

128
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:37,040
dancing in the sunlight. The blood had left his 
face, and he stood there, wide-eyed and silent.  

129
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:45,440
Then he walked out of her room, past the 
four broken almirah doors on the floor,  

130
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:52,000
and down the stairs. His head 
was bent as he went slowly down,  

131
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:57,520
his old shirt hanging out over 
the too-small blue trousers.

132
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:05,440
He heard the door of the baby's room opening. 
The woman was looking down at him from the top  

133
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:11,440
of the stairs, but he pretended not to see, 
and continued going down without stopping.

134
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:21,680
She said, 'Lakshman?' Pause. 'Lakshman 
- we can come to an arrangement.'

135
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:28,560
He did not look up. But there was no 
longer any sharpness in her voice;  

136
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:34,960
instead, there was a warm note in it 
that the child did not fail to notice.

137
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:43,120
She said, 'You help the workman repair the 
cupboard, and I'll pay half the cost. Agreed?'

138
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,720
His eyes were hot with tears.  

139
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:56,160
'The bloody woman,' he whispered to 
himself. 'The bloody, bloody woman...'  

140
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:04,960
But he slowed down, and as he reached the bottom 
of the stairs, she heard him begin to whistle.

141
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:13,840
'Agreed,' he shouted, and ran
