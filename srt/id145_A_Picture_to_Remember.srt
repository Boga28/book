CHAPTER ONE
Cristina's motorbike

2
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:26,220
At eleven o'clock one morning the director
of the Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes in Buenos

3
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:32,439
Aires, Leonardo Martinez, asked Cristina Rinaldi
to come into his office.

4
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:38,870
'I want to talk to you about an important
job I'd like you to do, Cristina.

5
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:41,710
I think you'll be interested in it.'

6
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:43,960
'Of course.

7
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:44,960
What is it?'

8
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:51,390
'A museum in Paris wants to send some Impressionist
paintings to Buenos Aires.

9
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:57,739
I spoke to the Paris museum director, Philippe
Maudet, this morning and he's interested in

10
00:00:57,739 --> 00:01:01,430
using our museum to show the paintings.

11
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:03,770
It's an important job.

12
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:05,230
Would you like to do it?'

13
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:08,440
'Of course I would.

14
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,440
Great!

15
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:15,390
You know I'd love to see Impressionist paintings
here in the museum,' answered Cristina.

16
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:16,530
'Good.

17
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:22,120
I want you to begin work as soon as you can,'
the director said.

18
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:26,580
'There is a lot you'll need to do.'

19
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:29,180
Cristina felt good all day.

20
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:32,220
She loved Impressionist paintings.

21
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:35,130
This new exhibition was wonderful.

22
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:39,240
She couldn't wait to begin.

23
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:44,730
After work Cristina got onto her motorbike
outside the museum.

24
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:47,100
She was feeling good.

25
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:54,040
She had an important new job, the sun was
warm on her back and it was the start of spring

26
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:58,649
weather in the city of Buenos Aires.

27
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:03,369
Maybe tomorrow she could leave her jacket
at home.

28
00:02:03,369 --> 00:02:10,840
This year September was warm, and people were
already talking about a hot summer.

29
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:17,349
Cristina started her motorbike and felt the
warm air on her face as she rode along Avenida

30
00:02:17,349 --> 00:02:19,890
del Libertador.

31
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:25,980
She never wore a helmet because she liked
the feeling of the wind in her long hair.

32
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,739
But her father didn't know that.

33
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:35,230
She remembered his words when he gave her
the new motorbike: 'always wear your helmet,

34
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:39,739
Cristina - every time you ride!'

35
00:02:39,739 --> 00:02:44,910
She hoped her father would never see her without
it.

36
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:51,760
Every day at this time Cristina rode down
Avenida del Libertador to the gym at the Recoleta

37
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,819
Health Club.

38
00:02:53,819 --> 00:03:00,200
Her day's work at the museum was finished
and she was free.

39
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:04,060
She usually forgot about her work as she rode
down the Avenida.

40
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:07,620
But today was a little different.

41
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:12,000
She couldn't stop thinking about her new job.

42
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,610
Cristina began to slow down for the traffic
lights.

43
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:19,030
The traffic in the city center was terrible.

44
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:25,270
She didn't work far from the gym but the road
had so many traffic lights.

45
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:29,430
She stopped and looked into the car next to
her.

46
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:32,739
She saw two men in the car.

47
00:03:32,739 --> 00:03:35,350
She couldn't believe her eyes.

48
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:39,080
One of the men had a gun.

49
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:42,720
Then he looked out of the window at Cristina.

50
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:51,239
She looked into his eyes, into his dark brown
eyes and for a moment the man looked back.

51
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:59,680
Then he turned his head and she saw a tattoo
of a flower, a red poppy, on his neck.

52
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,800
Then she heard the sound of police cars.

53
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:07,830
The man in the car lifted up his gun.

54
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,900
Cristina felt afraid.

55
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,680
She wanted to go quickly.

56
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:17,620
She tried to start her bike but she couldn't.

57
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:22,280
Everybody else was moving but she couldn't.

58
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:25,430
Suddenly a taxi hit the back of her bike.

59
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:31,910
She fell from the bike onto the front of the
taxi and then down onto the road.

60
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:35,060
Her head hit the road hard.

61
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:41,600
She saw nothing, she felt nothing - she didn't
even hear the sound of the ambulance which

62
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,150
took her to hospital.

63
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:51,620
Two hours later Cristina was lying in bed
in hospital and her parents were waiting outside

64
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:53,960
her room with a policeman.

65
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,560
'Where's her helmet?'

66
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,000
asked Mr Rinaldi, Cristina's father.

67
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,850
'I know she had a helmet.

68
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:05,520
She always wore a helmet.'

69
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:10,780
'She didn't come in here with a helmet,' the
policeman told him.

70
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:18,990
'I can't believe it, she always wore her helmet,'
Mr Rinaldi said.

71
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:25,840
'Maybe the helmet fell on the road, maybe
the police left it there,' Mrs Rinaldi said

72
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,100
quietly to her husband.

73
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,729
'It's OK.

74
00:05:30,729 --> 00:05:35,330
I'm sure she's going to be all right.'

75
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:39,830
They waited ten more minutes before the doctor
came to see them.

76
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:44,330
'She's lucky,' the doctor said.

77
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:46,670
'She's going to be OK.

78
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:53,530
You can see her now, but she doesn't remember
anything about the accident.'

79
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:58,930
The doctor took them into the room where Cristina
lay in bed.

80
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:02,169
Cristina's mother and father began to cry.

81
00:06:02,169 --> 00:06:06,020
'Are you sure she's OK?'

82
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:08,000
they asked.

83
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,130
'Can't we take her home now?'

84
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:17,479
'No, it's better if she stays here for a few
days,' said the doctor.

85
00:06:17,479 --> 00:06:19,870
Her mother stood by her bed.

86
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:24,880
'Come back and live with us, Cristina,' she
said.

87
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,979
'It's not safe for you in the city.

88
00:06:27,979 --> 00:06:30,120
It's not only the traffic.

89
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,789
We hear so many terrible things.

90
00:06:32,789 --> 00:06:37,090
Please, Cristina, your room is there for you.

91
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:41,130
Come back and we'll look after you at home.

92
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:45,490
You can change your job if it's too far to
go.'

93
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:47,620
Cristina felt angry.

94
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:52,740
She had her own flat in the city center and
her own life.

95
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:55,550
She liked to look after herself.

96
00:06:55,550 --> 00:07:02,080
But her parents weren't happy about her staying
in the flat on her own after the accident.

97
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,370
Cristina couldn't believe her bad luck.

98
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:09,610
She lay in bed listening to her parents.

99
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:12,389
Her father tried some other ideas.

100
00:07:12,389 --> 00:07:17,220
'How about a flat with your brother, Cristina?

101
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:20,270
He'd like it and he could look after you.

102
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:24,940
Or maybe your mother could stay with you for
some time.

103
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:28,729
Just until you are better.'

104
00:07:28,729 --> 00:07:34,210
But two days later she went back to her own
flat alone.

105
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:35,819
She phoned the museum.

106
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:37,360
'I'm OK.

107
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:43,310
I'll be back at work in a week,' she told
the director.

108
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:50,199
Her mother visited her every day and Cristina
talked to her father every night on the phone.

109
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:56,379
They agreed to let her keep her flat but there
was something they disagreed with her about.

110
00:07:56,379 --> 00:08:01,419
They did not want her to keep the motorbike.

111
00:08:01,419 --> 00:08:06,190
All of Cristina's family talked about Cristina's
bad luck.

112
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:12,120
'It's the traffic in the city center,' her
aunt said when she phoned Cristina.

113
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:17,110
'It's the same at four in the afternoon and
three in the morning.'

114
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:24,150
'Those taxi drivers go too fast and they don't
look,' said her uncle who drove a bus through

115
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:27,330
the city center every day.

116
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:34,180
The story of the accident was in the newspaper,
a short story on the third page.

117
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:40,219
Cristina's name and job were there but there
was not a lot about the accident.

118
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:44,930
Cristina's brother cut the story of her accident
out of the newspaper and put it on the fridge

119
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:47,220
in his flat.

120
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:52,510
It wasn't every day that his sister was in
the newspaper!

121
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:55,430
But Cristina herself was worried.

122
00:08:55,430 --> 00:09:01,360
She couldn't remember anything about the accident
except the sun on her back when she was riding

123
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,959
down Avenida del Libertador.

124
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:07,930
But she wanted to remember.

125
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:10,970
The police were still asking questions.

126
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:15,550
The taxi driver said Cristina was sitting
there on her motorbike in the center of the

127
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:20,420
road when the traffic lights were green.

128
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:27,370
The doctor said she was all right but Cristina
felt strange - she got headaches - and she

129
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:37,640
tried hard to remember what happened, to find
answers, but she couldn't remember anything.

130
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:43,490
CHAPTER TWO
A plan to kill

131
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:50,980
In another area of the city, Roberto Bocuzzi
and his brother, Carlos, were afraid.

132
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:58,550
They were afraid that the woman on the motorbike
who saw their faces would tell the police.

133
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:06,560
Roberto and Carlos had $50,000 from a bank
robbery and now they were rich.

134
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:11,810
But they couldn't enjoy the money because
the police were looking for them and this

135
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:15,010
woman knew their faces.

136
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:18,240
They didn't want her to tell the police.

137
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,110
So they waited and made plans.

138
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:27,930
They made plans to kill the woman on the motorbike.

139
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:32,830
A week after the accident Cristina went back
to work.

140
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:40,050
She felt better and she really wanted to go
back to her new job as soon as possible.

141
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:45,660
She only got a headache now at the end of
the day when she was tired.

142
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:51,640
Her mother stopped visiting her in the flat
but she bought a lot of food.

143
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:58,450
She put it in the fridge so that Cristina
didn't have to go shopping for a few days.

144
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:00,910
Cristina went back to her old life.

145
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:06,810
She wanted to go back to the gym too but it
was too early.

146
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:11,480
'Be careful for a week or two,' the doctor
said.

147
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,180
'Don't do too much.

148
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:16,089
Remember, you were lucky.

149
00:11:16,089 --> 00:11:20,209
You can't remember the accident, but it was
a bad one.

150
00:11:20,209 --> 00:11:26,110
You lost your memory and you were lucky not
to lose your life.'

151
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:31,270
For two weeks Cristina worked on the Impressionist
exhibition.

152
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:37,100
She read a lot about the Paris museum and
made plans for the director of the museum,

153
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:41,760
Philippe Maudet, to visit Buenos Aires.

154
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:47,880
She took the bus to the museum in the morning
now, or walked when she had time.

155
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:51,750
She worked all day and then went home.

156
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:56,350
She went to bed early and tried to rest a
lot.

157
00:11:56,350 --> 00:12:02,250
A few weeks after the accident Cristina went
back to the Recoleta Health Club.

158
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:08,120
She looked through the window into the office
and smiled at the two people in there, Florencia

159
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:11,480
and Daniel.

160
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:17,940
Florencia was the receptionist and Daniel
was the gym manager of the health club.

161
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:23,200
Daniel was new there but he already looked
at home in the gym.

162
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:28,889
He spent most of his time in the office but
he exercised a lot when the gym was closed

163
00:12:28,889 --> 00:12:31,570
to other people.

164
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:35,230
He had blonde hair and blue eyes.

165
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:43,740
Visitors to Argentina often talked about how
many blonde, blue-eyed Argentines there were.

166
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:48,740
Cristina changed into her sports clothes and
went into the gym.

167
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:54,570
She only did a few exercises and then she
went to have a shower.

168
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:56,389
Daniel met her near the door.

169
00:12:56,389 --> 00:12:59,829
'You're back,' he said.

170
00:12:59,829 --> 00:13:03,269
'Were you on holiday?'

171
00:13:03,269 --> 00:13:05,410
Cristina didn't know what to say.

172
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:08,779
She didn't think anybody knew she had been
away.

173
00:13:08,779 --> 00:13:13,649
'I had a motorbike accident,' she answered
at last.

174
00:13:13,649 --> 00:13:18,330
'I was in hospital for a short time.'

175
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:19,520
Daniel looked at her.

176
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:24,269
'Are you OK now?' he asked.

177
00:13:24,269 --> 00:13:29,720
'I'm much better, but I only did a few exercises
in the gym today.

178
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:35,340
I still have to go slowly,' answered Cristina.

179
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:38,920
Daniel smiled and Cristina felt better.

180
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:45,370
'Be careful then,' he said and then he walked
back to his office.

181
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:49,190
Cristina took a shower and thought about Daniel.

182
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:54,090
She didn't know many people in the city center
- most of her friends lived near her parents'

183
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:59,720
house - and she hoped Daniel would become
a friend.

184
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:05,209
Cristina was tired that evening, but for the
first time she didn't have a headache.

185
00:14:05,209 --> 00:14:11,790
She could finally forget about the accident
and start living again.

186
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:17,820
On the other side of the city, Roberto Bocuzzi
also felt better.

187
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:22,639
He and his brother, Carlos, bought all the
newspapers from the day of the robbery and

188
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:27,209
the motorbike accident and looked at them
carefully.

189
00:14:27,209 --> 00:14:33,339
They read a lot of stories about the bank
robbery and then, finally, they found a story

190
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:36,010
about the motorbike accident.

191
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:41,250
It said that the woman worked in the Museo
Nacional de Bellas Artes...

192
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:47,300
They now knew who the woman who saw them was.

193
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:53,980
Every morning for almost a week Roberto stood
outside the museum and waited.

194
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:55,740
But he didn't see her.

195
00:14:55,740 --> 00:15:03,050
Then, a week after the accident he saw a woman
walking towards the museum.

196
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:08,780
When she got nearer he saw that it was the
woman he was waiting for.

197
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:11,380
He remembered her long hair.

198
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:14,130
He remembered her face.

199
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:20,120
Roberto didn't want her to see him, but there
were a lot of people in the street so it was

200
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,579
not difficult to hide.

201
00:15:23,579 --> 00:15:27,850
She walked quickly past him and she didn't
look at him.

202
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:30,899
She walked through the door of the museum.

203
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:33,330
Roberto looked at his watch.

204
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:37,839
It was just before half past eight.

205
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:44,180
Roberto went to the bar behind the museum,
the Cafe de Las Artes.

206
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:48,560
He bought a cup of coffee and phoned his brother.

207
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:53,290
Then he left the area quickly and took the
bus home.

208
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:57,579
At three o'clock that afternoon Roberto left
his flat again.

209
00:15:57,579 --> 00:16:04,779
At the bus stop near his home he waited for
one of the colorful old city buses.

210
00:16:04,779 --> 00:16:10,709
The ride across the city center was slow and
uncomfortable but at four o'clock he was outside

211
00:16:10,709 --> 00:16:12,870
the museum.

212
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:17,199
He saw Cristina leave the building at four
thirty.

213
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:21,649
He followed her along Avenida del Libertador.

214
00:16:21,649 --> 00:16:26,490
She walked so fast that he almost had to run.

215
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:33,779
After about fifteen minutes Roberto watched
Cristina walk in through some glass doors.

216
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:41,920
Above the doors he saw the name "Recoleta
Health Club" in red letters.

217
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,610
Roberto found a bar with tables outside.

218
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:49,600
From his table he could see the door of the
health club.

219
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:55,899
He waited until he saw Cristina leave the
gym and followed her home.

220
00:16:55,899 --> 00:16:58,709
He followed her for a few more days.

221
00:16:58,709 --> 00:17:03,430
He wanted to know if she did the same thing
every day.

222
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:12,440
He also wanted to visit the gym before he
decided how to kill her.

223
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:18,900
CHAPTER THREE
All the way from Paris

224
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:22,390
Cristina's days were nearly always the same.

225
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:28,150
She began work at the museum at eight thirty
and left at four thirty.

226
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:34,380
Then she went to the gym after work and stayed
there for about an hour and a half.

227
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:36,770
Then she went back home.

228
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:40,919
She sometimes stopped at the supermarket on
her way.

229
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:48,260
Roberto and Carlos watched her for six days
until their plan to kill her was ready.

230
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:55,500
Cristina, on the other hand, did not feel
that her life was the same as before.

231
00:17:55,500 --> 00:18:01,419
The museum and her hours were the same but
her work was very different.

232
00:18:01,419 --> 00:18:08,070
The new exhibition was keeping her very busy
and she was very happy.

233
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:11,900
Cristina was sitting in her office when the
phone rang.

234
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:17,830
'Hello, Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes, Cristina
Rinaldi speaking.'

235
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:23,640
'Oh Cristina, hello.'

236
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,740
Cristina knew the French voice.

237
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,720
'Hello Philippe.

238
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,690
How is everything?'

239
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:32,400
'Fine thank you.

240
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,900
How are you?' asked Philippe.

241
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:35,900
'Great.

242
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:39,100
When are you arriving?'

243
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:41,600
'On Wednesday.

244
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:47,570
My plane arrives in Buenos Aires at nine fifteen
in the morning.

245
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:50,570
I'm travelling with Air France.

246
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:54,700
The flight number is AF602.

247
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,919
Will anyone be there to meet me?'

248
00:18:56,919 --> 00:18:58,830
'Oh yes.

249
00:18:58,830 --> 00:18:59,830
I'll be there.

250
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:03,420
I'll meet you and take you to your hotel.

251
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:07,630
Then, when you're ready, you can come to the
museum.'

252
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:09,530
'That's fine.

253
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:11,580
Thank you, Cristina.

254
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:17,520
I'm flying back to Paris on Monday so I'll
have time to look around Buenos Aires a little

255
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:23,570
- everyone tells me it's a beautiful city
- so I'm going to be a tourist as well as

256
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:25,400
a museum director!'

257
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,950
'Good idea.

258
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:29,420
There's so much to see.

259
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:34,040
I think you'll like it,' answered Cristina.

260
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:37,580
She liked the sound of this man's voice.

261
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:38,840
'I'm looking forward to meeting you.'

262
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,100
'Me too.

263
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:44,200
I'll see you at the airport on Wednesday.'

264
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,570
'Have a good flight.'

265
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:49,309
'Thank you.

266
00:19:49,309 --> 00:19:52,059
Good bye.'

267
00:19:52,059 --> 00:19:56,870
Cristina put the phone down and looked at
the picture of the Claude Monet painting she

268
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:59,720
had on the wall in her office.

269
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:05,270
When she was fifteen years old she went to
France with her parents and fell in love with

270
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:10,020
that painting with its field of red poppies.

271
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:15,130
She went to see every Impressionist painting
she could find in Paris.

272
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:20,390
She spent hours in the museums and didn't
want to leave Paris.

273
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:26,980
Her parents understood then that she was serious
about studying art at university.

274
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:32,520
She kept the picture on the wall in her office
because it made her feel good.

275
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:36,000
She had the same picture on her bedroom wall.

276
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,520
She often looked at it when she was thinking.

277
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:43,909
But today she looked away from it quickly.

278
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:47,790
There was something strange about the picture
today.

279
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:50,520
It didn't make her feel happy.

280
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:54,130
It gave her a strange feeling inside.

281
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:56,340
She didn't know why.

282
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:59,880
Maybe it was because she was thinking so much
about the new exhibition.

283
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:06,120
An exhibition of thirty-seven paintings was
a lot of work.

284
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:10,210
She had a lot to do before Philippe arrived
on Wednesday.

285
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:13,370
She took her notebook and left her office.

286
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:18,460
She had to talk to somebody about the lights
for the exhibition.

287
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:23,670
That afternoon she left the museum a little
later than usual.

288
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:30,760
Carlos Bocuzzi was still outside but he was
getting tired of waiting.

289
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:33,400
'Maybe she went home early.

290
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,630
Maybe she's ill.

291
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:40,750
Maybe she's working late,' he thought to himself.

292
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:47,050
Just then Cristina came out of the museum
and Carlos followed her.

293
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:53,020
Cristina walked into Plaza Francia as usual
but then stopped for a moment.

294
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:59,120
She looked up at the white stone bodies of
the monument in the center of the Plaza.

295
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:06,740
The French people who lived in Buenos Aires
gave this monument to the city in 1910.

296
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:13,830
This was the monument she could see from her
office window in the museum across the street.

297
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:19,290
Now she was thinking about France and the
French paintings that would soon be in the

298
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:21,900
museum behind her.

299
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:25,299
Carlos stood in the Plaza Francia.

300
00:22:25,299 --> 00:22:30,940
Most of the other people there were students
from the university building behind the museum.

301
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:33,970
They stood around in groups.

302
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:37,810
They were waiting for friends and talking.

303
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:43,340
In the park behind Carlos, the dog walkers
of Buenos Aires were taking their dogs for

304
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:45,300
their afternoon walk.

305
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:51,960
Each girl or boy had seven or eight dogs that
needed a walk morning and afternoon.

306
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:56,330
It was often a job for young people who wanted
to earn some money.

307
00:22:56,330 --> 00:23:00,980
They stopped at the flats in their area to
get the dogs and then took them out to the

308
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:04,440
city parks.

309
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:08,160
Carlos was watching Cristina and thinking.

310
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:13,200
He was beginning to feel that he knew this
girl and it was more difficult than before

311
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,020
to think of killing her.

312
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:19,460
But he knew that Roberto had a good plan.

313
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:25,400
'I mustn't be afraid,' Carlos thought to himself.

314
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,440
'Roberto is careful.

315
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:29,970
He has thought of everything.

316
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:35,679
Roberto has been to the gym three times, each
time with different color hair and different

317
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:37,510
clothes.

318
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:43,750
Now Roberto knew about day tickets to the
gym and knew which machines and weights Cristina

319
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:45,370
used.

320
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:50,440
This evening Carlos didn't need to stay outside
the gym and wait for Cristina.

321
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:54,510
This evening Carlos could go home.

322
00:23:54,510 --> 00:24:02,429
It was the last time he had to follow Cristina
- Roberto was going to kill her the next day.

323
00:24:02,429 --> 00:24:06,270
'I must not be afraid.

324
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:12,950
Only a few hours more,' he said to himself
over and over again.

325
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:19,679
Carlos was afraid but he felt sure that his
brother would kill Cristina.

326
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,549
Roberto was strong.

327
00:24:21,549 --> 00:24:31,080
'That woman has to die,' Roberto told him
every night.

328
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:37,100
CHAPTER FOUR
An accident in the gym

329
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:43,570
The next evening, after work, Cristina was
doing exercises in the gym.

330
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:50,280
Twenty-eight, twenty-nine, thirty...

331
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:54,340
her stomach began to hurt, but she did not
stop.

332
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:56,500
She was working hard.

333
00:24:56,500 --> 00:25:00,620
She wanted to feel as good as she did before
the accident.

334
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:06,370
She decided to stay longer that evening and
do a few more exercises.

335
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:11,210
She was finding it hard to stay in the flat
in the evenings this week.

336
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:16,600
She couldn't sit quietly and watch television
or listen to music.

337
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:22,669
In less than twenty-four hours she had to
be at Ezeiza Airport and she had to be ready

338
00:25:22,669 --> 00:25:27,700
for every question Philippe Maudet could ask.

339
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:30,080
She looked around the gym.

340
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:35,270
It was crowded and most of the machines were
busy.

341
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:41,510
There were more new health clubs in the city
of Buenos Aires than new restaurants.

342
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:46,560
Spring was especially busy as people were
beginning to think of the summer and going

343
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:49,600
to the beach.

344
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,320
Cristina went into the weights room.

345
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,660
It wasn't crowded in there.

346
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:59,740
You could always find a quiet place around
five o'clock.

347
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:03,890
Cristina chose her weight and lay on her back.

348
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:09,820
She didn't look behind her but she knew that
there was somebody else there.

349
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:16,630
She closed her eyes and thought about her
favorite painting, the one in her office.

350
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:20,049
This usually helped her to lift the weight.

351
00:26:20,049 --> 00:26:26,220
She thought about that field of red flowers,
but once again the picture in her head of

352
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:30,309
the painting gave her a strange feeling.

353
00:26:30,309 --> 00:26:34,130
The red flowers made her feel afraid.

354
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:37,380
She decided to think about home.

355
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:39,220
That was better.

356
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:44,320
After a few minutes she was ready to lift
the heavy weight above her head.

357
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:52,420
Daniel, the gym manager, sat in his office
looking out of the door towards the busy gym.

358
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:55,460
He was thinking about Cristina.

359
00:26:55,460 --> 00:27:02,030
She was the kind of person he liked and he
felt they could be friends.

360
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:07,870
Daniel had a girlfriend in his home city of
Rosario and he was finding life very quiet

361
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:09,980
without her.

362
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:15,840
He had a cousin in Buenos Aires and sometimes
they went out for a pizza together and then

363
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:20,370
went dancing on Friday or Saturday evenings.

364
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:26,690
But Daniel wanted to find some friends of
his own and start to build a life in the city

365
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:29,210
center.

366
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:33,190
Cristina was the first person he wanted to
make friends with.

367
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:36,370
He wanted to ask her to go out for a pizza
that weekend...

368
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:41,860
Suddenly, Daniel heard a shout.

369
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:46,110
He got up quickly and ran out of his office.

370
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:49,169
Somebody was hurt in the weights room.

371
00:27:49,169 --> 00:27:51,980
People were already there.

372
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:58,060
Daniel looked down and saw the long black
hair of the girl on the floor.

373
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:59,370
It was Cristina.

374
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:01,200
'Are you OK?'

375
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,090
Daniel asked.

376
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:06,580
'I'll call an ambulance.'

377
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:07,909
She wanted to get up.

378
00:28:07,909 --> 00:28:12,890
Her arm was hurt but she didn't want to stay
on the floor.

379
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:16,840
She got up slowly and moved away from the
people.

380
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:20,630
'I'm OK,' she said to Daniel.

381
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:23,500
'I don't need anything.

382
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:27,169
It's just my arm.'

383
00:28:27,169 --> 00:28:30,860
Daniel took her slowly to his office and gave
her a chair.

384
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:36,950
'Sit here and rest for a moment,' he said.

385
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:40,660
After a short time, Cristina looked a little
better.

386
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:43,289
'I feel much better.

387
00:28:43,289 --> 00:28:45,370
I don't need an ambulance.'

388
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:47,549
'Are you sure?'

389
00:28:47,549 --> 00:28:52,590
'I just want to go home,' Cristina said.

390
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:56,799
'OK, but could you tell me what happened?'

391
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:59,020
Daniel said.

392
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:02,370
'It's important that I know.'

393
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:06,400
'I'm not really sure,' Cristina said quietly.

394
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:11,230
'I think the weight fell but I moved just
in time.

395
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:14,549
It hit my arm.

396
00:29:14,549 --> 00:29:18,480
Maybe it was too heavy for me.'

397
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:22,080
'Accidents do happen sometimes,' Daniel said.

398
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:27,480
'The important thing is that you're all right.'

399
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:30,659
Daniel then went to look around the weights
room.

400
00:29:30,659 --> 00:29:34,740
He looked at the heavy weight on the floor.

401
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:39,020
'Cristina must be strong,' he thought.

402
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:41,480
He went back to his office.

403
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:46,280
He wasn't sure that Cristina was telling him
everything about the accident.

404
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:50,029
Her face was very white and she looked afraid.

405
00:29:50,029 --> 00:29:56,549
'Are you sure the weight fell?' he asked.

406
00:29:56,549 --> 00:30:01,470
'No, it didn't,' Cristina said quietly.

407
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:03,700
'Somebody pushed the weight.

408
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:07,340
I saw it and moved just in time.'

409
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:13,169
'Could it be true that somebody wanted to
hurt her?'

410
00:30:13,169 --> 00:30:14,799
Daniel thought.

411
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:19,200
He wanted to find out who was in the gym that
evening.

412
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:23,980
Everybody who came to the gym showed their
health club card to the receptionist and the

413
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:27,040
number went into the computer.

414
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:31,660
He could look at the computer and see who
came in that day.

415
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:36,419
He could also see how many day tickets were
bought that morning.

416
00:30:36,419 --> 00:30:39,659
But he couldn't know who bought the day tickets.

417
00:30:39,659 --> 00:30:45,049
First, he needed to help Cristina home.

418
00:30:45,049 --> 00:30:48,850
'Can I give you a ride home in my car?' he
asked.

419
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:53,960
'No, thank you, I prefer to walk.

420
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:58,270
The air will be good for me,' Cristina answered.

421
00:30:58,270 --> 00:31:00,130
Then she stood up.

422
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:03,230
She didn't feel well.

423
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:08,510
'Maybe that ride is a good idea,' she said.

424
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:13,340
Before Daniel left the office, he spoke quickly
to Florencia.

425
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:20,890
He asked Florencia to try and remember anything
she could about visitors to the gym that week.

426
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:23,640
'I'll be here early in the morning.

427
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:31,690
Maybe you can tell me then what you remember,'
he said to Florencia as he left the gym.

428
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:34,130
Cristina was a little afraid.

429
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:37,910
She wasn't sure about going in Daniel's car.

430
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:43,799
He looked kind and friendly but she didn't
even know his full name.

431
00:31:43,799 --> 00:31:49,320
She was going to say that she wanted to walk,
but then he said, 'Don't worry.

432
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:55,309
I just want to be sure that you get home safely.'

433
00:31:55,309 --> 00:31:56,669
Cristina got in.

434
00:31:56,669 --> 00:31:58,910
She wasn't afraid now.

435
00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:10,039
'I think I've found my first friend in the
city,' she thought as he drove her home.

436
00:32:10,039 --> 00:32:18,399
CHAPTER FIVE
Looking good, feeling bad

437
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:21,830
Cristina opened her eyes and looked at her
watch.

438
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:24,690
It was six thirty in the morning.

439
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:29,040
She tried to move but she felt bad.

440
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,809
She felt her arm.

441
00:32:30,809 --> 00:32:34,230
It was very difficult to move.

442
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:36,460
She closed her eyes again.

443
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:38,230
She couldn't believe it.

444
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:44,570
It was a very important day for her but she
couldn't get out of bed.

445
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:51,460
It was now nearly seven o'clock and she still
couldn't move her arm.

446
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:56,700
Any other day she could stay in bed, but not
today.

447
00:32:56,700 --> 00:33:02,779
Philippe Maudet was arriving in Buenos Aires
in less than three hours and she had to give

448
00:33:02,779 --> 00:33:06,460
a talk about the exhibition at the museum.

449
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:10,289
She had to get up.

450
00:33:10,289 --> 00:33:17,130
Her arm felt better after a shower but hurt
when she brushed her hair.

451
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:23,610
She went into the small kitchen in her flat
and made a large cup of coffee.

452
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:30,490
She didn't usually eat much breakfast but
this morning she felt that she needed some.

453
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:36,630
She found some bread in the cupboard and put
some dulce de leche on it.

454
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:40,049
The sweet taste was really good.

455
00:33:40,049 --> 00:33:42,730
She walked back into her bedroom.

456
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:48,049
She was trying not to think about the accident
but she couldn't stop.

457
00:33:48,049 --> 00:33:53,059
She looked at the clock and saw that it was
time to get dressed.

458
00:33:53,059 --> 00:33:57,720
She didn't feel good but she wanted to look
good.

459
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:00,840
She tried on a short black skirt.

460
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,399
It didn't feel comfortable.

461
00:34:03,399 --> 00:34:10,020
She usually wore that skirt to go out with
her parents and it didn't feel right today.

462
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:16,429
She tried on a brown suit and then a green
jacket and skirt, but she wasn't happy with

463
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:18,810
them either.

464
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:26,350
At a quarter to eight she decided on a pair
of black trousers and a white shirt.

465
00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:29,119
She went back into her small kitchen.

466
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:31,740
Her arm was hurting a lot again.

467
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:37,550
She took some medicine and then she wrote
down a number from the book near the phone.

468
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:40,960
It was her doctor's phone number.

469
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:47,139
'Maybe I'll call later about my arm,' she
said to herself.

470
00:34:47,139 --> 00:34:52,859
Then she left her flat and went to find a
taxi.

471
00:34:52,859 --> 00:34:59,130
On flight AF602 Philippe Maudet got up from
his seat and walked down the plane towards

472
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:01,560
the toilets.

473
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:04,010
He didn't feel good.

474
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:08,040
It was difficult to sleep on the long flight.

475
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:12,880
He cleaned his teeth, shaved, and washed.

476
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,300
That felt a little better.

477
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:20,160
He went back to his seat and sat down to eat
his breakfast.

478
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:24,250
Only about two hours to go.

479
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:28,100
The man next to Philippe wanted to talk.

480
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:35,240
Philippe smiled at him and answered questions
about who he was and where he worked.

481
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:41,859
The man was a Porteno: he was born in the
city of Buenos Aires.

482
00:35:41,859 --> 00:35:45,869
He wanted to tell Philippe everything about
Buenos Aires.

483
00:35:45,869 --> 00:35:53,830
They looked at a map of Buenos Aires while
the man talked about his city and its buildings.

484
00:35:53,830 --> 00:36:00,260
He told Philippe about the different parts
of the city that he must visit: La Boca with

485
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:07,980
its colorful little street called Caminito,
full of color and life - the small metal houses

486
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:14,780
there are blue, green, red and yellow and
the painters work and show their paintings

487
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:17,270
in the street.

488
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:24,829
He talked about San Telmo and its old buildings
- in the restaurants and theatres of San Telmo

489
00:36:24,829 --> 00:36:30,390
you can see tango dancers and hear the real
music of Buenos Aires.

490
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:37,349
He talked about the Plaza de Mayo and the
pink building, La Casa Rosada, where the President

491
00:36:37,349 --> 00:36:39,859
of the country works.

492
00:36:39,859 --> 00:36:43,751
He talked about the shops and the nightlife.

493
00:36:43,751 --> 00:36:51,400
'The city never sleeps: you can eat, drink
and dance until the morning.'

494
00:36:51,400 --> 00:37:00,320
They were arriving in Buenos Aires on 21 September,
the first day of spring and Students' Day.

495
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:07,079
On this day the students in Argentina begin
their last part of the school year.

496
00:37:07,079 --> 00:37:12,840
Across the country the city centers are full
of young people enjoying themselves.

497
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:18,220
They walk around the parks and go to bars
and restaurants.

498
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:19,290
Philippe was interested.

499
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:23,599
He was looking forward to seeing Buenos Aires.

500
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:28,390
People called it the "Paris of South America"
and he was sure that he was going to like

501
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:32,180
it.

502
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:38,100
Roberto and Carlos Bocuzzi were still asleep
at seven o'clock that morning.

503
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:42,730
Roberto opened his eyes and remembered where
he was.

504
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:47,130
He remembered that Cristina Rinaldi was still
alive.

505
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:49,930
He closed his eyes again.

506
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:56,350
He wanted to believe that he and Carlos were
free, free to spend their money and live a

507
00:37:56,350 --> 00:37:59,960
good life without being afraid.

508
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:03,930
He wanted to believe that Cristina was dead.

509
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:09,470
But he remembered every moment of the evening
before in the gym.

510
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:13,650
He was using one of the weights in the weights
room.

511
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:19,210
Cristina was there in front of him, ready
to lift a heavy weight.

512
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:23,520
She was wearing grey shorts and a white T-shirt.

513
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:26,260
She was slim and pretty.

514
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:30,320
He could see her long dark hair around her
head.

515
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:33,270
Her eyes were closed.

516
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:38,160
When she started to lift the weight, he moved
nearer to her.

517
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:43,540
When the weight was right above her head,
he ran forward and pushed the weight down

518
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:45,540
hard.

519
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:47,940
She opened her eyes and looked at him.

520
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:53,339
She saw the weight falling and moved just
in time.

521
00:38:53,339 --> 00:38:55,790
The weight hit the floor.

522
00:38:55,790 --> 00:39:00,829
Then she shouted and people from the other
room ran to her.

523
00:39:00,829 --> 00:39:04,560
Roberto left quickly and quietly.

524
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,970
He remembered it all.

525
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:10,910
He knew that she was still alive.

526
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:15,530
He got out of bed and walked into his brother's
room.

527
00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:18,270
He wanted to talk.

528
00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:23,770
They needed a new plan.

529
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:30,369
CHAPTER SIX
Meeting someone special

530
00:39:30,369 --> 00:39:33,650
Cristina got into a taxi at eight o'clock.

531
00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:38,600
It was only about thirty-five kilometers to
the airport, but she knew there would be a

532
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:41,190
lot of traffic.

533
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:46,820
She sat in the back of the taxi and she thought
about Philippe Maudet.

534
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:49,020
What did he look like?

535
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:54,869
She knew his voice well but she didn't know
much else about him.

536
00:39:54,869 --> 00:40:01,420
In her bag she had a large piece of paper
with "P. Maudet" written on it.

537
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:06,020
She thought she would need it if the airport
was very crowded.

538
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:11,850
She arrived at the airport early but she saw
that the plane was also early.

539
00:40:11,850 --> 00:40:15,140
Philippe could be there at any moment.

540
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:20,170
She found a good place to stand and she held
the paper up in her hand.

541
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:23,400
She watched and waited.

542
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:28,940
After a few minutes, a man stopped in front
of her and said, 'Cristina, thank you for

543
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:30,460
coming.

544
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:34,099
I'm very happy to meet you.'

545
00:40:34,099 --> 00:40:40,460
The first thing she saw were two very dark
brown eyes smiling at her.

546
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:44,849
Cristina smiled at the young Frenchman standing
in front of her.

547
00:40:44,849 --> 00:40:47,290
She shook the man's hand.

548
00:40:47,290 --> 00:40:50,640
'How was your flight, Philippe?

549
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,570
I'm sure you must be tired.

550
00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:58,829
We'll go to the hotel and you can rest before
we go to the museum,' she said.

551
00:40:58,829 --> 00:41:04,160
'No, no, that's not necessary,' replied Philippe.

552
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:07,270
'I'm fine and I want to see the museum.

553
00:41:07,270 --> 00:41:09,430
Let's go straight there.

554
00:41:09,430 --> 00:41:15,500
I'd just like a cup of coffee and then I'll
be ready for work.'

555
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:18,960
There was a good coffee shop near the museum.

556
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:25,060
They could get out of the taxi in Plaza Francia,
thought Cristina, drink some coffee and then

557
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:28,250
go into the museum.

558
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:30,340
Cristina liked Philippe.

559
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:34,950
He seemed the kind of person she could enjoy
spending time with.

560
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:39,680
She had the feeling the day was going to be
all right.

561
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:43,470
The taxi driver was waiting outside the airport
building.

562
00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:50,230
The driver smiled at Cristina and put Philippe's
small suitcase in the back of the taxi.

563
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:52,990
Cristina and Philippe got in.

564
00:41:52,990 --> 00:42:00,350
The sun was just getting warm as the taxi
turned into the Avenida del Libertador.

565
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:04,020
Cristina could see Plaza Francia in front
of them.

566
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:07,250
She asked the taxi driver to stop.

567
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:12,520
She then paid him while Philippe took his
bag out of the taxi and found a table outside

568
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,690
in the sun.

569
00:42:14,690 --> 00:42:18,630
He sat down and put on his sunglasses.

570
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:21,880
He looked at all the young people around.

571
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:28,349
He could see they were students and remembered
that it was Students' Day.

572
00:42:28,349 --> 00:42:34,010
Cristina turned around and looked at the good-looking
man waiting for her at the table.

573
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:38,470
She sat down and the waiter came to take their
order.

574
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:43,940
At a quarter past ten they were sitting with
coffee and churros.

575
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:49,369
They talked for some time about their lives
and their work and their love of Impressionist

576
00:42:49,369 --> 00:42:52,099
paintings.

577
00:42:52,099 --> 00:42:58,119
Cristina and Philippe spent the day in meetings
with the museum director, Leonardo Martinez,

578
00:42:58,119 --> 00:43:01,540
and other people who worked at the museum.

579
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:07,020
It didn't open to the public until half past
twelve so they could have meetings and look

580
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:10,920
around the museum easily.

581
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:17,500
Just before she had to give her talk Cristina
ran to the toilets and took some medicine.

582
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:23,120
Her arm was beginning to hurt badly, but she
soon forgot about it as she talked about the

583
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:25,650
exhibition.

584
00:43:25,650 --> 00:43:31,130
She felt that Philippe was happy, but she
couldn't talk to him very much at lunch.

585
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:38,980
They walked to a restaurant Campos del Pilar,
near the museum, with everybody from the meeting.

586
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:44,390
They chose Argentine beef and watched while
it cooked on the fire in the center of the

587
00:43:44,390 --> 00:43:46,510
restaurant.

588
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:50,690
Cristina was at the opposite end of the table
to Philippe.

589
00:43:50,690 --> 00:43:54,589
She watched him talking and laughing with
everybody.

590
00:43:54,589 --> 00:43:57,690
She could see that everybody liked him.

591
00:43:57,690 --> 00:44:00,810
She liked him too.

592
00:44:00,810 --> 00:44:06,940
After the afternoon meeting, Philippe and
Cristina were ready to leave the museum.

593
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:11,790
Cristina was really very tired but she wanted
to look after Philippe during his stay in

594
00:44:11,790 --> 00:44:13,670
Buenos Aires.

595
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:16,319
'How about dinner?'

596
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:18,130
she asked.

597
00:44:18,130 --> 00:44:20,069
Philippe smiled.

598
00:44:20,069 --> 00:44:26,609
'I'm really sorry, but I'll have dinner in
the hotel tonight, if it's OK.

599
00:44:26,609 --> 00:44:28,680
I'm so tired.

600
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:31,859
I think I'll try and get some sleep.

601
00:44:31,859 --> 00:44:33,990
Can we go out tomorrow evening?'

602
00:44:33,990 --> 00:44:37,450
'Of course,' Cristina said.

603
00:44:37,450 --> 00:44:39,230
'I'll take you to the hotel now.

604
00:44:39,230 --> 00:44:41,150
We have a busy day tomorrow.'

605
00:44:41,150 --> 00:44:45,490
'Thanks,' Philippe replied.

606
00:44:45,490 --> 00:44:49,680
'Maybe after tomorrow's meeting, you can show
me around your city a little.

607
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:54,220
I'm looking forward to seeing it.'

608
00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:56,930
Cristina took Philippe to his hotel in a taxi.

609
00:44:56,930 --> 00:44:58,840
'See you tomorrow.

610
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:03,140
I hope you sleep well,' she said.

611
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:07,710
She watched him walk through the front doors
of the Sheraton Hotel.

612
00:45:07,710 --> 00:45:08,710
She wanted to stay and talk to Philippe Maudet.

613
00:45:08,710 --> 00:45:09,710
She wanted to have dinner with him and find
out more about him.

614
00:45:09,710 --> 00:45:10,710
She thought he was wonderful.

615
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:11,710
When Cristina got home she couldn't stop thinking
about Philippe.

616
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:12,710
She smiled to herself.

617
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:13,710
She listened to her phone messages.

618
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:14,710
There were two from Daniel.

619
00:45:14,710 --> 00:45:15,710
He wanted to know how she was feeling and
he wanted to talk to her about the accident.

620
00:45:15,710 --> 00:45:16,710
'Daniel is a nice man,' she thought.

621
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:17,710
And she felt happy.

622
00:45:17,710 --> 00:45:18,710
She tried to forget about her arm but it was
hurting badly again.

623
00:45:18,710 --> 00:45:19,710
She took some more medicine and sat on her
bed.

624
00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:20,710
She looked up at the picture of red poppies
in Monet's painting on the wall of her bedroom.

625
00:45:20,710 --> 00:45:21,710
The picture made her feel strange again.

626
00:45:21,710 --> 00:45:22,710
There was something wrong, but she didn't
know what it was.

627
00:45:22,710 --> 00:45:23,710
She lay in bed for a long time before she
fell asleep.

628
00:45:23,710 --> 00:45:24,710
There were two other people who couldn't sleep
that night: Roberto and Carlos.

629
00:45:24,710 --> 00:45:25,710
They were talking.

630
00:45:25,710 --> 00:45:26,710
Roberto was angry with himself, but Carlos
understood.

631
00:45:26,710 --> 00:45:27,710
'I couldn't kill her myself,' he said.

632
00:45:27,710 --> 00:45:28,710
'It's easy to talk about killing, it's a different
thing to do it.

633
00:45:28,710 --> 00:45:29,710
We must make a new plan.

634
00:45:29,710 --> 00:45:30,710
A plan that's not so difficult.

635
00:45:30,710 --> 00:45:31,710
A plan where we don't have to go too near
her ourselves.'

636
00:45:31,710 --> 00:45:32,710
'But I almost did it,' Roberto said.

637
00:45:32,710 --> 00:45:33,710
He couldn't understand why he hadn't pushed
the weight down harder.

638
00:45:33,710 --> 00:45:34,710
He had stopped for one second.

639
00:45:34,710 --> 00:45:35,710
In that second, Cristina had moved away from
the falling weight.

640
00:45:35,710 --> 00:45:36,710
CHAPTER SEVEN
A bad night in town

641
00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:37,710
At seven o'clock the next morning the phone
rang in Cristina's flat.

642
00:45:37,710 --> 00:45:38,710
It rang many times before Cristina answered.

643
00:45:38,710 --> 00:45:39,710
She took a long time to wake up.

644
00:45:39,710 --> 00:45:40,710
'Hello.

645
00:45:40,710 --> 00:45:41,710
Who is it?'

646
00:45:41,710 --> 00:45:42,710
she asked at last.

647
00:45:42,710 --> 00:45:43,710
'Cristina.

648
00:45:43,710 --> 00:45:44,710
It's me, Daniel.

649
00:45:44,710 --> 00:45:45,710
Are you OK?

650
00:45:45,710 --> 00:45:46,710
You didn't phone me back yesterday.

651
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:47,710
Is everything all right?'

652
00:45:47,710 --> 00:45:48,710
'Well, I'm fine, but I don't like this feeling
that somebody is trying to hurt me.'

653
00:45:48,710 --> 00:45:49,710
'That's why I'm phoning you.

654
00:45:49,710 --> 00:45:50,710
Do you want to go to the police with your
story?'

655
00:45:50,710 --> 00:45:51,710
'I don't think so.

656
00:45:51,710 --> 00:45:52,710
I know I saw the man in the gym who pushed
the weight.

657
00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:53,710
But I don't think I could tell the police
what he looks like.

658
00:45:53,710 --> 00:45:54,710
I don't know him.'

659
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:55,710
'OK,' Daniel said.

660
00:45:55,710 --> 00:45:56,710
'But I'm worried about you, Cristina.

661
00:45:56,710 --> 00:45:57,710
Would you like to come to the club tonight
and talk about it?'

662
00:45:57,710 --> 00:45:58,710
'I'm sorry.

663
00:45:58,710 --> 00:45:59,710
I have to go out.

664
00:45:59,710 --> 00:46:00,710
But I can probably come to see you quickly
after work,' Cristina said.

665
00:46:00,710 --> 00:46:01,710
'OK.

666
00:46:01,710 --> 00:46:02,710
See you later, then,' Daniel answered.

667
00:46:02,710 --> 00:46:03,710
'Thanks for thinking of me.'

668
00:46:03,710 --> 00:46:04,710
Cristina meant it.

669
00:46:04,710 --> 00:46:05,710
Daniel was very kind to her.

670
00:46:05,710 --> 00:46:06,710
Cristina got ready and walked to the museum.

671
00:46:06,710 --> 00:46:07,710
She arrived a few minutes before eight thirty
but it was not quiet.

672
00:46:07,710 --> 00:46:08,710
The museum was full of life.

673
00:46:08,710 --> 00:46:09,710
Cristina sat in her office for a moment.

674
00:46:09,710 --> 00:46:10,710
Three people looked in through the door at
her.

675
00:46:10,710 --> 00:46:11,710
'Hi, Cristina.

676
00:46:11,710 --> 00:46:12,710
Great talk yesterday.'

677
00:46:12,710 --> 00:46:13,710
'Everything's going really well, Cristina.'

678
00:46:13,710 --> 00:46:14,710
'Hi, Cris.

679
00:46:14,710 --> 00:46:15,710
Good luck today.'

680
00:46:15,710 --> 00:46:16,710
There were smiling faces and kind words everywhere.

681
00:46:16,710 --> 00:46:17,710
She heard Philippe Maudet's voice outside
her office and went out to meet him.

682
00:46:17,710 --> 00:46:18,710
Cristina and Philippe spent another day in
meetings.

683
00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:19,710
After lunch, Philippe showed the museum directors
photographs of the paintings he wanted to

684
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:20,710
bring to Buenos Aires.

685
00:46:20,710 --> 00:46:21,710
He had a photograph of the painting with the
red poppies, the same painting that Cristina

686
00:46:21,710 --> 00:46:22,710
had in her office and her bedroom.

687
00:46:22,710 --> 00:46:23,710
Cristina took the photograph in her hand.

688
00:46:23,710 --> 00:46:24,710
Suddenly she felt cold and sick.

689
00:46:24,710 --> 00:46:25,710
She didn't know why.

690
00:46:25,710 --> 00:46:26,710
This was her favorite painting.

691
00:46:26,710 --> 00:46:27,710
It was strange that it was making her feel
like this.

692
00:46:27,710 --> 00:46:28,710
She passed it quickly to the person on her
left.

693
00:46:28,710 --> 00:46:29,710
At half past five Philippe turned to Cristina
and said, 'How about our walk around the city?

694
00:46:29,710 --> 00:46:30,710
Is it still OK?'

695
00:46:30,710 --> 00:46:31,710
'Yes, of course.

696
00:46:31,710 --> 00:46:32,710
Do you need to go back to your hotel?

697
00:46:32,710 --> 00:46:33,710
I could meet you there if you want,' said
Cristina.

698
00:46:33,710 --> 00:46:34,710
'No, there's no need.

699
00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:35,710
Let's go now,' answered Philippe.

700
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:36,710
He took his jacket and followed Cristina out
of her office.

701
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:37,710
The two of them left the museum and walked
down Avenida del Libertador.

702
00:46:37,710 --> 00:46:38,710
Cristina showed Philippe the Recoleta Cemetery.

703
00:46:38,710 --> 00:46:39,710
She told him the story of General San Martin
who was the "Libertador", the man who made

704
00:46:39,710 --> 00:46:40,710
Argentina free.

705
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:41,710
And there above the buildings and the trees
you can see the top of the English Tower,'

706
00:46:41,710 --> 00:46:42,710
Cristina said.

707
00:46:42,710 --> 00:46:43,710
'It's the same as Big Ben in London.

708
00:46:43,710 --> 00:46:44,710
The British people who lived in Buenos Aires
gave the tower to the city in 1910.'

709
00:46:44,710 --> 00:46:45,710
Philippe smiled.

710
00:46:45,710 --> 00:46:46,710
'You'll want a tower like the Eiffel Tower
from me before I leave,' Philippe said.

711
00:46:46,710 --> 00:46:47,710
'No I'll be happy with thirty-seven Impressionist
paintings.'

712
00:46:47,710 --> 00:46:48,710
Cristina smiled and they walked on down the
Avenida.

713
00:46:48,710 --> 00:46:49,710
As they walked, Cristina decided to stop at
the gym so that she could talk to Daniel quickly.

714
00:46:49,710 --> 00:46:50,710
Then they could get a taxi and drive around
the center a little.

715
00:46:50,710 --> 00:46:51,710
They could drive to Plaza de Mayo and see
the famous buildings there, then come back

716
00:46:51,710 --> 00:46:52,710
to have a drink in a bar in the Plaza San
Martin.

717
00:46:52,710 --> 00:46:53,710
After that they could walk on to the new area
of Puerto Madero.

718
00:46:53,710 --> 00:46:54,710
She wanted to take Philippe to the restaurant
where her father took her on the day she got

719
00:46:54,710 --> 00:46:55,710
the job at the museum.

720
00:46:55,710 --> 00:46:56,710
Then after dinner they could go to San Telmo
and see a tango show at El Viejo Almacen.

721
00:46:56,710 --> 00:46:57,710
She couldn't let Philippe leave without hearing
the real music of Argentina.

722
00:46:57,710 --> 00:46:58,710
Soon they were outside the Recoleta Health
Club.

723
00:46:58,710 --> 00:46:59,710
'This is the gym I go to,' Cristina explained
to Philippe.

724
00:46:59,710 --> 00:47:00,710
'I had an accident in here two days ago and
I need to talk to the manager for just a minute.

725
00:47:00,710 --> 00:47:01,710
Do you mind if we go in for a moment?'

726
00:47:01,710 --> 00:47:02,710
Cristina asked Philippe.

727
00:47:02,710 --> 00:47:03,710
'That's fine.

728
00:47:03,710 --> 00:47:04,710
I'd be interested to see inside,' said Philippe.

729
00:47:04,710 --> 00:47:05,710
They went in and walked past Florencia, the
receptionist.

730
00:47:05,710 --> 00:47:06,710
She smiled at Cristina but stopped Philippe.

731
00:47:06,710 --> 00:47:07,710
'Excuse me,' she said.

732
00:47:07,710 --> 00:47:08,710
'I need to see your club card, if you don't
mind.'

733
00:47:08,710 --> 00:47:09,710
'He's a friend of mine,' said Cristina.

734
00:47:09,710 --> 00:47:10,710
'We just wanted to talk to Daniel for a moment.'

735
00:47:10,710 --> 00:47:11,710
'I'm sorry.

736
00:47:11,710 --> 00:47:12,710
That's OK,' said Florencia and she phoned
Daniel's office to tell him he had visitors.

737
00:47:12,710 --> 00:47:13,710
Cristina found Daniel and introduced him to
Philippe.

738
00:47:13,710 --> 00:47:14,710
They talked for a moment about the gym and
their jobs.

739
00:47:14,710 --> 00:47:15,710
Then Daniel turned to Cristina.

740
00:47:15,710 --> 00:47:16,710
'I wanted to show you the names of people
who came here in the last few days.

741
00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:17,710
The only problem is that we don't have the
names of the people who bought day tickets.'

742
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:18,710
Cristina looked at the names but there was
nobody she knew.

743
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:19,710
'I'm sure I don't know the man,' she said.

744
00:47:19,710 --> 00:47:20,710
'I didn't see him clearly but I'm sure I don't
know him.'

745
00:47:20,710 --> 00:47:21,710
'OK,' said Daniel.

746
00:47:21,710 --> 00:47:22,710
'Florencia isn't sure either, but I'll talk
to some more people.

747
00:47:22,710 --> 00:47:23,710
Maybe somebody else saw this man.'

748
00:47:23,710 --> 00:47:24,710
'Thanks, Daniel,' said Cristina.

749
00:47:24,710 --> 00:47:25,710
'I'll see you soon.

750
00:47:25,710 --> 00:47:26,710
'Nice to meet you,' Philippe said to Daniel.

751
00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:27,710
Daniel shook his hand and smiled.

752
00:47:27,710 --> 00:47:28,710
'And you,' he said.

753
00:47:28,710 --> 00:47:29,710
Daniel watched the two of them leave.

754
00:47:29,710 --> 00:47:30,710
He would like to be with someone tonight and
thought about his girlfriend back in Rosario.

755
00:47:30,710 --> 00:47:31,710
Cristina and Philippe walked out of the front
door of the gym together.

756
00:47:31,710 --> 00:47:32,710
'Let's get a taxi to the Plaza de Mayo from
here,' said Cristina.

757
00:47:32,710 --> 00:47:33,710
'OK, and on the way you must tell me more
about this accident,' said Philippe.

758
00:47:33,710 --> 00:47:34,710
'It sounds like a strange story.'

759
00:47:34,710 --> 00:47:35,710
They stopped at the side of the road to look
for a taxi.

760
00:47:35,710 --> 00:47:36,710
There were always black and yellow taxis around
but sometimes it was difficult for them to

761
00:47:36,710 --> 00:47:37,710
stop in the heavy traffic.

762
00:47:37,710 --> 00:47:38,710
Suddenly an old Peugeot 504, which was parked
on Avenida del Libertador, started and drove

763
00:47:38,710 --> 00:47:39,710
towards them.

764
00:47:39,710 --> 00:47:40,710
Cristina was looking for a taxi when she saw
the Peugeot coming right at them.

765
00:47:40,710 --> 00:47:41,710
She shouted and pulled Philippe back from
the road, but it was too late - the car hit

766
00:47:41,710 --> 00:47:42,710
Philippe and then drove away along the Avenida.

767
00:47:42,710 --> 00:47:43,710
CHAPTER EIGHT
Getting help

768
00:47:43,710 --> 00:47:44,710
An hour later Cristina was sitting on a chair
in Philippe's hospital room.

769
00:47:44,710 --> 00:47:45,710
She was listening to the doctor, who was talking
to Philippe.

770
00:47:45,710 --> 00:47:46,710
The doctor told Philippe that he was lucky.

771
00:47:46,710 --> 00:47:47,710
His leg was badly cut but not broken.

772
00:47:47,710 --> 00:47:48,710
The doctor's words gave Cristina a strange
feeling.

773
00:47:48,710 --> 00:47:49,710
When she was in the hospital the doctor had
used the same word: "lucky".

774
00:47:49,710 --> 00:47:50,710
She stood up and looked out of the window.

775
00:47:50,710 --> 00:47:51,710
The street below looked the same as on any
other day.

776
00:47:51,710 --> 00:47:52,710
'Is it me?'

777
00:47:52,710 --> 00:47:53,710
she thought.

778
00:47:53,710 --> 00:47:54,710
'Is it bad luck or is somebody really trying
to hurt me?'

779
00:47:54,710 --> 00:47:55,710
The doctor left and Cristina said, 'It wasn't
a great evening in the city, I'm afraid.

780
00:47:55,710 --> 00:47:56,710
How are you feeling?'

781
00:47:56,710 --> 00:47:57,710
There was no color in Philippe's face.

782
00:47:57,710 --> 00:47:58,710
'I'm OK,' he said quietly.

783
00:47:58,710 --> 00:47:59,710
He drank a little water from the glass by
his bed.

784
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:00,710
He looked at Cristina and tried to smile.

785
00:48:00,710 --> 00:48:01,710
'I'm not sure why, but 1 don't think that
was really an accident,' he said.

786
00:48:01,710 --> 00:48:02,710
Cristina agreed.

787
00:48:02,710 --> 00:48:03,710
'I've got a bad feeling too.

788
00:48:03,710 --> 00:48:04,710
We'll talk about it later.

789
00:48:04,710 --> 00:48:05,710
You must rest now.

790
00:48:05,710 --> 00:48:06,710
Is there anybody you want me to phone for
you?'

791
00:48:06,710 --> 00:48:07,710
'Don't worry.

792
00:48:07,710 --> 00:48:08,710
I'll phone the museum in Paris in the morning,'
Philippe said.

793
00:48:08,710 --> 00:48:09,710
Cristina wanted to kiss Philippe.

794
00:48:09,710 --> 00:48:10,710
His sad face looked so beautiful.

795
00:48:10,710 --> 00:48:11,710
She was falling in love and she knew it.

796
00:48:11,710 --> 00:48:12,710
But first she had to find out what was happening,
why someone wanted to kill her and to stop

797
00:48:12,710 --> 00:48:13,710
them.

798
00:48:13,710 --> 00:48:14,710
She needed to speak to Daniel.

799
00:48:14,710 --> 00:48:15,710
She walked quietly out of the room and went
to look for the nearest phone box.

800
00:48:15,710 --> 00:48:16,710
Cristina now felt that things were different.

801
00:48:16,710 --> 00:48:17,710
She could believe that she had had one accident
in the gym but now this...?

802
00:48:17,710 --> 00:48:18,710
She tried to think.

803
00:48:18,710 --> 00:48:19,710
Why would somebody want to kill her?

804
00:48:19,710 --> 00:48:20,710
She wasn't rich, she had no problems at work,
she didn't know many people in the city center.

805
00:48:20,710 --> 00:48:21,710
Why her?

806
00:48:21,710 --> 00:48:22,710
She put some money into the phone and called
the gym.

807
00:48:22,710 --> 00:48:23,710
'Hi, Florencia.

808
00:48:23,710 --> 00:48:24,710
It's Cristina.

809
00:48:24,710 --> 00:48:25,710
Can I speak to Daniel please?'

810
00:48:25,710 --> 00:48:26,710
'Of course,' Florencia said.

811
00:48:26,710 --> 00:48:27,710
'Hi, Cristina.

812
00:48:27,710 --> 00:48:28,710
Daniel speaking.'

813
00:48:28,710 --> 00:48:29,710
'Hello, Daniel.

814
00:48:29,710 --> 00:48:30,710
I'm sorry to phone you like this but I need
your help.

815
00:48:30,710 --> 00:48:31,710
Did you see the accident outside the gym?

816
00:48:31,710 --> 00:48:32,710
My friend was hurt.

817
00:48:32,710 --> 00:48:33,710
Somebody tried to kill us, in a car.

818
00:48:33,710 --> 00:48:34,710
This time I'm sure.

819
00:48:34,710 --> 00:48:35,710
They drove straight at us.

820
00:48:35,710 --> 00:48:36,710
I'm at the hospital now.

821
00:48:36,710 --> 00:48:37,710
Philippe's hurt but nothing's broken.'

822
00:48:37,710 --> 00:48:38,710
'Wait, wait.

823
00:48:38,710 --> 00:48:39,710
What happened?'

824
00:48:39,710 --> 00:48:40,710
Daniel asked.

825
00:48:40,710 --> 00:48:41,710
He sounded worried.

826
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:42,710
'I didn't see anything.

827
00:48:42,710 --> 00:48:43,710
I can't believe it.

828
00:48:43,710 --> 00:48:44,710
Are you sure somebody tried to kill you?'

829
00:48:44,710 --> 00:48:45,710
'I know it's true this time.

830
00:48:45,710 --> 00:48:46,710
I'm sorry, Daniel.

831
00:48:46,710 --> 00:48:47,710
I need help.

832
00:48:47,710 --> 00:48:48,710
I'm really afraid now,' said Cristina.

833
00:48:48,710 --> 00:48:49,710
'OK, Cristina.

834
00:48:49,710 --> 00:48:50,710
Just tell me where you are and I'll come and
find you.

835
00:48:50,710 --> 00:48:51,710
Then we'll decide what to do next.'

836
00:48:51,710 --> 00:48:52,710
Cristina gave him the name of the hospital
and thanked him.

837
00:48:52,710 --> 00:48:53,710
Her hands felt cold and dry.

838
00:48:53,710 --> 00:48:54,710
She wanted to cry but she stopped herself.

839
00:48:54,710 --> 00:48:55,710
She went back to Philippe's room.

840
00:48:55,710 --> 00:48:56,710
Daniel put down the phone but then he picked
it up again.

841
00:48:56,710 --> 00:48:57,710
He phoned a friend of his cousin's who was
a policeman.

842
00:48:57,710 --> 00:48:58,710
Daniel knew him quite well because he came
to the gym twice a week.

843
00:48:58,710 --> 00:48:59,710
Daniel told the policeman the story about
Cristina.

844
00:48:59,710 --> 00:49:00,710
He then told him that he was now going to
get Cristina from the hospital and take her

845
00:49:00,710 --> 00:49:01,710
to the police station.

846
00:49:01,710 --> 00:49:02,710
The policeman thought for a moment and then
asked him to change his plans.

847
00:49:02,710 --> 00:49:03,710
He told Daniel to take Cristina home.

848
00:49:03,710 --> 00:49:04,710
He believed that the man who wanted to kill
her could try to follow her.

849
00:49:04,710 --> 00:49:05,710
Daniel agreed.

850
00:49:05,710 --> 00:49:06,710
He left his office and drove to the hospital.

851
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:07,710
In the hospital car park, Roberto and Carlos
were sitting in a car talking.

852
00:49:07,710 --> 00:49:08,710
They knew that Cristina was in the hospital.

853
00:49:08,710 --> 00:49:09,710
They had followed the ambulance there and
seen her get out with the man who hurt his

854
00:49:09,710 --> 00:49:10,710
leg.

855
00:49:10,710 --> 00:49:11,710
'This time we'll get her,' Roberto said.

856
00:49:11,710 --> 00:49:12,710
Carlos was getting more and more afraid.

857
00:49:12,710 --> 00:49:13,710
He wanted to leave the city and drive towards
the north of Argentina.

858
00:49:13,710 --> 00:49:14,710
They had a cousin who lived in Tucuman, one
thousand three hundred kilometers north of

859
00:49:14,710 --> 00:49:15,710
Buenos Aires.

860
00:49:15,710 --> 00:49:16,710
They could stay with him.

861
00:49:16,710 --> 00:49:17,710
But Roberto didn't want to leave until he
knew Cristina was dead.

862
00:49:17,710 --> 00:49:18,710
'The police will find her, Carlos, and she'll
talk.

863
00:49:18,710 --> 00:49:19,710
Or maybe she has already talked to them and
they are looking for us now.

864
00:49:19,710 --> 00:49:20,710
If we're in Buenos Ares, they'll find us.

865
00:49:20,710 --> 00:49:21,710
Too many people know us.

866
00:49:21,710 --> 00:49:22,710
Somebody will talk.'

867
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:23,710
Carlos knew his brother was right but he was
afraid.

868
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:24,710
'So what do we do now, Roberto?

869
00:49:24,710 --> 00:49:25,710
How can we kill her?'

870
00:49:25,710 --> 00:49:26,710
'We have to follow her and kill her - with
a gun.

871
00:49:26,710 --> 00:49:27,710
We'll wait for her here.

872
00:49:27,710 --> 00:49:28,710
Then when she comes out, we'll follow her
and we'll kill her.

873
00:49:28,710 --> 00:49:29,710
It doesn't have to look like an accident.

874
00:49:29,710 --> 00:49:30,710
We'll be quick.

875
00:49:30,710 --> 00:49:31,710
Nobody will see us.

876
00:49:31,710 --> 00:49:32,710
We'll just kill her.'

877
00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:33,710
'I don't think I can do that,' said Carlos
quietly.

878
00:49:33,710 --> 00:49:34,710
'No, you drive the car, I'll do it.

879
00:49:34,710 --> 00:49:35,710
She has to leave this place at some time.

880
00:49:35,710 --> 00:49:36,710
We'll sit here until she does.'

881
00:49:36,710 --> 00:49:37,710
The brothers didn't see Daniel's car as he
drove into the car park but they saw Cristina.

882
00:49:37,710 --> 00:49:38,710
She came out of the front door of the hospital
and ran towards Daniel.

883
00:49:38,710 --> 00:49:39,710
The two of them went back inside the hospital.

884
00:49:39,710 --> 00:49:40,710
'Come on, let's go and see Philippe and tell
him where we'll be,' said Daniel.

885
00:49:40,710 --> 00:49:41,710
'Where will we be?' asked Cristina.

886
00:49:41,710 --> 00:49:42,710
'With the police.'

887
00:49:42,710 --> 00:49:43,710
You're a good friend, Daniel,' Cristina said
as they walked to Philippe's room.

888
00:49:43,710 --> 00:49:44,710
Daniel was like a family friend.

889
00:49:44,710 --> 00:49:45,710
Cristina couldn't believe it.

890
00:49:45,710 --> 00:49:46,710
In a very short time, two men had come into
her life.

891
00:49:46,710 --> 00:49:47,710
One was now a very good friend and the other?

892
00:49:47,710 --> 00:49:48,710
She must wait and see.

893
00:49:48,710 --> 00:49:49,710
Philippe looked a little better when they
returned.

894
00:49:49,710 --> 00:49:50,710
He even smiled a little.

895
00:49:50,710 --> 00:49:51,710
'Hi, Philippe,' Daniel said.

896
00:49:51,710 --> 00:49:52,710
'I'm so sorry about the accident.

897
00:49:52,710 --> 00:49:53,710
I'm just going to take Cristina to talk to
the police.

898
00:49:53,710 --> 00:49:54,710
I think she needs to tell them her story.'

899
00:49:54,710 --> 00:49:55,710
Philippe agreed.

900
00:49:55,710 --> 00:49:56,710
'I'll go back to the hotel as soon as I can.

901
00:49:56,710 --> 00:49:57,710
Don't come back here.

902
00:49:57,710 --> 00:49:58,710
It could be dangerous.

903
00:49:58,710 --> 00:49:59,710
I'll leave you a message when I'm back in
my hotel room.'

904
00:49:59,710 --> 00:50:00,710
'Be careful, Philippe.

905
00:50:00,710 --> 00:50:01,710
I'll come to the hotel when I hear from you,'
Cristina said.

906
00:50:01,710 --> 00:50:02,710
'I'll be OK.

907
00:50:02,710 --> 00:50:03,710
You be careful too.

908
00:50:03,710 --> 00:50:04,710
I'll need you to look after my paintings,'
said Philippe.

909
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:05,710
CHAPTER NINE
Remembering everything

910
00:50:05,710 --> 00:50:06,710
Cristina got into Daniel's car.

911
00:50:06,710 --> 00:50:07,710
'We're going to the police, are we?

912
00:50:07,710 --> 00:50:08,710
Which police station?'

913
00:50:08,710 --> 00:50:09,710
she asked.

914
00:50:09,710 --> 00:50:10,710
'We're going to your flat,' Daniel replied.

915
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:11,710
'The police will be there.

916
00:50:11,710 --> 00:50:12,710
They are hoping that the person who tried
to kill you will follow us.

917
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:13,710
They want to get him.

918
00:50:13,710 --> 00:50:14,710
We'll go down Avenida de Libertador.'

919
00:50:14,710 --> 00:50:15,710
Daniel drove the car out of the hospital car
park but he didn't see the blue Peugeot leave

920
00:50:15,710 --> 00:50:16,710
the car park behind them.

921
00:50:16,710 --> 00:50:17,710
Daniel turned into Avenida del Libertador.

922
00:50:17,710 --> 00:50:18,710
The blue Peugeot turned into the same road
a few seconds later and moved to the left

923
00:50:18,710 --> 00:50:19,710
hand side.

924
00:50:19,710 --> 00:50:20,710
Cristina looked around her.

925
00:50:20,710 --> 00:50:21,710
She couldn't believe that less than a month
before she was riding her motorbike down this

926
00:50:21,710 --> 00:50:22,710
Avenida every morning and every evening without
a care in the world.

927
00:50:22,710 --> 00:50:23,710
Now she had no motorbike and lots of problems.

928
00:50:23,710 --> 00:50:24,710
Daniel drove slowly through the heavy traffic.

929
00:50:24,710 --> 00:50:25,710
There were a lot of people around as usual.

930
00:50:25,710 --> 00:50:26,710
Many of them were on their way to have dinner
in the restaurants of Recoleta.

931
00:50:26,710 --> 00:50:27,710
People in Buenos Aires never really have dinner
before ten o'clock in the evening and the

932
00:50:27,710 --> 00:50:28,710
city center was busy until at least three
o'clock in the morning.

933
00:50:28,710 --> 00:50:29,710
All the traffic lights were red.

934
00:50:29,710 --> 00:50:30,710
It was always the same.

935
00:50:30,710 --> 00:50:31,710
She looked at Daniel beside her.

936
00:50:31,710 --> 00:50:32,710
He looked tired and worried.

937
00:50:32,710 --> 00:50:33,710
He wanted to get Cristina to the police quickly.

938
00:50:33,710 --> 00:50:34,710
He slowed down at some traffic lights as they
were changing to red.

939
00:50:34,710 --> 00:50:35,710
Cristina turned her head and looked into the
car next to them.

940
00:50:35,710 --> 00:50:36,710
She saw two men.

941
00:50:36,710 --> 00:50:37,710
The man who was driving the car was looking
at the road in front of him.

942
00:50:37,710 --> 00:50:38,710
The man sitting next to him looked out of
the window at Cristina.

943
00:50:38,710 --> 00:50:39,710
She looked into his eyes and she couldn't
look away.

944
00:50:39,710 --> 00:50:40,710
She looked into the dark brown eyes of that
man and for a moment he looked back.

945
00:50:40,710 --> 00:50:41,710
Then he turned his head and she saw the tattoo
of the red poppy on his neck.

946
00:50:41,710 --> 00:50:42,710
Suddenly Cristina remembered everything.

947
00:50:42,710 --> 00:50:43,710
She remembered the eyes of the man and the
red flower on his neck, the poppy.

948
00:50:43,710 --> 00:50:44,710
She remembered the car and the sound of the
police cars.

949
00:50:44,710 --> 00:50:45,710
She knew that these were the same men who
had tried to kill her in the gym.

950
00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:46,710
The same men who had driven their car at Philippe.

951
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:47,710
And then she remembered the gun.

952
00:50:47,710 --> 00:50:48,710
The same gun that the man was picking up now.

953
00:50:48,710 --> 00:50:49,710
The same man, the same gun.

954
00:50:49,710 --> 00:50:50,710
The same red flowers in the field of the painting
she loved.

955
00:50:50,710 --> 00:50:51,710
'Go, Daniel!

956
00:50:51,710 --> 00:50:52,710
Move!

957
00:50:52,710 --> 00:50:53,710
He's got a gun!

958
00:50:53,710 --> 00:50:54,710
He's going to kill us!'

959
00:50:54,710 --> 00:50:55,710
she shouted.

960
00:50:55,710 --> 00:50:56,710
Daniel drove through the red light and on
down the Avenida.

961
00:50:56,710 --> 00:50:57,710
The other car followed.

962
00:50:57,710 --> 00:50:58,710
Daniel didn't have much time to think.

963
00:50:58,710 --> 00:50:59,710
He drove along the Avenida as fast as he could.

964
00:50:59,710 --> 00:51:00,710
'What shall I do?' he asked Cristina.

965
00:51:00,710 --> 00:51:01,710
'Turn into Calle Montevideo.

966
00:51:01,710 --> 00:51:02,710
We'll go past my flat.

967
00:51:02,710 --> 00:51:03,710
That's what the police wanted.

968
00:51:03,710 --> 00:51:04,710
I'm sure they'll be there,' answered Cristina.

969
00:51:04,710 --> 00:51:05,710
The Peugeot was still following them.

970
00:51:05,710 --> 00:51:06,710
Daniel turned into Calle Montevideo.

971
00:51:06,710 --> 00:51:07,710
Cristina saw the two light and dark blue police
cars parked across the road near her flat.

972
00:51:07,710 --> 00:51:08,710
'Slow down, Daniel.

973
00:51:08,710 --> 00:51:09,710
Stop here.

974
00:51:09,710 --> 00:51:10,710
It's OK.

975
00:51:10,710 --> 00:51:11,710
We'll be OK.'

976
00:51:11,710 --> 00:51:12,710
Daniel stopped the car suddenly and pushed
Cristina down onto the floor of the car.

977
00:51:12,710 --> 00:51:13,710
The Peugeot behind was going so fast that
Carlos couldn't stop it.

978
00:51:13,710 --> 00:51:14,710
He tried but the car turned right and left
and right again.

979
00:51:14,710 --> 00:51:15,710
Then it hit one of the police cars and turned
over.

980
00:51:15,710 --> 00:51:16,710
There was a lot of noise.

981
00:51:16,710 --> 00:51:17,710
People were shouting.

982
00:51:17,710 --> 00:51:18,710
Cristina wanted to look out but Daniel said,
'Stay there.

983
00:51:18,710 --> 00:51:19,710
It could still be dangerous.'

984
00:51:19,710 --> 00:51:20,710
After another long minute it was quiet and
two policemen came to open the door of Daniel's

985
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:21,710
car.

986
00:51:21,710 --> 00:51:22,710
'You can come out now.

987
00:51:22,710 --> 00:51:23,710
It's safe,' one of them said.

988
00:51:23,710 --> 00:51:24,710
Then they heard the sound of an ambulance.

989
00:51:24,710 --> 00:51:25,710
It came into the street and stopped near the
Peugeot.

990
00:51:25,710 --> 00:51:26,710
Cristina stood still.

991
00:51:26,710 --> 00:51:27,710
She didn't want to watch but she couldn't
stop herself.

992
00:51:27,710 --> 00:51:28,710
The police pulled a body from the Peugeot.

993
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:29,710
Cristina couldn't see if the man was alive
or dead but she could see the blood.

994
00:51:29,710 --> 00:51:30,710
Men carried the body to the ambulance.

995
00:51:30,710 --> 00:51:31,710
When the door was closed, the ambulance drove
off to the hospital.

996
00:51:31,710 --> 00:51:32,710
Cristina could see the other man, the man
without the tattoo of a poppy, sitting in

997
00:51:32,710 --> 00:51:33,710
the police car.

998
00:51:33,710 --> 00:51:34,710
Six months later Cristina was standing in
the main room in the museum.

999
00:51:34,710 --> 00:51:35,710
It was the first night of the Impressionist
exhibition.

1000
00:51:35,710 --> 00:51:36,710
She was wearing a short black dress and her
dark hair fell around her shoulders.

1001
00:51:36,710 --> 00:51:37,710
Music was playing.

1002
00:51:37,710 --> 00:51:38,710
Cristina looked around.

1003
00:51:38,710 --> 00:51:39,710
Her parents were there, talking together and
drinking champagne.

1004
00:51:39,710 --> 00:51:40,710
Daniel was there with his girlfriend from
Rosario.

1005
00:51:40,710 --> 00:51:41,710
After a few minutes the music stopped and
everybody was quiet.

1006
00:51:41,710 --> 00:51:42,710
They all stopped talking.

1007
00:51:42,710 --> 00:51:43,710
Leonardo Martinez, the museum director, started
to talk:

1008
00:51:43,710 --> 00:51:44,710
'Ladies and gentlemen.

1009
00:51:44,710 --> 00:51:45,710
I am so pleased to welcome you to this important
Impressionist exhibition.

1010
00:51:45,710 --> 00:51:46,710
We have never before had this number of Impressionist
paintings in Buenos Aires...'

1011
00:51:46,710 --> 00:51:47,710
Cristina felt a hand on her arm.

1012
00:51:47,710 --> 00:51:48,710
She knew that hand.

1013
00:51:48,710 --> 00:51:49,710
It was Philippe.

1014
00:51:49,710 --> 00:51:50,710
He had come back to Buenos Aires often while
they were organizing the exhibition and they

1015
00:51:50,710 --> 00:51:51,710
had spent a lot of time together.

1016
00:51:51,710 --> 00:51:52,710
Philippe spoke quietly in Cristina's ear,
'It's really happening.

1017
00:51:52,710 --> 00:51:53,710
Your parents and friends are here.

1018
00:51:53,710 --> 00:51:54,710
The paintings are here.

1019
00:51:54,710 --> 00:51:55,710
Monet's poppies are here.

1020
00:51:55,710 --> 00:51:56,710
And we're here together to see them too.'

1021
00:51:56,710 --> 00:51:57,710
'I know.

1022
00:51:57,710 --> 00:51:58,710
It's wonderful.

1023
00:51:58,710 --> 00:51:59,710
I wish you and your paintings could stay here
forever.'

1024
00:51:59,710 --> 00:52:00,710
'No, I have to go home.

1025
00:52:00,710 --> 00:52:01,710
But I want to ask you something.

1026
00:52:01,710 --> 00:52:02,710
When I take my paintings home, will you come
with me?'

1027
00:52:02,710 --> 00:52:03,710
Cristina smiled at him with love in her eyes
and nodded her head.

1028
00:52:03,710 --> 00:52:03,712
- THE END -
