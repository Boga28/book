1
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:00,860
ants and an expensive watch.

2
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:03,620
Everything was worth about $15,000."

3
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:06,910
"Don't tell me all this!" said Wood.

4
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:09,510
"Oh, it's all right," said Kernan.

5
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:12,910
"Everything is in my suitcase at the hotel.

6
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:15,790
And now I'll tell you why I'm talking.

7
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:17,520
Because it's safe.

8
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:20,330
I'm talking to a man I know.

9
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:23,890
You owe me a thousand dollars, Barney Woods.

10
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:25,470
You won't arrest me."

11
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:27,550
"I remember," said Woods.

12
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:30,720
"You gave me one thousand dollars.

13
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,330
One day I'll pay back the money.

14
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:35,220
The thousand dollars saved me.

15
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:39,660
They were putting my furniture out on the
street when I got home that night."

16
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:45,690
"You're a good, honest man," continued Kernan,
"and you can't arrest me because you owe me

17
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:46,989
money."

18
00:03:46,989 --> 00:03:50,000
The waiter came and brought them some drinks.

19
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,420
Woods looked at the little gold pencil and
said, "I can't arrest you.

20
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:56,430
I didn't pay back the thousand dollars.

21
00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:02,799
It's a bad situation for me, but you helped
me once, Johnny, and now I must do the same."

22
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,140
"I knew it," said Kernan smiling.

23
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:08,320
"I can judge men, Woods."

24
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:14,280
"I'm silent only because I owe you money,
otherwise you couldn't escape!" said Woods.

25
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,620
"I know I couldn't," said Kernan.

26
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:19,320
"That's why I knew I was safe with you."

27
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:24,080
"You see, Kernan, I'm a man first and then
a detective.

28
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,260
And now I'll let you go and I'll leave the
New York City Police.

29
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,320
I'll probably go and drive a truck.

30
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,010
I'll never be able to pay back the thousand
dollars."

31
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:36,520
"Oh, you can keep it," said Kernan.

32
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:39,510
"But I know you want to pay it back one day.

33
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:42,450
I was lucky that you borrowed it.

34
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:44,460
But let's change the subject.

35
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:47,660
Tomorrow I'm going to the West on the train.

36
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:51,070
I know a place where I can sell the jewels.

37
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:54,510
Have another drink, Barney, and forget your
problems.

38
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:56,430
Let's have fun tonight!

39
00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:00,420
I'm in the hands of my old friend, Barney
Woods."

40
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:05,880
All evening Kernan told Woods many stories
about his successful wrongdoings and clever

41
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,180
criminal plans.

42
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:11,140
Woods became very irritated by this vicious
man.

43
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:13,330
"Be very careful, Kernan.

44
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:18,460
The newspapers could write about the Norcross
case again, because there were a lot of burglaries

45
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:21,390
and murders in New York this summer."

46
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:23,080
Kernan suddenly became angry.

47
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:26,210
"I don't care about the newspapers.

48
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:28,030
What can the newspapers do?

49
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:31,860
They can send reporters and photographers
to the scene of the crime.

50
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:35,050
They can write about it, but they can't catch
the burglar."

51
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:38,830
"Well, I don't know," said Woods slowly.

52
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:41,570
"Some newspapers do very good work.

53
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:43,530
There's the Morning Mars for example.

54
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:47,000
They helped to catch a criminal when the police
forgot about him."

55
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,120
"I'll show you," said Kernan, getting up confidently.

56
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:55,490
"I'll show you what I think of newspapers
in general and the Morning Mars in particular."

57
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:58,640
There was a telephone booth near their table.

58
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:02,050
Kernan went inside the booth and left the
door open.

59
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:05,790
He found a number in the telephone book and
phoned.

60
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:10,550
Woods sat quietly and looked at Kernan's cold
and arrogant face.

61
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:11,930
He listened carefully.

62
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:14,169
"Hello, the Morning Mars?

63
00:06:14,169 --> 00:06:16,460
I want to speak to the editor."

64
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:19,850
He waited a few moments with his vicious little
smile.

65
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:21,490
"Are you the editor?

66
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:24,900
I am the man who killed old Norcross.

67
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:25,900
Wait!

68
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:29,030
This is not the usual crank call.

69
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:31,530
I killed the old man at 2.30 a.m.

70
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:33,390
Two weeks ago.

71
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:34,810
What?

72
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:36,090
You don't believe me?

73
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:38,130
You don't understand!

74
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:43,169
I'm giving you the biggest scoop in the history
of your boring, little newspaper.

75
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:44,470
What?

76
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:45,770
Really?

77
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:50,780
Well, you can't expect me to give you my name
and address, can you?

78
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:53,710
No, this is not a rival newspaper!

79
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:57,910
I killed old Norcross and I have the jewels
in a suitcase.

80
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:01,070
Well, I'm not going to tell you the name of
the hotel.

81
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:06,870
Now, listen, half of the second button on
Mrs Norcross' nightgown is broken.

82
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:10,090
I saw it when took the ring off her finger."

83
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:14,380
Kernan looked at Woods and said, "He believes
me now."

84
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:17,080
Then he started talking on the phone again.

85
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,720
"Hello, yes, I'm here.

86
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:23,240
What, you want to catch me in forty - eight
hours?

87
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,030
Stop being foolish!

88
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:30,870
Just continue writing your stories about divorces,
accidents and the dirty scandals you write

89
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:32,160
about."

90
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,120
Kernan hung up the phone and said, "He's really
furious now.

91
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,070
Well, Barney, let's go and enjoy ourselves
tonight!

92
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:43,310
We can have dinner and see a musical comedy.

93
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:48,870
I only need four hours sleep and then I'm
going West."

94
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:54,530
Kernan and Woods had dinner in a Broadway
restaurant and went to see a musical comedy.

95
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:56,740
Kernan spent a lot of money.

96
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:01,590
At half past three in the morning they went
to an all-night cafe.

97
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:05,210
Kernan continued talking in his fast, arrogant
manner.

98
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:10,390
Woods listened and thought sadly about the
end of his career as a detective.

99
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:12,910
But suddenly his eyes became bright.

100
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:16,020
"I wonder if it's possible," he thought.

101
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:20,750
"I won-der if it's possible!"

102
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:25,590
Outside it was early morning, The big city
was waking up.

103
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:29,250
Woods could hear the first noises of the day.

104
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:36,599
One of the noises were the cries of the newspaper
boys with the latest news - the Clarion Call.

105
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:41,199
Woods gave ten cents to a waiter and said,
"Buy me a Morning Mars, please."

106
00:08:41,199 --> 00:08:44,829
When he got the paper he looked at the first
page.

107
00:08:44,829 --> 00:08:49,130
Then he took a page out of his little notebook
and began writing with a little gold pencil.

108
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:52,230
"What's the news?" asked Kernan.

109
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:54,680
Woods showed him the piece of paper:

110
00:08:54,680 --> 00:09:01,120
Please pay to John Kernan the thousand-dollar
reward that is mine for his arrest Barnard

111
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,120
Woods

112
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:07,411
"You teased them so much on the phone and
they put YOU on the first page of the Morning

113
00:09:07,411 --> 00:09:08,411
Mars'.

114
00:09:08,411 --> 00:09:11,960
Now, Johnny, you'll come to the police station
with me."

115
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,090
- THE END -
