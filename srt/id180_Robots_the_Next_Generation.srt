00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,759
CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:01,759 --> 00:00:06,490
Robots and Japan
IF IN THE FUTURE YOU BUY A HOUSEHOLD ROBOT,

3
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:09,760
THE CHANCES ARE IT WILL BE JAPANESE

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,880
Japan is famous for its long tradition of
automatons, or machines that look and act

5
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,950
like humans.

6
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:21,349
In the 18th and 19th centuries, realistic
human models, known as Karakuri ningyo, or

7
00:00:21,349 --> 00:00:26,640
"dolls that trick," were seen in homes, theaters,
and religious ceremonies.

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,949
The most common example was a small model
of a woman in a kimono that served cups of

9
00:00:30,949 --> 00:00:33,110
tea to guests.

10
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:36,610
These sophisticated dolls became highly popular.

11
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:41,620
Interestingly, the great engineer Tanaka Hisashige,
founder of the company that would eventually

12
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:47,140
become TOSHIBA, actually started his career
in the early 19th century as a maker of Karakuri

13
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:48,780
dolls.

14
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,470
But Japan did not invent automatons.

15
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:55,870
In fact, they have been with us for thousands
of years.

16
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:59,870
The word automaton comes from the Greek "it
moves itself."

17
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:04,530
The 1st-century Greek inventor Hero was famous
for his automated machines, which included

18
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:07,420
moving dancers and fountains.

19
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:12,259
There are also many stories from ancient China
of wooden automatons that sang, danced, or

20
00:01:12,259 --> 00:01:13,830
served drinks.

21
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:19,310
Later, in the 12th century, the Islamic scholar
Al-Jazari wrote a whole book on mechanisms

22
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:24,560
and automatons, which included clocks, animals,
a waitress, and even a programmable musical

23
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,920
band complete with flute-player and drummer!

24
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,710
The English word robot comes from the Czech
language and means "to serve."

25
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:38,380
It was first used in the 1920s in a play by
the Czech writer Karel Capek, titled R.U.R.

26
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:40,950
(Rossum's Universal Robots).

27
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:46,859
The play showed a futuristic world where human-like
machines did all the work.

28
00:01:46,859 --> 00:01:51,069
In Capek's play these machines could think
and feel, and eventually they rebelled against

29
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:53,170
their human rulers.

30
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:57,710
By the 1920s in Japan robots were starting
to appear in department stores.

31
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:03,390
At first, however, they were not much more
than complicated Karakuri.

32
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:09,649
The first Japanese humanoid robot was created
in 1928 and was called Gakutensoku, or "Learning

33
00:02:09,649 --> 00:02:11,819
from the Laws of Nature."

34
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:16,310
It was a Buddha-like model that used air to
move its head and hands.

35
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:22,420
Its creator, the biologist Makoto Nishimura,
believed these machines were part of nature.

36
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:27,010
He is quoted as saying, "If one considers
humans as the children of nature, artificial

37
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:31,390
humans created by the hand of man are thus
nature's grandchildren."

38
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:35,860
His robot became a huge success and toured
Asia and Europe.

39
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:40,549
Nishimura's opinions highlight the Japanese
attitude to machines and technology and the

40
00:02:40,549 --> 00:02:43,640
fascination they have with robots.

41
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:48,620
This may be linked to Japan's Shinto religion,
whose followers regard all things as having

42
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:50,150
spirits.

43
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:54,519
Tools and all objects made with tools possess
their own special qualities, almost as if

44
00:02:54,519 --> 00:02:56,980
they were individuals.

45
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:01,430
Certainly the Japanese view of robots is very
different from the views traditionally held

46
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:05,390
in Western cultures, which are often suspicious
of robots.

47
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:10,560
The Japanese look upon robots as things of
interest and beauty, designed to help humans

48
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,099
and make our lives better.

49
00:03:13,099 --> 00:03:18,829
This view was most famously expressed in the
1951 Manga comic, Tetsuwan Atomu.

50
00:03:18,829 --> 00:03:24,630
Atomu, or Astro Boy, as he was later known
in the West, was the first major robot character

51
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:28,050
to show robots as friendly and helpful.

52
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:33,010
The Japanese love of comic book robot characters,
together with the country's fast increasing

53
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:38,780
electronics industry, meant that by the 1980s
Japan had become a world leader in robot research

54
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:40,099
and production.

55
00:03:40,099 --> 00:03:46,469
Today, more than a third of the world's industrial
robots work in factories in Japan.

56
00:03:46,469 --> 00:03:51,519
As well as the typical industrial robots,
many robots are designed simply as toys or

57
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,690
for entertainment.

58
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:59,250
Animal robots, dancing robots, car-driving
robots, even piano- playing robots are all

59
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:02,010
made and sold in Japan.

60
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:07,019
And as technology improves, the differences
between humans and machines may become increasingly

61
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:09,280
blurred.

62
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,560
CHAPTER TWO
Robot and Recreation

63
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,280
FOR THE JAPANESE, ROBOTS ARE A GREAT SOURCE
OF ENTERTAINMENT.

64
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:23,210
Technically, a robot is any kind of autonomous
self-controlled or remote-controlled machine,

65
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:27,419
often used in factories for dangerous or precision
work.

66
00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:32,390
But when we think of a robot, we often imagine
a machine with a recognizably human face and

67
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:33,900
figure.

68
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:38,130
These robots are called androids (from the
Greek for man, andr-) and are specifically

69
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:43,220
designed to have characteristics that make
them more attractive to humans.

70
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:46,710
Japan has a keen interest in humanoid models.

71
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:51,370
Karakuri dolls, for example, were seen as
more than models; they were respected as an

72
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:52,990
art form.

73
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:58,020
The Japanese fascination with robots meant
that in the late 20th century, when huge improvements

74
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:03,400
were being made in motors and computing, many
electronics companies began to design humanoid

75
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:07,030
robots that could interact with people on
a social level.

76
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:11,620
The first entertainment robot with commercial
success was not a humanoid, however, but a

77
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,720
robot dog.

78
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:20,880
Designed as a toy pet and launched in 1999,
Sony's AIBO quickly became popular worldwide.

79
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:26,139
The AIBO (Japanese for "companion") could
walk, could see using cameras, and had special

80
00:05:26,139 --> 00:05:30,620
software that allowed it to develop from puppy
to adult, learning to play and understand

81
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:33,500
up to 100 voice commands.

82
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:38,949
Furthermore, special programmable software
allowed owners to change their AIBO's personality

83
00:05:38,949 --> 00:05:40,199
and behavior.

84
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:45,830
Teams of AIBOs have even played at the annual
RoboCup, a soccer tournament where all the

85
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:50,480
competitors must be autonomous robots.

86
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:53,160
Humanoid robots have proved more difficult
to make.

87
00:05:53,160 --> 00:06:00,160
However, in 2000 Honda finally introduced
its first real humanoid robot, ASIMO.

88
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,660
ASIMO was able to help disabled people move
around more easily.

89
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:09,480
The robot could recognize and respond to human
movements and commands, and was aware of its

90
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,280
environment.

91
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:17,229
It has made many public appearances, talking,
dancing, and even conducting an orchestra.

92
00:06:17,229 --> 00:06:21,970
Its little brother, the QRIO made by Sony,
could run and interact to such an extent that

93
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:25,490
it was also capable of playing in the RoboCup.

94
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:29,830
Although the QRIO was too expensive to be
produced commercially, there are now many

95
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:33,620
different humanoid robots available on the
market.

96
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:38,669
They are generally simpler, more like expensive
remote-controlled toys, but they are all humanoid

97
00:06:38,669 --> 00:06:40,629
and have some degree of autonomy.

98
00:06:40,629 --> 00:06:46,830
The lack of easily available or reasonably-priced
humanoid robots hasn't stopped Japan's robot

99
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:48,250
enthusiasts.

100
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:53,970
DIY robotics has become increasingly popular
in recent years, to such an extent that a

101
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:57,889
robot championship, Robo-One, was started
in 2002.

102
00:06:57,889 --> 00:07:04,470
The championship consists of a series of tasks
that the homemade robots must perform.

103
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:09,440
Tasks include falling from a standing position,
getting up, walking, jumping, and even competing

104
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,410
against other robots in a one-on-one boxing
match.

105
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:16,259
There has also been a Robo-One soccer match.

106
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:21,580
The robots in Robo-One are designed and built
at home by individual designers, but may use

107
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:23,409
commercial parts.

108
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:28,800
Many robots are made from aluminum and powered
by small electric motors.

109
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,750
One problem with two-legged robots is how
to make them walk like us.

110
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:38,240
Robots look awkward when they walk because
they constantly bend their knees.

111
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:44,360
However, in 2011 the Nagoya Institute of Technology
produced the first robot legs modeled on human

112
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,439
biomechanics.

113
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:50,520
So naturally moving humanoids may soon be
a common sight.

114
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:55,800
CHAPTER THREE
Robots and Money

115
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:01,129
JAPAN IS THE THIRD LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE
WORLD AND HAS THE LARGEST ELECTRONICS INDUSTRY,

116
00:08:01,129 --> 00:08:04,389
IN WHICH IT IS CONSIDERED A LEADING INNOVATOR.

117
00:08:04,389 --> 00:08:09,539
The Japanese have traditionally been noted
for the high quality of their craftsmanship.

118
00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:15,289
European travelers arriving in Japan in the
16th and 17th century were amazed at its architecture,

119
00:08:15,289 --> 00:08:17,229
metalwork, and technology.

120
00:08:17,229 --> 00:08:23,030
After the Second World War, the Japanese emphasis
on quality and precision helped to create

121
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:27,800
strong, dynamic industries, innovating in
many areas.

122
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:34,050
Japanese cars and electronics became synonymous
with quality, reliability, and affordability.

123
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:38,750
This led to continuous economic growth for
over 30 years, which leveled off in the late

124
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,780
20th century.

125
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:46,110
As Japan enters the 21st century, the main
problem its economy faces is a shortage of

126
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:51,019
workers, a result of an aging population and
a falling birth rate.

127
00:08:51,019 --> 00:08:55,460
These changes mean that, among other things,
there are fewer workers to earn money or care

128
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:57,040
for the elderly.

129
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:02,410
Many people in Japan believe that the Japanese
robotics industry may be the answer to Japan's

130
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:09,339
challenges, both economically (in 2010, the
worldwide industry was worth $5.6 billion),

131
00:09:09,339 --> 00:09:13,459
but also as a technology that can produce
workers and caregivers for the country's aging

132
00:09:13,459 --> 00:09:15,360
population.

133
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,529
CHAPTER FOUR
Robots and Work

134
00:09:19,529 --> 00:09:23,720
WILL TOMORROW'S ROBOTS BE ABLE TO FULFILL
A SOCIAL ROLE?

135
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:28,950
What can Japan do to solve the problem of
the reduction in its workforce?

136
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:32,990
Traditionally suspicious of foreigners, the
country seems reluctant to relax its strict

137
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:38,970
immigration policy, looking instead to the
robotics industry to provide its workers.

138
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:43,460
What would seem a strange solution in many
other countries seems perfectly normal to

139
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:46,880
the electronics-obsessed Japanese.

140
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:51,570
Robots in Japanese society already carry out
many different roles.

141
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:57,090
Here are a few ways that robots are becoming
a part of everyday life in Japan.

142
00:09:57,090 --> 00:09:58,510
Healthcare

143
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:03,050
One of the main shortages in workers in Japan
at the moment is in healthcare, especially

144
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:04,899
for the elderly.

145
00:10:04,899 --> 00:10:09,610
Although there are many trained nurses available
from other parts of Asia, Japan allows very

146
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:12,339
few immigrants into the country.

147
00:10:12,339 --> 00:10:18,230
Consequently, many robotics firms are looking
at the possibility of robot nurses.

148
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:23,170
Toyota launched four robot nursing models
in 2013.

149
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:27,790
These machines aren't humanoid, but resemble
motorized chairs, designed to help patients

150
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:31,050
move around and get in and out of bed.

151
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:36,760
A highly innovative use of a robot in healthcare
can be found in Tokyo's Cyberdyne gym.

152
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:42,050
Here, users can exercise wearing robotic legs
that recognize impulses made by the brain

153
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:44,750
when the person wants to walk.

154
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:50,709
With practice, people who have problems with
their legs can walk around and do exercises.

155
00:10:50,709 --> 00:10:52,130
Security

156
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:56,240
Several Japanese companies have built security
robots.

157
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:01,070
There are robots to guard houses and offices,
a robot that collects cash from banks, and

158
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:03,920
a robot that can stop criminals.

159
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:10,200
The Tmsuk Company's T-34 is a small, four-wheeled
robot that can be controlled by mobile phone.

160
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:14,200
It can catch thieves by firing a net over
them.

161
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:18,170
Other robots have been used to direct traffic
in Tokyo.

162
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:22,790
And Fujitsu has produced a guide robot for
offices and malls.

163
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:28,670
It recognizes faces and has a touch screen
that people can press for information.

164
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:29,670
Actroids

165
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:35,610
An astounding example of Japanese robot philosophy
can be seen in their development of actroids.

166
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:40,890
A combination of the words actor and android,
these robots are specifically designed to

167
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:44,450
look as believably human as possible.

168
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:47,820
Robot directing traffic in Japan

169
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:54,110
The first actroid, presented at the 2003 International
Robot Convention by the University of Osaka,

170
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:57,029
was modeled on the looks of an average Japanese
woman.

171
00:11:57,029 --> 00:12:02,839
It had realistic silicone skin and could blink,
speak, and breathe, using air to move its

172
00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:04,570
features.

173
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:07,580
Later models are even more realistic.

174
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:12,589
Professor Ishiguro of Osaka University believes
that human acceptance of robots depends on

175
00:12:12,589 --> 00:12:15,520
them having a familiar appearance.

176
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:19,860
In the future, he hopes that these human copies
could be used to represent people in business

177
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:22,700
meetings and in other events.

178
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:27,920
So far, the closest any of the actroids has
come was when HRP-4C starred as a model in

179
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,180
the 2009 Tokyo Fashion Week.

180
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:35,870
CHAPTER FIVE
Robots and Life

181
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:40,120
JAPAN'S RELIGIOUS TRADITIONS HELP ITS PEOPLE
APPRECIATE ROBOTS.

182
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:44,899
Mindless metal boxes, coldly following their
programming to the end, robots are not to

183
00:12:44,899 --> 00:12:45,899
be trusted.

184
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:51,459
This, at least, is the impression you might
get from many Hollywood movies.

185
00:12:51,459 --> 00:12:56,920
Traditionally, robots in Hollywood have generally
played the bad guy, an unforgiving, unstoppable

186
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:01,680
creature of incredible power, usually only
defeated because of its lack of flexibility

187
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,910
and imagination.

188
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:08,079
From movies like Blade Runner and Terminator
to The Matrix, we are often shown a world

189
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:14,640
where, given the opportunity, robots and computers
will enslave humans and try to take over.

190
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:19,279
This view reflects a deep mistrust of machines
in Western culture, a sense of separation

191
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:21,450
from the things we create.

192
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:26,390
However, it is a view not necessarily shared
by other cultures.

193
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:31,250
In Japan, many fictional accounts of robots
are positive.

194
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:36,350
Robots are seen as a force for good, as creators
of a more pleasant society.

195
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:40,029
These different points of view carry over
into everyday life.

196
00:13:40,029 --> 00:13:46,269
An American may see robots as a threat to
his or her job, as an unnecessary complication,

197
00:13:46,269 --> 00:13:48,940
or simply as a useless toy.

198
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:53,120
In Japan the same robot would be seen as a
way to make work easier and more efficient,

199
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,100
and as an interesting companion, as something
fun.

200
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:02,089
This probably explains why there are hundreds
of humanoid robots being developed in Japan,

201
00:14:02,089 --> 00:14:05,490
while in the USA there are currently just
two.

202
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:09,120
So why is there such a difference between
these two points of view?

203
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:14,509
Many people have written about the subject,
both in Japan and abroad.

204
00:14:14,509 --> 00:14:19,790
It seems mainly to be a question of whether
and how much something is seen to be alive.

205
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:25,580
In this respect, Japan's Shinto and Buddhist
heritage plays an important role.

206
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:27,920
Japan's Religious Tradition

207
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:33,459
While Buddhism and Shinto are officially separate,
in reality most people practice them together.

208
00:14:33,459 --> 00:14:39,960
Buddhism, with its belief in the oneness or
unity of all things, was imported from China.

209
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:44,779
Shinto is a set of religious beliefs and practices
native to Japan and was first recorded in

210
00:14:44,779 --> 00:14:47,070
the 8th century.

211
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:52,170
Shinto involves the worship of Kami, which
roughly translates as "spirits."

212
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:57,190
These spirits can be a natural experience,
such as wind or rain, or the spirit of a natural

213
00:14:57,190 --> 00:15:01,579
place, such as a forest or river, or even
rocks.

214
00:15:01,579 --> 00:15:07,010
This recognition of spiritual life in all
things and actions is known as animism.

215
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:11,639
Although Kami can also be the spirits of ancestors
or people, they are not gods in the Western

216
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:13,940
sense of the word.

217
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:17,829
Shinto's main aim is to keep in harmony with
the surrounding world by showing respect for

218
00:15:17,829 --> 00:15:20,330
the kami that inhabit it.

219
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:25,750
In the same way, the tools you use or works
you create possess their own spirit or identity,

220
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:28,110
something worthy of respect.

221
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:33,370
It is not surprising that such a belief would
give rise to a culture of exceptional craftsmen.

222
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:36,540
A Sense of Connection

223
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:40,500
This sense of connection with the things an
artist or designer creates is very different

224
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:47,089
from Western ideas, which sharply divide living,
thinking beings from lifeless machines.

225
00:15:47,089 --> 00:15:51,279
Japanese craftsmen's natural respect for and
appreciation of the machines they create becomes

226
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:55,190
even stronger when applied to a responsive
robot.

227
00:15:55,190 --> 00:16:01,050
In Japan, robots are not seen only as tools
that exist to make human life easier.

228
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:05,910
As one writer has put it, it is no longer
a question of robots doing things for people,

229
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:08,259
but of doing things with them.

230
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:13,240
This is a philosophy that looks into a future
where man and machine live in harmony.

231
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:17,120
CHAPTER SIX
What Do You Think?

232
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,310
HOW WILL OUR LIVES CHANGE IN THE FUTURE BECAUSE
OF ROBOTS?

233
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:27,070
Every year, technological advances mean newer,
faster computers, newer communication devices,

234
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:30,640
and more sophisticated, more capable robots.

235
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:33,569
In Japan, this is viewed with excitement.

236
00:16:33,569 --> 00:16:39,029
Perhaps, due to their philosophical history,
the Japanese are more capable of "understanding"

237
00:16:39,029 --> 00:16:40,720
and working with robots.

238
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:45,889
Do you think robots will become as popular
in other parts of the world?

239
00:16:45,889 --> 00:16:51,209
Will they be as accepted in other countries
or will they be objects of fear?

240
00:16:51,209 --> 00:16:55,600
Robots will probably soon play a more important
role in our lives.

241
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,800
They will be able to move around better and
perform simple jobs around the house, such

242
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:03,569
as painting, cleaning, and other household
tasks.

243
00:17:03,569 --> 00:17:07,670
But will they be able to communicate with
humans, have decision-making abilities, and

244
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:10,950
generally live alongside us on the planet?

245
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:15,490
The robot brain is based on computers and
their increasing ability to carry out billions

246
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:18,320
of instructions very quickly.

247
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:23,310
But will robot brains ever have the same kind
of intelligence as humans do?

248
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:29,320
Will the computer-based artificial brain allow
robots to become like intelligent human beings?

249
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:32,080
Some predictions say "Yes!"

250
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:37,240
Already computers can "understand" humans
to some extent by recognizing our speech.

251
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:40,630
Can you imagine having a robot as a friend?

252
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:45,260
Will children go to school with robot friends
who help them with their homework?

253
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:49,410
How will people behave socially with robots
in the future?

254
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:52,100
Will they be treated as machines?

255
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:55,890
Or will they act so like us that we treat
them as equals?

256
00:17:55,890 --> 00:18:00,390
Will we have to change our laws to include
the fair treatment of robots?

257
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:04,200
We might even have groups fighting for "robot
rights."

258
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:08,200
For example, should robots be paid for the
work they do?

259
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,200
And if so, how?

260
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,730
What do you think will happen?

261
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:15,010
And will it happen in your lifetime?

262
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:15,410
- THE END -
