CHAPTER ONE
Harriet Tubman

2
00:00:01,330 --> 00:00:02,330
c. 1820 - 1913

3
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:13,740
The slave who escaped and helped hundreds
of other slaves to escape

4
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:19,560
I escaped from slavery in the south of the
USA.

5
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:27,859
I then helped hundreds of other slaves to
escape to the north of the USA and Canada.

6
00:00:27,859 --> 00:00:36,489
I also freed hundreds of slaves who wanted
to fight in the Civil War.

7
00:00:36,489 --> 00:00:43,039
My parents were slaves for the Brodess family
in Maryland, USA.

8
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:47,160
I was the fifth of nine children.

9
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:53,690
At the age of 6, I started work as a nursemaid
for another family.

10
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:59,149
After that I had to work in the woods and
fields.

11
00:00:59,149 --> 00:01:03,460
Our owners did not think of us as people.

12
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:07,420
For them, we were like animals or machines.

13
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:17,340
If we did something wrong, they hit us or
punished us in horrible ways.

14
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:26,060
In 1831, at the age of 11, I started to do
the same work as the adult slaves.

15
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:33,100
Every day we had to work for many hours in
the fields.

16
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:38,170
Around this time, I received an injury, which
I never forgot.

17
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:42,540
I refused to stop a slave who was escaping.

18
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:48,710
The slave's owner threw a metal weight at
the slave, but it hit me on the head.

19
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:56,190
It hurt a lot and this injury gave me headaches
for the rest of my life.

20
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:57,190
***

21
00:01:57,190 --> 00:02:00,700
In 1849, I was brave and tried to escape.

22
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:07,640
I was married by then, but my marriage was
very unhappy and I hated the thought of another

23
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,380
year of slavery.

24
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:13,830
Two of my brothers agreed to come with me.

25
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:19,390
We wanted to reach the north of the USA, where
slavery was illegal.

26
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:24,460
I could live there as a free woman.

27
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:31,770
We made good progress towards the north, but
then we heard some bad news.

28
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:37,980
Our owner was offering $300 to anyone who
caught us.

29
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:44,350
My brothers became frightened and we decided
to return to Maryland.

30
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:49,860
We were punished when we returned, but I still
wanted to escape.

31
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:54,860
A short time later, I escaped again.

32
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,900
This time I went alone.

33
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:03,100
I travelled at night along quiet roads and
paths.

34
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:06,450
Some kind people helped me on the way.

35
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:09,850
They gave me food and a place to sleep.

36
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:15,760
Finally, I arrived in the city of Philadelphia
in the north.

37
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:24,420
The journey was long and difficult, but it
felt wonderful to be free at last.

38
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:25,420
***

39
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:29,110
In Philadelphia, I got a job and began to
earn money.

40
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:33,980
I missed my parents and my brothers and sisters.

41
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:39,570
I was free and I wanted my family to be free,
too.

42
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:44,030
Maybe I could help them to escape?

43
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:49,230
In 1850, I received some bad news.

44
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:53,650
My niece and her daughters were in danger.

45
00:03:53,650 --> 00:04:00,090
Their owner wanted to sell them and they didn't
want to go to different families.

46
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:04,090
I decided to return to Maryland to free them.

47
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:07,050
I had to help them to escape.

48
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:14,470
We travelled at night and used the stars to
find our way to the north.

49
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:21,199
After helping my niece and her daughters,
I helped many other slaves to escape.

50
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:28,949
I offered to help my husband, John Tubman,
too, but he didn't want to leave the south.

51
00:04:28,949 --> 00:04:34,599
He didn't want to be with me any more, so
our marriage ended.

52
00:04:34,599 --> 00:04:41,050
Soon, a new law made things a lot more difficult
for me.

53
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:46,620
It became illegal to help a slave to escape
in the USA.

54
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:55,090
I had to find a new route - to Canada, where
slavery was illegal.

55
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:56,090
***

56
00:04:56,090 --> 00:05:01,729
In 1857, I went on a very special journey
to help my parents.

57
00:05:01,729 --> 00:05:08,069
They weren't slaves any more, but their life
in the south was very difficult.

58
00:05:08,069 --> 00:05:13,879
They were very happy to see me again and wanted
to go with me to Canada.

59
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:21,300
Our journey was very slow and difficult because
my parents were old.

60
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:28,639
We had a big celebration when we finally arrived
in Ontario, Canada.

61
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:34,900
In 1861, the American Civil War started.

62
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:39,780
The Confederates from the south wanted slavery
to continue.

63
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:46,310
The Unionists from the north wanted slavery
to become illegal.

64
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:51,430
I joined the Union Army, which fought for
the north.

65
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:57,110
An army captain, James Montgomery, heard about
me.

66
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:02,439
He discovered that I helped slaves to escape
before the war.

67
00:06:02,439 --> 00:06:05,889
And he wanted my help.

68
00:06:05,889 --> 00:06:11,819
He wanted slaves to fight for freedom in the
Union Army.

69
00:06:11,819 --> 00:06:18,770
I took a team of spies to the south and found
slaves who wanted to join us.

70
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:23,849
It was dangerous work, but we were very successful.

71
00:06:23,849 --> 00:06:32,370
On one trip, 700 slaves agreed to escape and
they became soldiers.

72
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:37,900
On 9th April 1865, the war ended.

73
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:41,849
What could I do with my life now?

74
00:06:41,849 --> 00:06:48,970
I decided to fight for equal rights for black
people and for women.

75
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:57,440
I spoke at public meetings and I tried to
help black people who were poor and old.

76
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,440
***

77
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:06,789
In 1896, I bought some land and, in 1903,
I gave the land to my church.

78
00:07:06,789 --> 00:07:15,530
I wanted the church to start a home for black
people who were poor and elderly.

79
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:20,710
In 1908, the home opened for the first time.

80
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:25,629
As I looked back at my life, I was very proud.

81
00:07:25,629 --> 00:07:29,400
I was happy that I helped so many people to
find freedom.

82
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,400
The Life of Harriet Tubman

83
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,400
c.1820 Araminta Harriet Koss was born in Maryland,
USA.

84
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,400
Her parents were slaves for the Brodess family.

85
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,400
1826 She started to work as a nursemaid when
she was 6 years old.

86
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,400
1831 When she was 11 years old, she started
to do the same work as adult slaves.

87
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,400
She was hit by a metal weight.

88
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,400
The head injury gave her pain for the rest
of her life.

89
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,400
1844 She married John Tubman, a free man.

90
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,400
1849 She escaped for the first time with two
of her brothers.

91
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,400
$300 was offered to anyone who caught them.

92
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,400
They decided to return to their owner.

93
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,400
A short time later, Harriet escaped again
and reached Philadelphia in the north of the

94
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,400
USA.

95
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,400
1850 She helped her niece and many other slaves
to escape to Philadelphia.

96
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,400
It became illegal to help a slave to escape
in the USA.

97
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,400
Harriet found a new route to Canada.

98
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,400
1857 She helped her parents to escape to Ontario,
Canada.

99
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,400
1860 She went on her last journey to help
slaves to escape from the south.

100
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,400
1861 Harriet joined the Union Army in the
Civil War.

101
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,400
1863 She worked for Colonel James Montgomery,
a captain in the Union Army.

102
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,400
She found slaves who wanted to join the Union
Army.

103
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,400
1865 She wrote a book Scenes in the Life of
Harriet Tubman with Sarah H. Bradford.

104
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,400
1869 She married Nelson Davis who was a soldier
in the Civil War.

105
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,400
1899 She started to receive money for her
work during the war.

106
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,400
1903 She bought some land to build a home
for black people who were poor and old.

107
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,400
1908 The Harriet Tubman Home for the Aged
opened for the first time.

108
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,400
1913 Harriet died when she was 93 years old.

109
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,400
She spent her final years in the home that
she helped to build.

110
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,400
CHAPTER TWO
Emmeline Pankhurst

111
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,400
1858-1928

112
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,400
The woman who wanted women to be able to vote

113
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,400
I campaigned all my life for equal rights
for women.

114
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,400
I started a political group which fought for
the vote for women in Britain.

115
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:07,550
After many years of protests, we finally won
the right for British women to vote.

116
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:15,479
When I was born in 1858, women in Britain
didn't have the same rights as men.

117
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:19,449
Most women couldn't go to school or university.

118
00:08:19,449 --> 00:08:22,979
They were only allowed to work in certain
jobs.

119
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:27,620
And they didn't have the right to vote.

120
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:35,350
I grew up in Manchester in the north of England
and I saw many problems every day.

121
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:41,160
Mothers had to bring up children in small,
dirty houses.

122
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:46,210
Disease was everywhere because of the terrible
conditions.

123
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:50,560
And most women only lived until they were
around 50 years old.

124
00:08:50,560 --> 00:09:02,380
I knew from a young age that I wanted to improve
women's lives.

125
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:06,150
My parents believed in human rights.

126
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:12,590
They believed that education was a right for
women as well as men.

127
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:18,020
In 1873, my parents sent me to school in Paris.

128
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:22,650
They wanted me to get a wider view of the
world.

129
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:23,650
***

130
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:29,910
In Paris, I was disappointed to discover that
women were still not equal with men after

131
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:32,910
the French Revolution.

132
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:41,720
Action was needed and I returned to England
to begin the fight.

133
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:46,950
In Britain, the political situation was quite
unusual.

134
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:51,010
Our ruler was a woman, Queen Victoria.

135
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:57,140
She was a powerful leader, but she wasn't
interested in women's rights.

136
00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:04,820
Our politicians were all men and they definitely
weren't interested in political equality for

137
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,320
women.

138
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:13,520
In 1879, I was surprised to discover a man
who was campaigning for women's rights.

139
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:19,370
His name was Richard Pankhurst and he was
a lawyer.

140
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:23,520
We shared many of the same beliefs and ideas.

141
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:30,120
We got married and started a family.

142
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,120
***

143
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:36,370
For almost 20 years, Richard and I fought
for political rights for women.

144
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:41,830
Then, sadly, my dear husband died.

145
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:48,280
My daughters and I were very sad, but we decided
to continue our campaign.

146
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:56,870
The two oldest daughters, Christabel and Sylvia,
became activists.

147
00:10:56,870 --> 00:11:06,030
In 1903, we started the Women's Social and
Political Union (WSPU).

148
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:10,690
It was a group that fought for the right for
women to vote.

149
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:14,500
Christabel became one of our bravest leaders.

150
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:22,870
Sylvia was an artist and she designed our
posters and signs.

151
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:30,030
The WSPU organized many public meetings and
protests.

152
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:33,480
Sometimes the police arrested our members.

153
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:38,570
Christabel was one of the first to go to prison.

154
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:42,810
When our members were in prison, we protested.

155
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:48,130
And when our members came out of prison, we
celebrated in the streets.

156
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:54,250
It was very important to get public attention.

157
00:11:54,250 --> 00:12:00,310
Unfortunately, the government didn't agree
with our campaign.

158
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:04,360
We had to take more powerful action.

159
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,320
Some of our members began to break the law.

160
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:12,570
They lit fires in buildings and broke windows.

161
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:16,300
Our campaign was a war for these women.

162
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:23,190
For me, it was always a fight for equal rights.

163
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:26,450
Every time I was arrested, I told the judge.

164
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:33,180
'We don't want to break laws, we want to make
new laws.'

165
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:39,170
But the lawyers and politicians didn't want
to listen.

166
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:46,420
In 1910, Prime Minister Asquith, the government
leader, stopped a new law that gave women

167
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:47,420
the vote.

168
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:51,030
We were shocked and angry.

169
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:59,250
On Friday, 18th November, I led a group of
women to meet the Prime Minister, but he refused

170
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,980
to see us.

171
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:07,500
We started to protest in the street and 100
women were arrested.

172
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,070
It was a terrible day.

173
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:16,400
We called it 'Black Friday'.

174
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,400
***

175
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:26,470
In 1914 the First World War began and we agreed
to stop our campaign.

176
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:33,160
Women were now needed as nurses in hospitals
and to work in factories and on farms.

177
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:42,320
In 1917, we started a new group with a new
name, The Women's Party.

178
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,890
In 1918, the First World War ended.

179
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:53,620
The government realized that women were an
important part of the victory in the war.

180
00:13:53,620 --> 00:14:02,230
At last, women were given the right to vote
- but only women over 30 years old who owned

181
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:04,840
a home could vote.

182
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:08,010
Any man over 21 could vote.

183
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:13,880
We still didn't have full equality!

184
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:21,090
After the war, I went to live in the USA,
Canada and also Bermuda.

185
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:25,820
In 1926, I returned to England.

186
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:32,090
I wanted to become a politician, but my health
wasn't good enough.

187
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:41,970
In 1928, only three weeks before I died, a
new law gave women the same right to vote

188
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:45,750
as men.

189
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:48,350
It took much longer than we hoped.

190
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:57,410
But in the end our campaign was successful
and at last we won political equality for

191
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:58,410
women.

192
00:14:58,410 --> 00:14:59,410
The Life of Emmeline Pankhurst

193
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:00,410
1858 Emmeline Goulden was born in Manchester,
England.

194
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:01,410
1860s She became interested in women's rights
as a child and went to political meetings.

195
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:02,410
1873 She was sent to a school in Paris, which
believed in equal education for boys and girls.

196
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:03,410
1879 She met and married Richard Pankhurst,
a lawyer.

197
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:04,410
He believed in votes for women.

198
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:05,410
1886 The family moved to London.

199
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:06,410
They had meetings for political activists
in their home.

200
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:07,410
1893 Richard and Emmeline returned to Manchester.

201
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:08,410
1898 Richard died, but Emmeline decided to
continue the campaign to win the vote for

202
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:09,410
women.

203
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:10,410
1903 Emmeline and her daughters, Christabel
and Sylvia, started the Women's Social and

204
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:11,410
Political Union (WSPU), which fought for political
equality for women.

205
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,410
1905 Christabel was arrested during a protest.

206
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:13,410
1908 Emmeline was arrested for the first time.

207
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:14,410
She went to prison for six weeks.

208
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:15,410
1910 Prime Minister Asquith stopped a law
that gave women the vote.

209
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:16,410
The WSPU protested and 100 women were arrested.

210
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:17,410
1914 The First World War started.

211
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:18,410
The WSPU stopped their campaign for the vote.

212
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:19,410
1916 Emmeline visited the USA, Canada and
Russia.

213
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:20,410
She wanted women there to fight for the vote
in their countries.

214
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:21,410
1917 Christabel and Emmeline started The Women's
Party.

215
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:22,410
1918 The First World War ended.

216
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:23,410
Women over 30 years old won the right to vote.

217
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:24,410
After the war, Emmeline went to live in the
USA, Canada and Bermuda.

218
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:25,410
1926 She returned to England and wanted to
become a politician.

219
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:26,410
She became ill and could not continue with
her plans.

220
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:27,410
1928 Emmeline died in London a few weeks after
a new law gave equal voting rights to women.

221
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:28,410
She was 69 years old.

222
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:29,410
CHAPTER THREE
Maria Montessori

223
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:30,410
1870 - 1952

224
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:31,410
The doctor who discovered a new way to teach
children

225
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:32,410
I was the first woman to get a medical degree
in Italy.

226
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:33,410
I helped children with mental problems to
learn.

227
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:34,410
I then created a special method to teach all
children.

228
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:37,960
Many schools around the world still use my
method.

229
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:45,900
When I was a little girl, my mother always
told me, 'Be kind to others.'

230
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:51,380
Every day, she asked me to make clothes for
poor people.

231
00:15:51,380 --> 00:16:00,290
We lived in Chiaravalle in Italy and a lot
of poor families lived near our home.

232
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:06,380
Fortunately, my parents had enough money to
send me to school.

233
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:10,470
My father had traditional ideas about women.

234
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:13,800
He wanted me to get married and stay at home.

235
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:19,360
So he didn't want me to continue my education
after primary school.

236
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:28,760
But my mother was very different and she encouraged
me to study.

237
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:36,990
In 1883, I started at secondary school and
after that I went to a technical college.

238
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:45,510
I did well in maths and physics, but later
I became very interested in biology.

239
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:49,210
I decided to become a doctor.

240
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:52,290
It wasn't an easy decision to make.

241
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:56,640
Only men studied for medical degrees at that
time.

242
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:00,900
Would a medical school accept me?

243
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:01,900
***

244
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:08,309
In 1890, I began a course in science at the
University of Rome.

245
00:17:08,309 --> 00:17:17,240
I did very well in this degree and at last
the university's medical school accepted me.

246
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:21,970
Some of the teachers and students didn't want
me to study there.

247
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:34,639
But I worked hard and in 1896, I was the first
woman in Italy to become a doctor.

248
00:17:34,639 --> 00:17:41,190
The university had a special hospital for
children with mental problems.

249
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:45,749
I wanted to help the children to communicate
and to learn.

250
00:17:45,749 --> 00:17:50,259
I wanted to improve their lives.

251
00:17:50,259 --> 00:17:52,879
But how could I do this?

252
00:17:52,879 --> 00:18:00,690
I began to study and give talks about this
question.

253
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:09,440
In 1898, I became a director of a school in
Rome for children with mental problems.

254
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:18,169
At that time, people called these children
horrible things, such as 'crazy' or 'idiots'.

255
00:18:18,169 --> 00:18:21,090
But these children were just different.

256
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:25,419
And they needed to learn in a different way.

257
00:18:25,419 --> 00:18:30,360
My teachers and I showed the children what
to do.

258
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:36,360
Slowly, we made progress with this practical
method.

259
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:44,419
We showed the children simple actions, such
as how to eat or wash or play games.

260
00:18:44,419 --> 00:18:52,980
The children copied these actions and then
we repeated them again and again.

261
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:53,980
***

262
00:18:53,980 --> 00:19:00,139
In 1906, the government asked me to work in
a different school for very young children

263
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,929
from poor families.

264
00:19:02,929 --> 00:19:09,210
I changed the classrooms and took away the
rows of desks.

265
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:15,130
We used small tables and encouraged the children
to play.

266
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:21,600
We created educational toys that the children
could touch and feel.

267
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:26,510
They learned by playing.

268
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:29,649
Traditional teachers didn't understand this
method.

269
00:19:29,649 --> 00:19:33,860
For them, the most important thing was to
teach.

270
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:40,590
For us, the most important thing was to learn.

271
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:50,669
We also wanted children to help each other
and to learn from their own experiences.

272
00:19:50,669 --> 00:19:51,669
***

273
00:19:51,669 --> 00:19:56,019
Soon people in other countries wanted to know
about my teaching method.

274
00:19:56,019 --> 00:19:59,970
Montessori schools were opened in many countries.

275
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:08,059
By 1913, there were more than 100 Montessori
schools in the USA.

276
00:20:08,059 --> 00:20:14,749
Alexander Graham Bell, the inventor of the
telephone, believed in my method and became

277
00:20:14,749 --> 00:20:21,620
the leader of the American Montessori Society.

278
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:30,440
In 1915, I was invited to the USA and spoke
at Carnegie Hall, a famous concert hall in

279
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,270
New York.

280
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:36,929
In San Francisco, I gave a course for teachers.

281
00:20:36,929 --> 00:20:42,049
We made a classroom with 21 students and a
glass wall.

282
00:20:42,049 --> 00:20:49,009
Thousands of people came to watch our classes.

283
00:20:49,009 --> 00:20:50,009
***

284
00:20:50,009 --> 00:20:57,370
In Europe, the First World War was destroying
many lives.

285
00:20:57,370 --> 00:21:05,009
I decided to move to Barcelona in Spain where
things were more peaceful than in Italy.

286
00:21:05,009 --> 00:21:10,980
I lived there for many years and travelled
to many other countries to teach people about

287
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:15,379
my method.

288
00:21:15,379 --> 00:21:25,350
In 1929, an international organization was
started, the International Montessori Association.

289
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:34,160
The organization encouraged parents and teachers
to use the Montessori method.

290
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:43,120
In 1936, the Spanish Civil War started and
I decided to move to Amsterdam, in the Netherlands.

291
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:50,730
There were more than 200 Montessori schools
in the Netherlands at that time.

292
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:57,210
I continued to create new educational materials
and give talks.

293
00:21:57,210 --> 00:22:03,840
I wanted people to use education for peace.

294
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:12,110
In 1939, I was invited to India to give talks
and train teachers.

295
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:22,539
The Second World War started that year and
in 1940 the German army attacked the Netherlands.

296
00:22:22,539 --> 00:22:30,600
I couldn't go home to Amsterdam, so I stayed
in India for several years and created courses

297
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:34,830
for Indian teachers.

298
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:35,830
***

299
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:42,009
For the rest of my life, I continued to train
teachers and improve my method.

300
00:22:42,009 --> 00:22:48,480
I was given many honours for my work, such
as the French Legion of Honour.

301
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:55,580
I was also nominated three times for the Nobel
Peace Prize because I believed in education

302
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:59,320
for peace.

303
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:05,630
I believed that education could improve people's
lives.

304
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:12,259
When I looked back at my long life, I was
happy that my Montessori schools were able

305
00:23:12,259 --> 00:23:13,259
to do this.

306
00:23:13,259 --> 00:23:14,259
The Life of Maria Montessori

307
00:23:14,259 --> 00:23:15,259
1870 Maria Montessori was born in Chiaravalle,
Italy.

308
00:23:15,259 --> 00:23:16,259
1876 She started primary school in Rome.

309
00:23:16,259 --> 00:23:17,259
1883 Maria started secondary school.

310
00:23:17,259 --> 00:23:18,259
1886 She went to a technical college and did
well in maths and science.

311
00:23:18,259 --> 00:23:19,259
1890 - 1892 She studied science at the University
of Rome and got her first degree in 1892.

312
00:23:19,259 --> 00:23:20,259
1893 She was accepted by the medical school
of the University of Rome.

313
00:23:20,259 --> 00:23:21,259
1896 She became the first woman in Italy to
become a doctor.

314
00:23:21,259 --> 00:23:22,259
1896 - 1901 Maria studied children with mental
problems in Rome University Hospital.

315
00:23:22,259 --> 00:23:23,259
In 1898, she became a director of a school
in Rome for children with serious mental problems.

316
00:23:23,259 --> 00:23:24,259
1906 Maria was asked by the government to
work in a school for young children from poor

317
00:23:24,259 --> 00:23:25,259
families.

318
00:23:25,259 --> 00:23:26,259
In 1907, the first Casa dei Bambini (Children's
House) was opened.

319
00:23:26,259 --> 00:23:27,259
Maria started to train teachers in her method.

320
00:23:27,259 --> 00:23:28,259
1909 - 1915 Montessori schools opened around
the world.

321
00:23:28,259 --> 00:23:29,259
Maria wrote many books during this time, such
as The Montessori Method (1909).

322
00:23:29,259 --> 00:23:30,259
1915 She was invited to give talks and train
teachers in the USA.

323
00:23:30,259 --> 00:23:31,259
1915 - 1936 Maria lived in Barcelona, Spain.

324
00:23:31,259 --> 00:23:32,259
She trained teachers and gave many talks about
the Montessori Method.

325
00:23:32,259 --> 00:23:33,259
In 1929 the International Montessori Association
was started.

326
00:23:33,259 --> 00:23:34,259
1936 When the Spanish Civil War started, she
moved to Amsterdam in the Netherlands.

327
00:23:34,259 --> 00:23:35,259
1939 She went to India to give talks and train
teachers.

328
00:23:35,259 --> 00:23:36,259
1940 The Germans attacked the Netherlands
in the Second World War.

329
00:23:36,259 --> 00:23:37,259
Maria had to stay in India until the war ended.

330
00:23:37,259 --> 00:23:38,259
1946 She returned to the Netherlands and continued
her work.

331
00:23:38,259 --> 00:23:39,259
1947 - 1949 She wrote many more new books,
such as Peace and Education (1949).

332
00:23:39,259 --> 00:23:40,259
1949 - 1951 She continued to train teachers
and improve her method.

333
00:23:40,259 --> 00:23:41,259
She won many honours, such as the French Legion
of Honour.

334
00:23:41,259 --> 00:23:42,259
1952 She died when she was 81 years old in
the Netherlands.

335
00:23:42,259 --> 00:23:43,259
CHAPTER FOUR
Helen Keller

336
00:23:43,259 --> 00:23:44,259
1880 - 1968

337
00:23:44,259 --> 00:23:45,259
The deaf and blind woman who became a famous
teacher

338
00:23:45,259 --> 00:23:46,259
I became blind and deaf before I learned to
speak.

339
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:47,259
With the help of several special people, I
learned to communicate.

340
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:48,980
I used my communication skills to teach people
about blindness.

341
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:55,159
I also fought for the rights of women and
workers.

342
00:23:55,159 --> 00:24:01,009
I was born in 1880, in Alabama, in the USA.

343
00:24:01,009 --> 00:24:09,470
When I was 19 months old, I became very sick
with meningitis, a disease of the brain.

344
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:17,960
I got better after the illness, but unfortunately
I couldn't see or hear any more.

345
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:24,190
I found it very difficult to learn and I became
very angry.

346
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:29,899
I was able to think, but I could not communicate
my thoughts.

347
00:24:29,899 --> 00:24:36,110
It was a very difficult time for me and for
my parents.

348
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:43,989
My mother and father wanted to help me but
they didn't know what to do.

349
00:24:43,989 --> 00:24:51,710
Fortunately, I began to communicate with Martha
Washington, who was 6 years old and the daughter

350
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:54,559
of our cook.

351
00:24:54,559 --> 00:25:00,070
We created our own sign language when we played
together.

352
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:10,220
I enjoyed learning from Martha, but my mother
realized that I needed professional help.

353
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:19,220
In 1886, my mother learned about the work
of Alexander Graham Bell, the inventor of

354
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:21,870
the telephone.

355
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:26,100
He was working on the problems of the deaf.

356
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:30,029
Maybe he could help?

357
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:36,860
Bell told my mother about Perkins School for
blind people and the school sent a special

358
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:38,999
teacher to our home.

359
00:25:38,999 --> 00:25:42,109
Her name was Anne Sullivan.

360
00:25:42,109 --> 00:25:43,109
***

361
00:25:43,109 --> 00:25:51,929
At first, I was a very difficult student,
but Anne Sullivan was very kind to me.

362
00:25:51,929 --> 00:26:01,279
One day, we were getting water from the well
when Anne drew some signs on my hand.

363
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:06,960
I realized that she was writing the word 'water'.

364
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,090
I was so excited!

365
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:16,899
Within a few hours, I could 'read' more than
30 different words.

366
00:26:16,899 --> 00:26:23,590
At last, I could communicate with other people
and they could communicate with me.

367
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:30,339
Anne helped me to escape from my lonely world.

368
00:26:30,339 --> 00:26:31,339
***

369
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:36,369
When I was 8 years old, I went with Anne to
the Perkins School for blind people.

370
00:26:36,369 --> 00:26:45,379
At the school, I was excited to discover that
there were other children like me.

371
00:26:45,379 --> 00:26:50,360
We all learned from our teachers and from
each other.

372
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:58,950
I learned to read Braille in English and later
in several other languages.

373
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:06,960
In 1894, Anne took me to New York and I studied
at several different schools for the blind

374
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,659
and deaf.

375
00:27:09,659 --> 00:27:14,679
I tried to learn to speak but it was difficult.

376
00:27:14,679 --> 00:27:20,480
My voice worked, but I didn't know how to
use it properly.

377
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:26,909
Only Anne and a few other people could understand
me when I spoke.

378
00:27:26,909 --> 00:27:27,909
***

379
00:27:27,909 --> 00:27:32,960
I studied hard and, in 1900, I started at
university.

380
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:37,700
Anne went with me to every class.

381
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:41,519
She wrote the teachers' words on my hand.

382
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:48,179
In 1904, I became the first deaf and blind
person to get a degree.

383
00:27:48,179 --> 00:27:50,889
I was so happy and proud.

384
00:27:50,889 --> 00:27:57,299
And I knew that I wanted to use my communication
skills to help other people.

385
00:27:57,299 --> 00:28:04,070
At first, I worked with organizations that
fought for women's rights.

386
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:11,960
Then, in 1912, I started to work with workers'
organizations.

387
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:17,530
I discovered that some types of work made
people blind.

388
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:25,200
I wanted people to know about this problem,
so I wrote a book in Braille about it.

389
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:33,989
In 1915, I started my own organization, Helen
Keller International, which still teaches

390
00:28:33,989 --> 00:28:37,470
people about blindness.

391
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:45,799
I wanted everyone to know that in many cases,
blindness can be prevented.

392
00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:46,799
***

393
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:53,520
For many years, I travelled around the world
and talked to groups of people about blindness.

394
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,730
I communicated with Anne.

395
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:59,149
She then spoke my words for me.

396
00:28:59,149 --> 00:29:07,580
Our talks became very popular and sometimes
we earned up to $2,000 a week.

397
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:13,909
We gave the money to organizations that helped
blind people.

398
00:29:13,909 --> 00:29:19,640
When Anne became ill, Polly Thomson became
my guide.

399
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:27,320
Unfortunately, in 1936, Anne died.

400
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:33,919
She did so much for me and I never forgot
her.

401
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:34,919
***

402
00:29:34,919 --> 00:29:41,440
With the help of several special people, I
wrote 12 books about my beliefs.

403
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:46,669
I became famous because of the talks and the
books.

404
00:29:46,669 --> 00:29:49,379
Important people wanted to meet me.

405
00:29:49,379 --> 00:29:56,409
I even met the King of England and the President
of the USA.

406
00:29:56,409 --> 00:30:04,549
Polly Thomson helped me with my work until
she became very ill in 1957.

407
00:30:04,549 --> 00:30:10,960
After that, Winnie Corbally became my guide
and travelled with me to teach people about

408
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,740
blindness.

409
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:22,100
Our work was helped by a theatre play, The
Miracle Worker about the life of Anne Sullivan.

410
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:29,359
In 1962, it became a popular film.

411
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:38,179
In 1964, I won an important award from the
President of the USA for my work.

412
00:30:38,179 --> 00:30:44,570
The year after that, my name was added to
the list of the most successful women in the

413
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:49,820
USA - the Women's Hall of Fame.

414
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:59,190
The names of my guides - Anne, Polly and Winnie
- should be in that list too.

415
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:08,240
In 1968, at the end of my life, I remembered
Anne, Polly and Winnie.

416
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:12,550
I felt proud of our work, which helped blind
people around the world.

417
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:13,550
The Life of Helen Keller

418
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:14,550
1880 Helen Adams Keller was born in Tuscumbia,
Alabama, USA.

419
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:15,550
1881 Helen became ill with meningitis (a disease
of the brain) when she was 19 months old.

420
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:16,550
She became deaf and blind because of the disease.

421
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:17,550
1882 She started playing with Martha Washington,
a 6-year old girl.

422
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:18,550
They created over 60 signs to communicate
with each other.

423
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:19,550
1886 Helen's mother asked Alexander Graham
Bell, the inventor of the telephone, for help.

424
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:20,550
He told her about the Perkins School for blind
children.

425
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:21,550
The school sent Anne Sullivan to teach Helen.

426
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:22,550
Anne taught Helen to communicate with other
people.

427
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:23,550
Anne stayed with Helen and helped her for
49 years.

428
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:24,550
1888 Helen went to the Perkins School for
blind children in Watertown, Massachusetts.

429
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:25,550
Anne helped her to read and write in Braille.

430
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,550
1894 Helen moved to New York where she studied
at several different schools for the blind

431
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:27,550
and deaf.

432
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:28,550
1900 Helen started university at Radcliffe
College in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

433
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:29,550
1904 She became the first deaf and blind person
to get a degree.

434
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:30,550
1915 She started Helen Keller International,
an organization to teach people about blindness.

435
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:31,550
1924 She started to travel around the world
and give talks about blindness.

436
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:32,550
1936 Anne Sullivan died.

437
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:33,550
Polly Thomson became her new guide.

438
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:34,550
They travelled around the world and talked
to groups about blindness.

439
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:35,550
1960 Polly Thomson died and Winnie Corbally
became her guide.

440
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:36,550
1962 The Miracle Worker, a play about the
life of Anne Sullivan, became a popular film.

441
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:37,550
1964 Helen received an award for her work
from the President of the USA.

442
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:38,550
1965 Her name was added to the list of the
most successful women in the USA - the Women's

443
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:39,550
Hall of Fame.

444
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:40,550
1968 Helen Keller died at her home in Easton,
Connecticut, USA.

445
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:41,550
She was 88 years old.

446
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:42,550
CHAPTER FIVE
Eva Peron

447
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:43,550
c. 1919 - 1952

448
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:44,550
The actress who helped poor and sick people
in Argentina

449
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:45,550
I was a famous actress in Argentina.

450
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:46,550
I helped my husband, Juan Peron, to become
President.

451
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:47,550
I used my power to help sick and poor people.

452
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:54,409
I also helped women to get the vote for the
first time in Argentina.

453
00:31:54,409 --> 00:32:01,940
I was born in 1919 in Los Toldos in the Argentinian
countryside.

454
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:08,910
My mother was a poor country girl, but my
father was a rich man from the city.

455
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:18,450
Unfortunately, my father died when I was very
young and life was very hard for my family.

456
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:21,429
My mother worked hard to earn money.

457
00:32:21,429 --> 00:32:23,730
She made clothes for other people.

458
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:31,519
Four years after my father died, in 1930,
we moved to a small apartment in the city

459
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:33,509
of Junin.

460
00:32:33,509 --> 00:32:39,539
Life was very difficult at first, but my brothers
and sisters were growing up.

461
00:32:39,539 --> 00:32:41,679
Soon they got jobs.

462
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:47,700
With their money, we moved to a larger home
and I was able to start school.

463
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:56,659
I enjoyed school very much, but my favourite
lessons were singing and acting.

464
00:32:56,659 --> 00:33:04,440
In 1933, I won a role in the school play - I
was so excited!

465
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:09,149
From that day, I knew that I wanted to be
an actress.

466
00:33:09,149 --> 00:33:13,059
It was my dream.

467
00:33:13,059 --> 00:33:14,059
***

468
00:33:14,059 --> 00:33:21,460
In 1935, when I was 15 years old, my mother
found me a place to live in Buenos Aires.

469
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:28,109
It was exciting for me to be in this amazing
city, but it was a time of great economic

470
00:33:28,109 --> 00:33:29,489
problems.

471
00:33:29,489 --> 00:33:35,879
Many people didn't have work and everywhere
I went, I saw poor and hungry people in the

472
00:33:35,879 --> 00:33:39,009
streets.

473
00:33:39,009 --> 00:33:43,940
Luckily I found a job so I had enough money
to pay my rent.

474
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:50,820
During the day I worked and, in the evenings,
I joined a theatre group.

475
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:58,380
Soon I was given my first role at the Comedias
Theatre and, in 1936, I travelled with the

476
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:01,669
theatre company around Argentina.

477
00:34:01,669 --> 00:34:05,330
I also got my first part in a film.

478
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:12,679
I was only 17 years old and I was already
an actress!

479
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:13,679

480
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:20,129
In 1937, I started working for Radio El Mundo
on a popular radio show.

481
00:34:20,129 --> 00:34:29,879
Radio El Mundo was the biggest radio company
in Argentina and soon my name was well known.

482
00:34:29,879 --> 00:34:38,210
Then Radio Belgrano asked me to work for them
on their show, Great Women of History.

483
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:45,589
On the show, I played some famous roles - Queen
Elizabeth the First of England was one of

484
00:34:45,589 --> 00:34:48,149
them.

485
00:34:48,149 --> 00:34:53,639
I was no longer a poor girl from the countryside.

486
00:34:53,639 --> 00:35:01,530
Important people wanted to meet me and, by
1942, I had my own apartment in one of the

487
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:04,040
best parts of the city.

488
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:09,000
But then something happened that changed my
life forever.

489
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:14,980
In January 1944, an earthquake hit the town
of San Juan.

490
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:21,550
It was terrible because 10,000 people were
killed and many more were hurt.

491
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:24,700
Juan Peron was an important political leader.

492
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:32,960
He organized a concert to help the people
of San Juan and I was invited to be in it.

493
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:39,510
After the concert, I talked to Juan Peron
and learned about his political ideas.

494
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:49,420
From that day, I had a new dream - I wanted
Juan Peron to become the President of Argentina.

495
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:50,420
***

496
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:55,530
On the radio, I talked every day about Juan's
work and his ideas.

497
00:35:55,530 --> 00:36:03,030
Unfortunately, Juan had powerful enemies and
they found him and put him in prison.

498
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:13,059
On my radio show, I asked the people for help
and, on 15th October 1945, 300000 people came

499
00:36:13,059 --> 00:36:17,760
to the Casa Rosada (the President's house)
in Buenos Aires.

500
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:24,150
I stood on a balcony of the house and spoke
to the people from my heart.

501
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:28,890
Soon everyone was shouting, 'Free Juan Peron!

502
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:35,740
Free Juan Peron!'

503
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:38,839
Two days later, Juan was free.

504
00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:45,260
And the following day, Juan and I got married
- we were so happy!

505
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:52,220
We travelled together around Argentina and
we both spoke at political meetings.

506
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:56,950
I told the people that Juan could help them
and their families.

507
00:36:56,950 --> 00:37:02,020
I also asked them to call me Evita (little
Eva).

508
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:10,770
We were a great success and, in 1946, Juan
Peron became the President of Argentina.

509
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:11,770
***

510
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:21,190
Suddenly, at the age of 27, I was the President's
wife and the 'First Lady' of Argentina.

511
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:24,450
I wanted to work hard and help the people.

512
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:30,700
In 1947, Evita City was built to give homes
to poor families.

513
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:43,450
And, in 1948, I started the Eva Peron Foundation,
an organization to help poor and sick people.

514
00:37:43,450 --> 00:37:53,780
By 1950, the Foundation had received over
$200 million and had 14,000 workers.

515
00:37:53,780 --> 00:38:01,510
We also gave out thousands of shoes and cooking
materials and built hospitals and schools.

516
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:09,180
I worked day and night and met with thousands
of sick and poor people.

517
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:13,049
I wanted to give them hope.

518
00:38:13,049 --> 00:38:17,740
I also wanted women to have more political
power.

519
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:23,020
When Juan became President, women weren't
able to vote.

520
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:31,020
Juan and I fought to change this and I also
started a new political party for women.

521
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:34,480
It was called the Female Peronist Party.

522
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:42,119
By 1951, the party had more than 500,000 women
members.

523
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:50,310
With the help of these women, Juan Peron became
President for the second time.

524
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:51,310
***

525
00:38:51,310 --> 00:38:56,680
Many people wanted me to have a bigger political
role, but I had to say no.

526
00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:03,270
I was already working too hard, sometimes
more than 20 hours a day.

527
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:08,079
And the problems I saw every day were making
me ill.

528
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:15,859
My husband asked me to take more rest, but
the poor and sick people needed my help.

529
00:39:15,859 --> 00:39:19,619
I couldn't stop.

530
00:39:19,619 --> 00:39:25,369
I was taken to hospital several times and
lost a lot of weight.

531
00:39:25,369 --> 00:39:31,270
I was also in a lot of pain and the pain got
worse and worse.

532
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:36,260
I wanted to help my husband, but it wasn't
possible.

533
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:45,220
I wanted to see our country become a better
place, but unfortunately this didn't happen.

534
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:54,710
I was only 33 years old when I died, but people
around the world still remember me.

535
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:58,143
And many people in Argentina still think of
me as their Evita.

536
00:39:58,143 --> 00:39:59,143
The Life of Eva Peron

537
00:39:59,143 --> 00:40:00,143
1919 Eva Maria Duarte was born in Los Toldos,
Argentina.

538
00:40:00,143 --> 00:40:01,143
1926 Her father, Juan Duarte, died in a car
accident.

539
00:40:01,143 --> 00:40:02,143
1930 Eva moved with her family to Junin, Argentina.

540
00:40:02,143 --> 00:40:03,143
1933 She was given her first role in a school
play and decided to become an actress.

541
00:40:03,143 --> 00:40:04,143
1935 She moved to Buenos Aires and won a role
with the Comedias Theatre company.

542
00:40:04,143 --> 00:40:05,143
1936 She travelled around Argentina with the
Comedias Theatre company.

543
00:40:05,143 --> 00:40:06,143
She also got a part in her first film.

544
00:40:06,143 --> 00:40:07,143
1937 Eva began working as a radio actress
with Radio El Mundo.

545
00:40:07,143 --> 00:40:08,143
Later that year she started working for Radio
Belgrano on their show, Great Women of History.

546
00:40:08,143 --> 00:40:09,143
1942 She bought her own apartment in Recoleta,
one of the richest areas of Buenos Aires.

547
00:40:09,143 --> 00:40:10,143
1944 10,000 people were killed in an earthquake
in San Juan.

548
00:40:10,143 --> 00:40:11,143
Eva was invited to be in a concert to help
the people of San Juan.

549
00:40:11,143 --> 00:40:12,143
After the concert, she met Juan Peron for
the first time.

550
00:40:12,143 --> 00:40:13,143
1945 Eva talked about Juan Peron's political
ideas on her radio show.

551
00:40:13,143 --> 00:40:14,143
On 9th October, Juan's enemies put him in
prison.

552
00:40:14,143 --> 00:40:15,143
Eva spoke to 300000 people from the balcony
of the Casa Rosada.

553
00:40:15,143 --> 00:40:16,143
Two days later Juan was free.

554
00:40:16,143 --> 00:40:17,143
A day later, Juan and Eva were married.

555
00:40:17,143 --> 00:40:18,143
1946 Juan became the President of Argentina.

556
00:40:18,143 --> 00:40:19,143
1947 Evita City was built to give homes to
poor families.

557
00:40:19,143 --> 00:40:20,143
Women won the right to vote for the first
time in Argentina.

558
00:40:20,143 --> 00:40:21,143
1948 Eva started the Eva Peron Foundation,
an organization to help poor people.

559
00:40:21,143 --> 00:40:22,143
1951 Juan Peron became President of Argentina
for the second time.

560
00:40:22,143 --> 00:40:23,143
The Female Peronist Party had more than 500,000
members by this time.

561
00:40:23,143 --> 00:40:24,143
They helped Juan to become President again.

562
00:40:24,143 --> 00:40:25,143
1952 Eva Peron became very sick and died.

563
00:40:25,143 --> 00:40:26,143
She was 33 years old.

564
00:40:26,143 --> 00:40:27,143
CHAPTER SIX
Nancy Wake

565
00:40:27,143 --> 00:40:28,143
c. 1912 - 2011

566
00:40:28,143 --> 00:40:29,143
The woman who became a spy in the Second World
War

567
00:40:29,143 --> 00:40:30,143
I fought with the French Resistance against
the Germans in the Second World War.

568
00:40:30,143 --> 00:40:31,143
I got weapons for the Resistance fighters
and helped fighters to escape.

569
00:40:31,143 --> 00:40:38,829
I was part of the final victory against the
Germans in 1945.

570
00:40:38,829 --> 00:40:44,170
I was born in New Zealand, but I grew up in
Sydney, Australia.

571
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:53,319
When I was 16 years old, I left home and got
a job as a nurse in the Australian countryside.

572
00:40:53,319 --> 00:41:02,190
In 1932, I received a surprise - 200 pounds
from my aunt.

573
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:07,760
It was a lot of money at that time and I decided
to spend it.

574
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:14,010
I went to Sydney Harbour and bought a ticket
to North America.

575
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:24,930
I enjoyed the journey on the ship and then
travelled around the USA and Canada.

576
00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:30,130
When I wasn't travelling, I worked as a waitress
to earn some money.

577
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:35,349
After a while, I moved to Britain.

578
00:41:35,349 --> 00:41:43,960
I wanted to work on a newspaper, so I studied
to become a newspaper reporter.

579
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:50,940
I got my first job on a newspaper in Paris,
where I learned to speak French.

580
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:57,480
I went to Germany and Austria for the newspaper.

581
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:04,540
I saw the terrible things that Adolf Hitler
and his Nazi party were doing in their country.

582
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:09,089
I realized then that the Nazis were very dangerous.

583
00:42:09,089 --> 00:42:13,680
And they wanted to rule the whole of Europe.

584
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:14,680
***

585
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:22,660
In 1940, the Germans attacked France and occupied
most of the country.

586
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:30,049
I was already living in the south of France,
where I married my first husband, a businessman,

587
00:42:30,049 --> 00:42:31,900
Henri Fiocca.

588
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:37,680
We both hated the Nazis and wanted to help
in the war against them.

589
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:42,170
I began to work for the French Resistance
in Marseille.

590
00:42:42,170 --> 00:42:51,680
I delivered secret messages to the Resistance
fighters and I also helped fighters to escape.

591
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:54,650
The Germans tried to catch me.

592
00:42:54,650 --> 00:43:02,230
I used false papers and changed my appearance
so they didn't recognize me.

593
00:43:02,230 --> 00:43:09,349
In 1943, the Germans caught me, but luckily
I escaped.

594
00:43:09,349 --> 00:43:12,700
It was too dangerous for me to stay in France.

595
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:20,730
I had to leave my husband and go over the
Pyrenees mountains to Spain.

596
00:43:20,730 --> 00:43:27,630
From Spain, I escaped to London and joined
the British army.

597
00:43:27,630 --> 00:43:32,980
I was a little surprised when the British
wanted me to become a spy.

598
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:40,480
They wanted me to be part of a secret army,
which helped the French Resistance.

599
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:46,789
The training with the British army was very
hard and I worked night and day to learn the

600
00:43:46,789 --> 00:43:49,160
special skills.

601
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:53,940
I learned how to look after injured fighters.

602
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:56,660
I also learned to kill.

603
00:43:56,660 --> 00:44:06,460
And so I became a spy and set off on my first
mission to France.

604
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:07,460
***

605
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:12,190
I arrived in France on 29th April 1944.

606
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:18,870
At first, the French Resistance didn't believe
that I could help them.

607
00:44:18,870 --> 00:44:21,980
They didn't think that a woman could be a
fighter.

608
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:29,030
A Resistance leader told one of his men, 'This
woman could be an enemy.

609
00:44:29,030 --> 00:44:33,099
Ask her to go for a walk with you.

610
00:44:33,099 --> 00:44:37,710
When no one is around, kill her!'

611
00:44:37,710 --> 00:44:40,980
They didn't realize I could speak French.

612
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:45,339
I understood everything.

613
00:44:45,339 --> 00:44:53,080
When we went for the walk, I told the man,
'If you attack me, I will kill you first.'

614
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:59,349
He believed me and took me back to the camp.

615
00:44:59,349 --> 00:45:04,220
At last, the Resistance allowed me to join
them.

616
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:11,630
I got weapons from Britain and also took part
in their attacks against the Germans.

617
00:45:11,630 --> 00:45:16,500
We blew up railway lines and stole German
weapons.

618
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:22,420
On one occasion, I killed a German soldier.

619
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:31,859
On another, I killed a Resistance fighter
who was working for the Germans.

620
00:45:31,859 --> 00:45:32,859
***

621
00:45:32,859 --> 00:45:38,700
Our attacks against the Germans were very
successful, but it was difficult to keep everything

622
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:41,210
secret.

623
00:45:41,210 --> 00:45:47,890
Many local people were frightened of the German
soldiers and sometimes they gave the Germans

624
00:45:47,890 --> 00:45:51,329
information about our plans.

625
00:45:51,329 --> 00:45:58,910
On one occasion, someone told the Germans
about our secret radio transmitter.

626
00:45:58,910 --> 00:46:08,079
Our radio operator destroyed our codes so
the Germans didn't discover our secrets.

627
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:15,380
I cycled 500 kilometres to get new codes.

628
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:25,950
When German soldiers stopped me, I told them,
'I'm going to visit my aunt who's very ill.'

629
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:30,549
After three days, I got the codes.

630
00:46:30,549 --> 00:46:36,109
Everyone said that I was very brave, but I
didn't think about that.

631
00:46:36,109 --> 00:46:37,850
I had to do it.

632
00:46:37,850 --> 00:46:41,329
It was part of my job.

633
00:46:41,329 --> 00:46:47,950
With the new codes, I could send secret messages
to Britain.

634
00:46:47,950 --> 00:46:52,280
We could receive new weapons and start our
attacks again.

635
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:56,430
Our attacks were important.

636
00:46:56,430 --> 00:47:02,700
They stopped the progress of around 50,000
German soldiers.

637
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:10,999
These soldiers weren't able to fight the British
army, which was arriving in the north of France.

638
00:47:10,999 --> 00:47:11,999
***

639
00:47:11,999 --> 00:47:19,050
In September 1944, I received orders to go
to Paris.

640
00:47:19,050 --> 00:47:27,570
In Paris, I helped the British and French
armies in the final months of the war.

641
00:47:27,570 --> 00:47:34,599
On 8th May 1945, we heard the wonderful news.

642
00:47:34,599 --> 00:47:40,680
The war was over and the victory was ours!

643
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:44,650
I wanted to return home to my husband.

644
00:47:44,650 --> 00:47:49,040
I was shocked to discover that he was dead.

645
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:55,260
He was killed by the Germans in 1943.

646
00:47:55,260 --> 00:48:01,200
It was time for me to start a new life.

647
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:06,849
I went back to Australia and tried to become
a politician.

648
00:48:06,849 --> 00:48:13,869
I wasn't successful and life seemed boring
after the war.

649
00:48:13,869 --> 00:48:21,269
I then moved to the UK for several years and
I got an office job with the British secret

650
00:48:21,269 --> 00:48:23,640
service.

651
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:30,069
I was happy to receive many honours for my
work in the war, such as the George Medal

652
00:48:30,069 --> 00:48:33,190
from the British.

653
00:48:33,190 --> 00:48:40,380
And at the end of my life, I felt proud to
be part of one of the most important victories

654
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:41,380
in history.

655
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:46,681
The victory brought peace and freedom to Europe.

656
00:48:46,681 --> 00:48:47,681
