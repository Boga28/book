00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,040
CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,640
The Old Code

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:12,400
A sword shone in the sun.

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,240
'Not bad!' shouted Sir Bowen.

5
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:22,080
Then he pulled out his sword and 
started to fight Prince Einon.

6
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,840
The prince fell to the ground.

7
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:31,880
'But you'll have to fight harder than 
that, or you'll die!' laughed Sir Bowen.

8
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:35,600
Sir Bowen was one of King Freyne's knights.

9
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,840
Prince Einon was the king's son.

10
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:43,160
He was fourteen years old and a strong young man.

11
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:47,040
He liked fighting but he didn't like losing.

12
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:51,320
He got up quickly and took up his sword again.

13
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,440
'That's better,' laughed Bowen.

14
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,800
The young prince smiled.

15
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:03,600
Then suddenly he felt Bowen's 
sword, hard, on his arm.

16
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,080
'Dead again!' laughed Sir Bowen.

17
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,920
Einon started to fight again.

18
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,800
His face was angry now.

19
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:22,960
'Careful! Careful! Fight with your head, don't 
fight with your heart, boy!' shouted Bowen.

20
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,880
The knight wanted to make Einon a good fighter.

21
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:32,320
But he also wanted to teach him the Old Code.

22
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:40,840
Sir Bowen and all the kings, princes and 
knights before him were Knights of the Old Code.

23
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:48,160
For thousands of years kings were kind 
to peasants and knights helped kings.

24
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:51,160
This was the Old Code.

25
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:56,800
Life was good, and everybody 
in the country was happy.

26
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:02,840
Then everything started to change 
and the peasants were angry.

27
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,280
Bowen didn't like this.

28
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:14,640
He loved Einon and he wanted the boy 
to remember the Old Code all his life.

29
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:20,440
After the sword-fighting lesson, 
Bowen and Einon sat down.

30
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:28,720
'Never turn your back to somebody when you 
fight, Einon! Why can't you remember that?'

31
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,760
Suddenly they heard the sound of a horse.

32
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:40,000
They looked up and saw Brok, one of the 
king's knights, on his horse in front of them.

33
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,680
Bowen didn't like Brok and looked at him angrily.

34
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,800
Brok didn't live by the Old Code.

35
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,160
'We're fighting the peasants,' Brok told them.

36
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,160
'We're winning, of course.

37
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,840
King Freyne wants his son to come and watch.'

38
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:06,800
'It's not good or clever to fight 
the peasants,' answered Bowen.

39
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,520
He really hated Brok.

40
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:14,160
'They're stupid! The king says they have to die.

41
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:17,320
He wants Einon to come now.

42
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:22,400
And you too, Bowen,' Brok shouted.

43
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,960
Then he turned his horse and rode away fast.

44
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:31,520
'Why did he shout at you?' asked Einon.

45
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:36,520
'You're a Knight of the Old 
Code! You're not afraid of him!'

46
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:40,000
'No, of course I'm not afraid of him.

47
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,680
I hate him.

48
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,840
He doesn't live by the Old Code.

49
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,120
He enjoys killing the peasants.

50
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,600
He's the king's man.'

51
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,320
Einon understood.

52
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:58,160
Bowen hated his father, the king, too.

53
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,720
He smiled at Bowen.

54
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,160
'When my father dies, I'll be king.

55
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:08,120
And you'll be my man, Sir Bowen.'

56
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:12,560
Bowen looked at Einon with love in his eyes.

57
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:22,400
'I'm your man now, my Prince,' he answered 
warmly.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

58
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,960
CHAPTER TWO

59
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,880
The Battle

60
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,720
Brok rode quickly back to the battle.

61
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:35,200
When he got near the fighting, 
he heard the sound of swords.

62
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:42,280
He laughed loudly when he saw hundreds 
of peasants, dead on the ground.

63
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:47,320
In the middle of a field, Brok 
could see King Freyne on his horse.

64
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:51,440
The crown on the king's head shone in the sun.

65
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:56,800
On his coat was a picture of 
a dragon's head on a sword.

66
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:02,000
The king looked down at the dead 
men below him with hard eyes.

67
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,600
With a cruel smile on his 
face, he pulled out his sword.

68
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,560
The peasants on his right and left were afraid.

69
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,560
They ran away fast but the king followed them.

70
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,800
He loved fighting and killing.

71
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:22,040
Nothing could stop him now.

72
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:27,440
High above the battle, Sir Bowen 
and Prince Einon sat and watched.

73
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:32,640
Bowen hated the fighting but Einon was excited.

74
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:37,720
'I want to fight down there 
with my father,' he said.

75
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:42,560
'No, you don't, boy,' Bowen answered sadly.

76
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,600
'I do! I do!' Einon shouted.

77
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,920
'And I want to see you fight too, Sir Bowen.

78
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:53,480
You're the best fighter in the world!'

79
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:56,320
'Yes, I am a good fighter.

80
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:01,960
Better than your cruel 
father,' Bowen said angrily.

81
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:05,480
Einon felt unhappy when he heard this.

82
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:08,040
'Don't be angry with him, Bowen.

83
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:13,160
He is my father and he is the king.'

84
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,120
Bowen smiled kindly at the prince.

85
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,080
He didn't want to make Einon unhappy.

86
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:22,680
But it was difficult for him to watch the battle.

87
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:29,880
He was a Knight of the Old Code, and 
it was wrong to kill the peasants.

88
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:35,360
'Yes, Einon, your father's 
king now,' he said to the boy.

89
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:41,440
'But one day you'll be king and 
you'll wear the crown on your head.

90
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,680
When you're king, remember today.

91
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,600
And remember the Old.

92
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,680
Code.

93
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,160
Never, never fight the peasants.

94
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:55,360
Then the crown will shine 
wonderfully on your head,  

95
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,520
and you'll be a better king than your father.'

96
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:04,360
Bowen turned to watch the 
battle with a heavy heart.

97
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:08,480
He didn't see the prince's eyes when Einon spoke.

98
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:12,000
They were as hard as the king's.

99
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,400
'Yes, I'm going to be a better king 
than my father, Bowen,' answered Einon.

100
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:27,640
Then he suddenly shouted, 'Oh, look! My 
father's killing more stupid peasants!'

101
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:34,000
Down below them, the king and his knights 
rode through the peasants' village.

102
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,200
They cut down men with their 
swords and burnt their homes.

103
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:45,080
One of the peasants stood near his 
house and watched the king carefully.

104
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:51,760
This man's name was Redbeard - 
he had red hair and a red beard.

105
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:59,440
He suddenly shouted loudly, 'Now!' 
When the other men heard Redbeard,  

106
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,880
they quickly came out of their houses.

107
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,120
They looked angry and dangerous.

108
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:12,520
They ran after Redbeard to the king 
on his horse and tried to kill him.

109
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:17,920
The king rode out of the village 
fast, but the peasants followed him.

110
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:22,680
They pulled him from his 
horse and began to hit him.

111
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:29,080
Then they all jumped on him, hard.

112
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:33,120
From above, Einon watched the fighting and cried,  

113
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:43,280
'No! No! They're killing my father!' He quickly 
jumped on his horse and rode down to the battle.

114
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:51,320
'Stop, Einon! Stop!' shouted 
Bowen, but Einon didn't listen.

115
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:56,600
Bowen climbed on to his horse 
and followed fast behind the boy.

116
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:02,120
But when he got to the battle, he 
couldn't find the prince anywhere.

117
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:11,400
'Einon! Einon!' he called, 
but there was no answer.

118
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:16,960
Einon found his father on the 
ground and sat down near him.

119
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:24,400
He looked at the king's grey 
face and cried, 'Father, father!'

120
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:29,360
Then he looked at the beautiful 
crown on the king's head.

121
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:35,120
'My father's going to die,' he thought.

122
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:42,880
'I'm going to be king and I want that crown now.'

123
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:50,440
Einon started to take the crown from his father's 
head, but the king suddenly opened his eyes.

124
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:54,120
He looked at the boy and tried to stop him.

125
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:59,120
For a minute, father and son pulled at the crown.

126
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,640
But Einon was stronger and he won.

127
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:07,920
Old King Freyne looked at his son angrily.

128
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:14,000
Then he closed his eyes and died.

129
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:21,400
When Einon stood up with the crown in his 
hands, he saw a young peasant opposite him.

130
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:25,320
The man stood on a bridge with a large bucket on  

131
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:33,280
his head! He suddenly jumped off 
the bridge and fell on to Einon.

132
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:36,240
They fought for a long time.

133
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:43,760
Then the peasant, Buckethead, 
pushed his sword into Einon's heart.

134
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:50,120
The prince fell to the ground 
with his hands round the crown.

135
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:57,160
When the peasant looked down at the prince 
at his feet, the bucket fell from his head.

136
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:07,720
Einon could see a lot of lovely, long red 
hair! Buckethead was a woman, not a man.

137
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:12,400
Her name was Kara, and she 
was Redbeard's daughter.

138
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:19,080
She wore dirty, old clothes 
but she was very beautiful.

139
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,880
Suddenly somebody shouted,  

140
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:33,120
'Einon! Einon! Where are you?' When 
Kara heard this, she quickly ran away.

141
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:38,640
Sir Bowen ran to Einon and cried, 'It's me, Einon.

142
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,640
I'm here, My King.'

143
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:48,800
Einon looked up at Bowen, 
and then closed his eyes.

144
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:53,600
Bowen took the prince in his 
arms and tried to help him.

145
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,960
But the boy didn't move.

146
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:59,240
The knight could do nothing.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

147
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,720
CHAPTER THREE

148
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,280
The Great Dragon

149
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:11,480
In the king's castle, Queen 
Aislinn sat in her room.

150
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:15,520
She looked out of the window with sad eyes.

151
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:21,360
She couldn't see the battle, but she 
could hear the sound of fighting.

152
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:27,440
'The Old Code says it's wrong to 
kill the peasants,' she thought.

153
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:32,080
'My husband's a bad, cruel king.'

154
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:37,560
Suddenly Brok, the king's 
knight, ran into the room.

155
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:42,880
'Queen Aislinn, your husband's dead,' he said.

156
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,320
'The peasants killed him.

157
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:49,760
King Freyne is dead!'

158
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,160
The queen listened to Brok quietly.

159
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:56,800
Behind him she could see Sir Bowen.

160
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:03,720
His face was tired and sad and he stood 
with her son, Prince Einon, in his arms.

161
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:08,920
'I'm sorry, Queen Aislinn,' 
said Bowen, with his head down.

162
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:12,280
'The prince fell too.'

163
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:16,400
'Don't be sorry, Sir Bowen,' answered the queen.

164
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:21,400
'They killed Einon because of 
his cruel father, the king.

165
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:25,880
Now, put him on my bed.'

166
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,800
But Einon wasn't dead.

167
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:35,640
'The crown, the crown...' he said weakly.

168
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:39,480
Bowen put the crown into Einon's hands.

169
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:42,480
But the queen didn't listen to him.

170
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,000
She stood next to Bowen 
and looked down at her son.

171
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,320
Then she slowly took off his shirt.

172
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:56,480
'We can't help him now,' Bowen said sadly.

173
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,880
The queen said nothing.

174
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:06,520
She walked to the window and looked at a 
beautiful picture of a dragon on the wall.

175
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:10,840
'Perhaps we can, Bowen,' she answered.

176
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:16,080
'Perhaps we can...'

177
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:19,000
Queen Aislinn rode quickly.

178
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,720
She turned her horse and started to 
climb the mountain behind the castle.

179
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,040
Brok rode in front of her and Sir Bowen followed.

180
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:36,080
Behind them two men carried 
Einon carefully up the mountain.

181
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:44,880
After a long time, Bowen heard the 
sound of music - a strange, sad song.

182
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:49,600
It came from somewhere inside the mountain.

183
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,640
Then Einon made a sound and his eyes closed.

184
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:59,040
Bowen got off his horse fast 
and ran to the young boy.

185
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:03,800
'Wake up! Wake up!' he shouted.

186
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,640
'Don't go to sleep, My King.

187
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,760
You can't die now.

188
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:15,000
Listen to me, and remember the Old Code.

189
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,680
Bowen then spoke quietly into Einon's ear.

190
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,840
He talked to him about the Old Code.

191
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:29,000
Einon moved his mouth and 
tried to repeat Bowen's words.

192
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,160
He didn't want to die on the cold mountain.

193
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:39,280
They climbed slowly up the mountain, then stopped.

194
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:44,560
The queen got off her horse and 
turned to the men behind her.

195
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,400
'This is the end of our journey.

196
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:51,400
We're going into the mountain now.'

197
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:57,400
It was a cold, dark place and it looked dangerous.

198
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,640
'Follow me.

199
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:02,680
Don't be afraid,' said the queen.

200
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:06,600
She walked in and the men followed her.

201
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,560
They couldn't see much.

202
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:14,720
There was a lot of smoke, and there were 
dead animals on the ground near their feet.

203
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:19,800
Then Bowen heard the strange song again.

204
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,960
Suddenly, the music stopped.

205
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:32,560
From out of the dark, somebody asked 
sadly, 'Are the stars shining tonight?'

206
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:40,280
'No, there aren't any stars in the 
sky tonight,' answered the queen.

207
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:47,800
'Is that Queen Aislinn, wife of 
King Freyne?' said the dragon.

208
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,960
'Yes, Great Dragon.

209
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:54,760
The people in my country love 
you and the other dragons.

210
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:57,680
We're your friends.'

211
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,960
'No, Madam,' answered the dragon.

212
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:07,360
'Men and dragons were friends 
for thousands of years.

213
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:12,520
But things are different now.'

214
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:19,360
The dragon came slowly out of the dark 
and sat on the ground near the queen.

215
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:24,480
'Bring Einon here, Bowen,' said the queen.

216
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,840
The knight carried Einon in his 
arms and put him down on the ground.

217
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,560
The dragon's face was high above him.

218
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:43,440
It was very ugly - brown and black, with 
a large mouth, big teeth, and sad eyes.

219
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:50,560
Bowen felt very afraid - he never 
took his eyes away from that face!

220
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:54,120
The dragon looked down at Einon.

221
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:59,320
'It's King Freyne's son!' he said.

222
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,600
'I hated the king.

223
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:06,520
He loved killing dragons and peasants.

224
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:10,880
What do you want from me, Queen Aislinn?'

225
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,640
'I want your help,' answered the queen.

226
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,360
'A peasant hurt my child in the battle.

227
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:22,320
Einon's not the same as his father, Great Dragon.

228
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,760
This knight, Sir Bowen, is 
teaching him the Old Code.

229
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:31,200
And I'm going to teach him 
about dragons in the future.

230
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,320
Please help him.'

231
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:36,240
'You're asking a lot, Madam.

232
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,920
Your son's very ill,' said the dragon.

233
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,600
'I know,' cried the queen.

234
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,720
'But he's king now.

235
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,520
He'll be a good king.

236
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,360
Sir Bowen and I will help him.

237
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:53,760
He won't be cruel, Great Dragon.'

238
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:58,720
'He has to say that, not 
you,' answered the dragon.

239
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,080
Then he looked at Bowen.

240
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:07,880
'Give me your sword, Knight.'

241
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:12,800
Bowen pulled out his sword 
and gave it to the dragon.

242
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:17,760
The dragon stood over Einon, 
with the sword in his hands.

243
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,520
The boy opened his eyes.

244
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:25,120
He saw the dragon, and tried to move away.

245
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,720
'Don't be afraid, son,' said the queen quietly.

246
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:33,880
'The Great Dragon's going to help you.'

247
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,800
'I will help you, boy.

248
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:44,960
But first you have to say these 
words: "I won't be a cruel king.

249
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,760
I won't kill dragons and peasants.

250
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:53,760
I'll love my people and be kind to them.

251
00:19:53,760 --> 00:20:06,440
I'll always live by the Old Code." Now, 
are you ready? Repeat them after me!

252
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:11,440
Einon was very tired, but he 
repeated the dragon's words.

253
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,560
Then he fell back into Bowen's arms.

254
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:20,000
'Einon, Einon!' shouted Bowen.

255
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,240
'No, no! He's dead!'

256
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:31,400
Bowen was very angry and tried to 
pull his sword away from the dragon.

257
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:36,240
But the dragon shouted, 'Knight of the Old Code.

258
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:42,240
Stop! Watch me! Now!'

259
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:51,160
Then he pushed Bowen's sword into his 
heart! A red light came out of the dragon.

260
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:56,760
He caught the light in his 
hands and turned to Einon.

261
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:01,640
'This light's half my heart, boy.

262
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:05,040
I'm giving it to you.

263
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,720
It'll make you strong.

264
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:18,600
Enjoy a long life and always 
remember the words of the Old Code.'

265
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,760
Einon's eyes slowly opened.

266
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,960
He felt weak, but he wasn't dead.

267
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:31,000
Bowen looked at the boy, then 
he looked up at the dragon.

268
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,680
'I'm sorry, Great Dragon.

269
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,840
I was angry and afraid.

270
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,800
Thank you.'

271
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:43,040
'You can help Einon now, Sir Bowen.

272
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:46,880
Teach him the Old Code well.

273
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:52,560
Never forget my words.'

274
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:58,120
Before Bowen could answer, the 
dragon went back into the mountain.

275
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:01,880
Everything was dark and cold again.

276
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:11,960
Nobody spoke they listened to the sound of 
the strange, sad music.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

277
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,800
CHAPTER FOUR

278
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:17,520
Cruel King Einon

279
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:21,720
Einon sat on his horse, high above the peasants.

280
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:28,520
He looked strong and happy with his father's 
crown on his head and his sword in his hand.

281
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:32,600
'I'm king now,' he thought.

282
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:35,360
'I love watching my peasants.

283
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:39,200
They're building me a wonderful new castle.

284
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:44,120
It's going to be bigger and better 
than my father's old castle.

285
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:49,400
It's going to be the greatest 
castle in the world!'

286
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:54,640
King Einon was as hard and 
cruel as his father now.

287
00:22:54,640 --> 00:23:01,080
He never remembered the words of the Old 
Code, or the Great Dragon in the mountain.

288
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:08,880
He hated the peasants, and they had 
to work harder and harder every day.

289
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:15,440
Brok, old King Freyne's knight, 
rode past Einon on his horse.

290
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:20,680
Behind Brok, some peasants 
walked slowly up to the castle.

291
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:23,600
They looked weak and ill.

292
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:27,400
They didn't look up at the 
king when they walked past.

293
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:36,520
But Einon looked down at them and suddenly 
shouted loudly, 'Stop, Brok! Stop!'

294
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:40,280
Brok quickly jumped down from his horse.

295
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:50,680
'Look, Brok! There! That peasant there! 
That's Redbeard! He killed my father!'

296
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:57,640
Einon and Brok looked at the tall, strong 
peasant with the red hair and red beard.

297
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:03,560
Redbeard looked back at 
them with hate in his eyes.

298
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:09,080
'Yes, I killed your father, 
boy!' he shouted at Einon.

299
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,200
'You can thank me now.

300
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:16,240
Now you're king and the crown's on your head.'

301
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:21,560
Brok ran to Redbeard and put 
his sword up near his face.

302
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:24,280
'No!' Einon shouted.

303
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,160
'Don't kill him.

304
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:32,240
That's too kind.' He smiled cruelly at Redbeard.

305
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:36,480
'Look at me, dog! Look carefully.

306
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:42,880
You can see me now, but you'll 
never see me or anything again.

307
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,040
Get some wood from the fire, Brok.

308
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:50,520
Burn out his eyes!'

309
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:53,960
Brok got some wood from a hot fire.

310
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:58,320
Redbeard watched him angrily but he wasn't afraid.

311
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:06,400
Brok put the burning wood near Redbeard's 
eyes, then he suddenly stopped.

312
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:12,920
He felt a sword on his arm, and the 
wood fell from his hands to the ground.

313
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:17,360
He looked up quickly and saw Sir Bowen.

314
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:26,520
Bowen called to the peasants, 'Run away! 
Quickly! Run!' The peasants understood.

315
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:33,000
They ran away from King Einon and 
his castle as fast as they could.

316
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:38,200
Kara, Redbeard's beautiful 
daughter, ran to her father.

317
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:43,840
'Father! Father! Are you all right?' she cried.

318
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:47,200
'Kara! Quickly!' shouted Redbeard.

319
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,320
'Let's go.

320
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:55,280
Run!' And Redbeard and Kara 
followed the other peasants.

321
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:58,240
King Einon was very angry with Bowen.

322
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:03,880
He jumped down from his horse 
and pulled out his sword.

323
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:08,240
'What are you doing, Bowen?' he shouted angrily.

324
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:17,080
'Those are my peasants, not yours! Who's 
king in this country? Me! Not you!'

325
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:21,960
Bowen got off his horse and 
pulled out his sword too.

326
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:28,240
They started to fight, but after a 
few minutes, Einon fell to the ground.

327
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:34,040
Bowen stood over the boy and looked down at him.

328
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:38,600
'Einon,' he said, 'don't do this.

329
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:45,800
What's wrong with you? Are you 
ill? Remember the Old Code, Einon.

330
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:52,640
Remember my words and the 
words of the Great Dragon.'

331
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:56,440
'I'm king now,' Einon shouted back.

332
00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:01,640
'Kings don't have to live by the Old Code!'

333
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:05,040
Bowen couldn't understand Einon.

334
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:11,760
He took him by the arm and cried, 
'I taught you the Old Code, boy.

335
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,880
I taught you everything.

336
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,880
Never forget that.

337
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:19,000
What's wrong with you?'

338
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,400
But Einon didn't listen.

339
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:27,080
He pulled his arm away and 
started to fight Bowen again.

340
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:30,160
Again, he fell to the ground.

341
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:33,560
Bowen looked down at him sadly.

342
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:37,480
'Fight with your head, boy!' he said.

343
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:41,680
'Don't fight with your heart!'

344
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:51,240
His heart! His heart! Bowen thought 
about the dragon's words in the mountain:  

345
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:55,840
'This light's half my heart, boy.

346
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:06,720
I'm giving it to you.' Why was Einon as cruel as 
his father now? Was it because he had a dragon's  

347
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:16,120
heart, not a man's heart? Bowen threw his 
sword down on the ground next to Einon.

348
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:22,280
He sat down near him on the 
ground and looked into his eyes.

349
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:26,840
'Everybody has to live by the Old Code, Einon.

350
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:32,520
Kings, knights and peasants 
- everybody in the country.

351
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:36,760
Why can't you understand that?'

352
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:39,320
Then he slowly stood up.

353
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:44,200
He got on his horse, and rode away.

354
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:51,080
Brok wanted to ride after Bowen, but 
King Einon said, 'Let: him go, Brok.

355
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,920
He's an old man.

356
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:55,400
He doesn't understand.

357
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,160
I don't want him to help me now.

358
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:01,760
I'm a king, not a child.

359
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,400
Go and find Redbeard.

360
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:11,120
And when you find him, burn 
out the stupid peasant's eyes!'

361
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:15,680
Brok rode away fast and looked for Redbeard.

362
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:23,160
When he found him, he burnt out 
his eyes, slowly and cruelly.

363
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:33,440
The peasant could never see Kara, 
his beautiful daughter, again.

364
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:38,280
Bowen slowly rode away from 
Einon with a heavy heart.

365
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:43,280
He thought hard about the boy and the dragon.

366
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:46,480
'Einon isn't a cruel boy.

367
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,680
But he's got half the dragon's heart.

368
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,480
That's the problem.

369
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:54,280
It's the dragons heart.

370
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:58,040
So now, he's as bad as his father.

371
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:02,640
I'm going to find that dragon...

372
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:06,000
and kill him!'

373
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,480
The knight rode quickly back 
to Queen Aislinn's castle.

374
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:17,160
Then he started on his long 
journey to find the dragon.

375
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:23,800
After many days, he arrived at the 
dragon's cold, dark home in, the mountain.

376
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:27,960
But this time the dragon wasn't there.

377
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:39,040
Bowen shouted loudly, 'Dragon! Can you hear 
me? Where are you, Dragon? Why did you do  

378
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:49,560
it? Why did you give my King half your cruel 
heart? I'll never stop looking for you, Dragon.

379
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:52,720
And when I find you...'

380
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,560
Bowen stopped shouting.

381
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,920
He stood in the dark and listened.

382
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:06,800
Outside, from somewhere above him, he 
could hear the dragon's strange song.

383
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:11,280
He quickly jumped on his horse and rode away.

384
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:14,360
He wanted to find the music...

385
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:19,960
and the dragon.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

386
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,440
CHAPTER FIVE

387
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:25,480
Sir Bowen and the Dragon

388
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:30,560
Sir Bowen rode up the mountain 
all day and all night.

389
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:36,520
Early the next morning he saw an 
old man on the road in front of him.

390
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:39,280
'Who's this?' he thought.

391
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:48,560
Who's he talking to? And why is he riding 
a horse and writing at the same time?'

392
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:51,560
'Old man!' he shouted.

393
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:56,520
'Be careful! Look at the road, not at your books.

394
00:31:56,520 --> 00:32:00,960
Now please, move out of my way.'

395
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,800
The old man turned round and saw Bowen.

396
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:08,760
Then suddenly his face went white.

397
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,720
He looked very afraid.

398
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:16,440
'No! Help! There's a dra...

399
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,000
dra...

400
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,840
drag...'

401
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,240
'What is it?' asked Bowen.

402
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,920
'What's wrong?'

403
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,120
'Be...

404
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,320
be...

405
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:31,600
behind you,' answered the old man.

406
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,920
'Look behind you!'

407
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:37,800
Bowen turned round quickly.

408
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:42,120
Behind him, there was a big, ugly dragon in the  

409
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:49,320
sky! The knight pulled out his 
sword and they began to fight.

410
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:54,880
This dragon wasn't as big or strong 
as the Great Dragon in the mountain.

411
00:32:54,880 --> 00:33:00,680
In minutes, it fell to the ground 
with Bowen's sword in its heart.

412
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:07,160
Then everything went very quiet.

413
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:10,160
The old man spoke first.

414
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:18,000
'Oh, thank you, thank you, Knight! 
That dragon looked very dangerous.

415
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:24,480
We nearly died! I'd like to 
thank you a thousand times!'

416
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:30,240
'All right, all right, it's 
dead now,' answered Bowen.

417
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:36,640
'Old man, what's your name? 
And what are you doing here?'

418
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:41,160
'My name's Brother Gilbert, and I'm a monk.

419
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:47,160
I ride on my horse round the 
country and try to help people.

420
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:50,840
And I write stories about my journeys.

421
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:57,720
I write about kings and knights, 
about dragons and the Old Code.'

422
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:03,320
'Well, I'm on a long journey too, Brother.

423
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:08,840
So I'll say goodbye now,' answered Bowen.

424
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:15,440
'Will you ride with me, 
Knight? asked Brother Gilbert.

425
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:19,600
'Yes, I'd like to ride with you, Brother.

426
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,480
We can talk.

427
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,880
Let's go.'

428
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:27,720
And the two men went slowly up the mountain.

429
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:33,040
When it was dark, they stopped for the night.

430
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:39,200
They were hungry and thirsty, and 
they cooked some meat on a hot fire.

431
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:43,360
Then the monk read one of his stories to Bowen.

432
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:48,880
It was a story about the Old Code.

433
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:57,400
'What do you think, Sir Bowen? Did you 
like it?' asked Brother Gilbert at the end.

434
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:02,440
'I liked the meat, Brother, but not your story.

435
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:06,680
The Old Code's dead,' said Bowen sadly.

436
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:11,200
'Nobody lives by the Old Code now.'

437
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:19,200
'Ride with me, good Knight, and find the 
Old Code again,' answered Brother Gilbert.

438
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,120
'I'll ride with you, Brother.

439
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:24,280
But I'm not going to look for the Old Code.

440
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:26,680
I'm looking for a dragon.

441
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:32,240
And when I find it, I'm going to kill it!'

442
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:38,000
The next morning Bowen and Brother 
Gilbert climbed on their horses again.

443
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,520
They talked and laughed.

444
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:44,240
The monk told Bowen more stories.

445
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:50,480
After some time, Gilbert got off his 
horse and sat down on the ground.

446
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:56,560
He started to write a story 
about Bowen and the dragon.

447
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:04,600
Suddenly the ground round the monk began to 
move and his pen fell out of his fingers.

448
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:08,880
Then his papers flew everywhere.

449
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:15,000
'Help! Help! What's happening?' he shouted.

450
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:20,760
Bowen turned round on his horse and saw 
the monk with his papers on the ground.

451
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:29,880
Then, in the river behind him, he saw a 
dragon! He rode quickly down to the river.

452
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:36,160
When he got there, he heard the 
dragon's strange song again.

453
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:43,840
'Don't come into this river, Knight, 
or you'll die!' the dragon said.

454
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:47,880
'I'm not afraid of you,' shouted Bowen.

455
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:52,040
'Aren't you?' shouted the dragon.

456
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:56,800
'Then look at this!'

457
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:03,360
Out of the river, the dragon 
threw a dead man and his horse.

458
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:14,080
'That man tried to follow me into the river! 
Look at him now! And there are more down here!'

459
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:17,160
Brother Gilbert stood behind Bowen.

460
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,240
He was very afraid.

461
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:24,040
But the knight got off his 
horse and pulled out his sword.

462
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:27,160
'Come and fight me, Dragon,' he shouted.

463
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:30,520
'You can't hurt me.'

464
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:36,240
The dragon carne slowly out of 
the river and went behind a tree.

465
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:43,560
Bowen could feel the hot fire from the dragon's 
nose, but he couldn't see him very well.

466
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:49,760
On the ground, round the tree, 
were dead men and horses.

467
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:52,560
Bowen moved nearer the tree.

468
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:57,560
He felt afraid, but he didn't 
want the dragon to know.

469
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:00,400
'Why is all that fire coming out of your nose,  

470
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:08,120
Dragon? It's too wet in the river to 
start a fire, you know!' he laughed.

471
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:12,680
'Why do you knights always want to fight and  

472
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:19,520
kill us? Do you think it'll make 
you famous?' the dragon asked.

473
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:24,960
'I don't want to be famous,' answered 
Bowen, with his sword in his hand.

474
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,120
'But I want to be rich.

475
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:31,120
These days people pay me for dead dragons.

476
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:34,560
And I'm going to kill you.'

477
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:44,680
'Oh, you kill dragons for money! 
You're that knight!' said the dragon.

478
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:50,160
'Well, I have to live,' answered Bowen.

479
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:57,600
'Yes, everybody has to live,' laughed the dragon.

480
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:01,120
'Let's start the battle then.'

481
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:04,480
'Yes, let's,' shouted Bowen.

482
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:08,640
'I'll enjoy killing you!'

483
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,080
Bowen moved nearer.

484
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:17,240
The dragon watched him and 
then he saw the knight's sword.

485
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:21,760
'I know that sword,' he thought.

486
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:27,680
'I used it in the mountain 
to cut out half my heart  

487
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:36,160
for King Einon.' He suddenly left 
the ground and flew up into the sky.

488
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:42,720
He flew higher and higher, above 
Sir Bowen and Brother Gilbert.

489
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:48,760
The knight quickly climbed on to 
his horse and rode after the dragon.

490
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:57,320
Bowen followed him for a long time but in the 
end, he got down from his horse, tired and angry.

491
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:02,600
Then the dragon flew down from the sky.

492
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:06,200
'You're clever,' shouted Bowen.

493
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:09,080
'Cleverer than the other dragons.

494
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:13,920
Come here! I want a good fight.'

495
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:19,720
'Well, it'll be your last,' said the dragon.

496
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:22,040
They started to fight.

497
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:27,040
The dragon hit Bowen hard 
and he fell back into a tree.

498
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:31,800
He got up quickly and shouted, 
'You won't win, you know.

499
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:35,800
I'm going to kill all dragons.'

500
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:38,840
'There's only me, Knight.

501
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:42,680
I'm the last dragon.'

502
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:48,320
Bowen didn't know that this was 
the last dragon in the country.

503
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:53,160
When he heard this, he 
stopped fighting for a minute.

504
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:57,040
The dragon watched him and came nearer.

505
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:02,040
He pushed Bowen hard and the knight fell over.

506
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:05,800
Bowen could feel the fire from the dragon's nose.

507
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,880
It burnt his face.

508
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:10,520
He heard Brother Gilbert shout.

509
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:16,920
Then everything went black...

510
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:23,160
When Bowen woke up, he was 
inside the dragon's mouth.

511
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:29,440
He pulled out his sword and shouted, 
'Don't bring your teeth down, Dragon.

512
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:36,440
Or my sword will go up.' Nothing happened.

513
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:41,680
Bowen sat in the dragon's mouth all day.

514
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:47,000
Outside, Brother Gilbert watched and waited.

515
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:55,920
In the evening, the dragon tried to speak, 
but it was difficult with Bowen in his mouth!

516
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:59,480
'Don't put your sword ufp.

517
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:06,320
Or ma teef come down,' he said.

518
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:09,960
Bowen looked round the dragon's mouth.

519
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:15,000
He saw an old shirt between 
two of the dragon's teeth.

520
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:20,760
He pulled it out and a 
man's hand came out with it.

521
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:27,120
'Oh, that's Sir Eglamore's shirt!' 
he cried, and threw it away.

522
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:32,400
'Thannffs!' said the dragon.

523
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:43,000
That's been ufp dere fa monffs! 
Now get your sword off ma teef.'

524
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:50,960
'Oh be quiet! It's hard for me 
too, you know,' answered Bowen.

525
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:56,880
The conversation was very boring 
and difficult for the dragon.

526
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:05,400
'Oh, ma mouf if dry,' said 
the dragon after a short time.

527
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:16,280
'Listen, get out aff ma mouf 
and led's talk face to face.'

528
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:21,280
Bowen got up slowly and the 
dragon opened his mouth.

529
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:25,480
The knight stood between his big, dirty teeth.

530
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:32,760
With his sword in his hands, he looked 
up at the dragon - he felt very afraid.

531
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:39,440
Then he suddenly fell on to the ground 
outside with his sword next to him.

532
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:44,400
'Kill me, then!' he shouted up to the dragon.

533
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:50,400
'I don't want to kill you,' 
said the dragon quietly.

534
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:54,240
'And I don't want you to kill me.

535
00:43:54,240 --> 00:44:00,400
I'm old and tired and I don't want to fight.

536
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:03,040
I've got an idea.

537
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:05,160
Listen.'

538
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:07,880
Bowen was tired and hungry.

539
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:10,760
He wanted to eat and sleep.

540
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:16,480
He looked up at the dragon 
and said weakly, 'So tell me.

541
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:27,120
What's your idea?'
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

542
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:28,840
CHAPTER SIX

543
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:32,720
The Dragon's Idea

544
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:38,840
The dragon began to tell Bowen his clever idea.

545
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:45,960
At the same time, down below them, the 
peasants worked hard in Sir Felton's fields.

546
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:51,080
Sir Felton was one of King Einon's rich knights.

547
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:57,080
One of the boys suddenly stopped 
his work and looked up at the sky.

548
00:44:57,080 --> 00:45:00,720
'Father, father!' he cried.

549
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:06,720
Look! Up there!' The peasants looked at the boy.

550
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:09,920
Then they looked up at the sky.

551
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:14,680
There, above them, was the dragon!

552
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:19,400
'Help! He's coming down!' they shouted.

553
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:30,120
'Look at that fire! It coming out of his 
nose! It's going to burn us! Run! Fast!'

554
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:33,480
The dragon flew down to the ground.

555
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:42,520
He started to burn down Sir Felton's fields and 
buildings - there was fire and smoke everywhere.

556
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:47,600
Sir Felton heard the peasants 
and quickly ran out of his house.

557
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:49,720
But before he could say a word,  

558
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:59,320
somebody behind him said, 'Look at 
that! Those dragons! Can I help?'

559
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:03,280
Sir Felton was very, very angry.

560
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:08,760
He looked round and saw Sir 
Bowen with a smile on his face.

561
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:11,760
'Stupid dragon!' he shouted.

562
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:18,600
'Look! My fields! And my 
buildings! They're burning!'

563
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:22,640
'Well, I can help you,' answered Bowen.

564
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:27,280
'But you'll have to pay me - 
it'll cost a lot of money.'

565
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:31,840
'I won't pay you anything,' 
shouted back Sir Felton.

566
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:34,160
'Do you hear me?'

567
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:38,280
He turned and started to go back into his house.

568
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:41,800
But the house use was also on fire.

569
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:54,040
'No, no! Not my house too! Don't burn 
beautiful house! Help!' Sir Felton cried.

570
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:57,320
And he ran back to Bowen fast.

571
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:58,640
'Here.

572
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:00,480
Take this money.

573
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:01,680
Quickly.

574
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:04,800
Do something.'

575
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:09,080
Minutes later, Bowen and the peasants were ready.

576
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:15,000
When the dragon flew over them, 
they started to throw things at him.

577
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:22,240
This was the dragon's wonderful 
idea! He cried, 'Oh...

578
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:26,840
oh...

579
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:35,640
oh!' Then he slowly fell down from the sky 
and into a river near Sir Felton's house.

580
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:41,160
'He's dying! He's dying!' shouted the peasants.

581
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:50,880
Look, he's in the river!' They all laughed 
happily, but Sir Felton looked very angry.

582
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:54,280
'Get my money back,' he shouted at them.

583
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:56,440
'Run after that knight.

584
00:47:56,440 --> 00:48:05,040
He's got my money.' The peasants ran 
after Sir Bowen as fast as they could.

585
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:07,080
Bowen didn't wait.

586
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:13,160
He quickly jumped on to his horse 
near the river and rode away.

587
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:18,280
With Sir Felton's money in 
his hand, he laughed loudly.

588
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:27,040
We did it! It was easy! Clever 
dragon!' He looked down at the money.

589
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:29,360
'Now let's see.

590
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:33,120
How much have we got?'

591
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:39,080
A long way down the river, the 
dragon's head came up out of the water.

592
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:44,440
He swam round and round and waited for Sir Bowen.

593
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:53,840
When the knight saw him, he called, 'Well, Dragon, 
your idea was wonderful! They think you're dead.

594
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:56,720
And we made a lot of money.'

595
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:04,400
'There's a lot of money in the world, 
Knight,' answered the dragon sadly.

596
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:10,200
'You'll find it all, and then you won't want me.'

597
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:14,120
'No, Dragon,' answered Bowen.

598
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:17,360
'I'm a Knight of the Old Code.

599
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:20,640
I'll never forget you.'

600
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:23,800
The dragon swam round in the river.

601
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:26,720
He looked up at the night on his horse.

602
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:30,280
'You've got Sir Felton's money.

603
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:35,120
But do you feel bad now?' he asked.

604
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:38,320
'You didn't really kill me.'

605
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:41,200
Bowen looked down at the dragon.

606
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:43,880
'No, I don't feel bad.

607
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:50,400
Sir Felton doesn't live by the Old 
Code - he's cruel to the peasants.'

608
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:55,200
'Yes, but when you took his money, he was angry.

609
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:58,520
And he'll be angry with the peasants now.

610
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:02,000
They'll have to work harder and harder.

611
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:06,560
And he won't pay them a 
penny,' answered the dragon.

612
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:09,920
'That's not my problem,' shouted Bowen.

613
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:13,080
'You don't understand the Old Code.

614
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:15,920
You're only a dragon!'

615
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:21,560
'All right, don't be angry, 
Knight,' said the dragon quietly.

616
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:25,400
'I do know about the Old Code.

617
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:31,200
And I know you tried to live by it.'

618
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:35,200
'Yes, but nobody wanted to listen to me.

619
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:40,560
So now I'm not going to 
try,' answered Bowen sadly.

620
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:44,560
'I can't change the world, Dragon.'

621
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:50,880
The dragon's eyes were as 
sad and tired as Bowen's.

622
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:54,760
They started moving down the river again.

623
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:59,840
When evening came, the dragon 
and Bowen stopped for dinner.

624
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:03,840
They were near cruel King Einon's castle.

625
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:07,720
Bowen was hungry and ate quickly.

626
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:15,760
The dragon waited and then asked, 
'Why do you hate dragons, Knight?'

627
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:19,520
'I don't hate all dragons,' Bowen answered.

628
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:24,160
'I hate one dragon and I wanted to kill him.

629
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:26,120
But I never found him.

630
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:28,760
And now I'll never find him.

631
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:34,120
You're the last dragon, so he's dead.'

632
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:42,960
'Tell me,' said the dragon quietly, 
'why did you hate that dragon?'

633
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:46,960
'He only had half a heart, 'Bowen answered.

634
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:50,120
'He gave the other half to King Einon.

635
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:53,880
But it made Einon cruel and bad.

636
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:58,680
When he had the dragon's 
heart, he forgot the Old Code.

637
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:05,680
He killed peasants and he was as 
cruel as his father, King Freyne.'

638
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:11,080
The dragon listened and he 
began to look very angry.

639
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:18,040
'Einon was bad before he met 
that dragon,' he shouted.

640
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:24,480
'He was cruel before he got 
half the dragon's heart.'

641
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:26,520
Bowen stood up quickly.

642
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:32,520
'How do you know that?' he asked.

643
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:37,800
The dragon knew because he was 
the Great Dragon in the mountain.

644
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:41,760
He gave Einon half his heart.

645
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:46,280
But he didn't want to discuss that with Bowen.

646
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:47,360
'Well...

647
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:48,480
urn...

648
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:53,360
all dragons know that,' he said.

649
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:56,440
'They know that Einon was a cruel child.

650
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:02,040
And now he's a cruel king.'

651
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:04,520
Bowen didn't like this.

652
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:07,600
The dragon's words made him unhappy.

653
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:14,200
'No! I knew Einon when he was 
little! He was a good boy.

654
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:18,840
I taught him the Old Code,' he cried.

655
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:25,120
'Then he was cruel to you too,' said the dragon.

656
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:28,720
He stood nose-to-nose with Bowen.

657
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:31,040
'He broke your heart.

658
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:36,440
And he broke the kind dragon's heart too.'

659
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:40,960
'No, Dragon, he didn't,' shouted Sir Bowen.

660
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:49,600
'Oh, stop calling me "dragon"! 
I've got a name, you know!'

661
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:55,200
'What is it then, Dragon?' asked Bowen.

662
00:53:55,200 --> 00:54:03,600
'Well, uh, I can't say it in your 
language,' answered the dragon.

663
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:04,640
'Go on.

664
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:20,447
Try,' said Bowen.

665
00:54:20,447 --> 00:54:20,454
'Arr...

666
00:54:20,454 --> 00:54:20,459
er...

667
00:54:20,459 --> 00:54:20,466
awrr...

668
00:54:20,466 --> 00:54:20,480
ow-w-wsh-s...'

669
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:22,840
'You're right, 'laughed Bowen.

670
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:25,720
'I can't say that.'

671
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:29,400
He turned to put some more wood on the fire.

672
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:35,040
With his back to the dragon, 
he suddenly heard a sad sound.

673
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:40,040
He turned and saw the dragon on the ground.

674
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:42,080
'Aah.

675
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:46,880
It hurts,' said the dragon.

676
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:51,640
He closed his eyes and put his hand on his heart.

677
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:56,760
Bowen could see a red light 
near the dragon's heart.

678
00:54:56,760 --> 00:55:04,560
He quickly put some water on the light, 
and the dragon slowly opened his eyes.

679
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:07,280
'Thank you.

680
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:11,680
I'm all right now,' he said.

681
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:14,840
'What was it?' asked Bowen.

682
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:18,320
'Oh nothing.

683
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:26,280
I had a bad accident once, 
and it hurts sometimes.'

684
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:31,240
'I hope our conversation didn't 
make you unhappy,' said Bowen.

685
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:34,760
'It wasn't you,' said the dragon.

686
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:38,160
'Not you.'

687
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:43,680
That night Bowen sat next to 
the dragon for a long time.

688
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:47,600
He watched the red light near the dragon's heart.

689
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:52,080
The colour got slowly weaker and weaker.

690
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:56,240
In the middle of the night, 
the dragon opened his eyes.

691
00:55:57,840 --> 00:56:03,200
'Why aren't you asleep?' he 
asked, when he saw Bowen.

692
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:05,600
'I didn't want to sleep.

693
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:10,840
I wanted to think of a name 
for you,' answered Bowen.

694
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:13,840
'And I found a name.

695
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:15,400
Up there.

696
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:18,600
Can you see those stars?'

697
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:22,040
The dragon looked up at the sky.

698
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:25,680
'Yes,' he said.

699
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:31,120
'We call those stars Draco,' said Bowen.

700
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:37,360
'In our language, "draco" 
is the same as "dragon".'

701
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:44,640
'And would you like to call 
me Draco?' laughed the dragon.

702
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:46,600
'No, you're right.

703
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:51,640
It's a stupid idea,' said 
Bowen, with his head down.

704
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:55,320
'No,' said the dragon kindly.

705
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:56,240
'It's not stupid.

706
00:56:57,560 --> 00:57:00,720
I like the name Draco.

707
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:02,760
Thank you, Knight.

708
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:07,480
And have you got a name?'

709
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:11,720
'Yes, my name's Bowen.'

710
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:16,360
'Thank you Bowen,' said Draco.

711
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:22,200
And he put his arm, round the 
Knight.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

712
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:23,920
CHAPTER SEVEN

713
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:26,160
A Sad Day for Kara

714
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:33,600
King Einon sat on his horse 
and looked at his new castle.

715
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:34,640
'Good.

716
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:38,480
The peasants are working hard,' he thought.

717
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:39,840
'I was right.

718
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:46,880
This is going to be the biggest and 
most beautiful castle in the world.'

719
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:52,240
Below him, the peasants 
worked hard in the hot sun.

720
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:58,160
They were all hungry and thirsty 
but they couldn't stop work.

721
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:04,880
Kara, Redbeard's beautiful daughter, 
walked round with a large bucket of water.

722
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:08,280
She gave the men a drink when she spoke to them.

723
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:17,520
She wore old, dark clothes, but she looked 
lovely with her long, red hair and kind face.

724
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:20,800
Kara went to an old man.

725
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:23,960
It was her father, Redbeard.

726
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:27,440
His hair and beard were grey now.

727
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:33,160
He wore old clothes too, and 
his hands and arms were dirty.

728
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:36,680
'Drink, father,' Kara said.

729
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:39,280
She looked at her father's eyes.

730
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:46,680
'Cruel King Einon burnt your eyes, dear 
father, but you have to eat and drink.'

731
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:49,480
'Kara! Don't come here.

732
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:51,360
It's dangerous.

733
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:56,040
Please go home!' said the old 
man, when he heard his daughter.

734
00:58:56,680 --> 00:58:57,800
'No, father.

735
00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:59,840
I'm not listening to you.

736
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:03,440
Drink!' Kara said.

737
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:07,400
The old man put his hand up to her face.

738
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:10,200
'You're not a child now.

739
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:15,920
You're a woman, a beautiful woman,' Redbeard said.

740
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:20,840
'One day the king or one of 
his knights will see you.

741
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:23,120
And they'll want you.

742
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:25,600
Go home, Kara!'

743
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:29,400
'You're my home, father,' answered Kara.

744
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:32,080
'Now drink this.

745
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:36,080
'And she gave the old man a cup of water.

746
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:41,920
Suddenly a sword pushed the 
cup out of Redbeard's hand.

747
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:43,840
Kara looked up.

748
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:50,120
In front of her, she saw Einon 
and his knights on their horses.

749
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:54,160
'That was clever, King Einon,' laughed Sir Felton.

750
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:56,040
'Now try the water bucket.

751
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:57,320
There.

752
00:59:57,320 --> 01:00:01,320
Behind the stupid old peasant!'

753
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:05,760
Einon laughed and pushed 
the bucket with his sword.

754
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:09,000
The water went over Redbeard.

755
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:14,240
'Don't move, father,' said Kara quietly.

756
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:19,080
She left her father and went 
to King Einon and Sir Felton.

757
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:26,080
The knight threw his sword down hard 
at Kara's feet, but she wasn't afraid.

758
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:29,560
'Look at the girl!' shouted Einon.

759
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:32,040
'What are you doing?'

760
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:36,160
'My father's an old man, King Einon,' Kara cried.

761
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:38,240
'He can't fight you now.

762
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:40,760
Please, don't hurt him.'

763
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:47,280
'Don't hurt him?' Einon shouted, 
and quickly moved nearer Redbeard.

764
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:53,520
Then he pushed his sword hard 
into the peasant's heart.

765
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:59,720
'Father!' shouted Kara and ran 
to the old man on the ground.

766
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:03,160
Einon watched and smiled.

767
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:08,000
'Your father's dead!' he laughed.

768
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,640
Kara had Redbeard in her arms.

769
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:15,440
Her beautiful, long red hair fell down her back.

770
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:18,080
Einon looked at her.

771
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:23,840
He remembered the girl's 
lovely hear, but not her name.

772
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:27,200
'Who is she?' he thought.

773
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:29,040
'She's beautiful.

774
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:34,160
What's her name? Where does she come from?'

775
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:39,760
Then he turned his horse and started to ride away.

776
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:44,960
Kara looked down at her father, dead in her arms.

777
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:50,080
Then she looked up at Einon and 
his knights on their horses.

778
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:55,120
'I hate that cruel man', she said quietly.

779
01:01:55,120 --> 01:01:57,720
'He killed my father.

780
01:01:57,720 --> 01:02:00,920
'I'll never forget that.

781
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:05,640
One day...'
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

782
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:07,280
CHAPTER EIGHT

783
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:11,120
Kara Meets Draco

784
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:15,400
At his castle, King Einon sat down to dinner.

785
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:18,640
His knights and their wives ate with him.

786
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:24,520
At the end of the table, his 
mother, Queen Aislinn, sat quietly.

787
01:02:24,520 --> 01:02:30,040
The other men and women at 
the table were loud and noisy.

788
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:33,200
Suddenly Einon turned round.

789
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:38,480
He saw somebody behind him 
with a knife in his hand.

790
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:43,480
The man threw the knife at 
the king, but he was ready.

791
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:48,360
Einon caught him and pushed 
him down on to the table.

792
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:55,560
Then Einon and Brok, the king's 
cruel knight, looked down at the man.

793
01:02:55,560 --> 01:03:04,040
But it wasn't a man! It was a woman! 
She had beautiful, long red hair.

794
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:06,840
It was Kara!

795
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:10,360
'I know you,' Einon said.

796
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:16,880
You're Redbeard's child.' Then 
he turned to Queen Aislinn.

797
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:22,640
'Look at her, Mother! She tried to kill me!

798
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:28,040
The queen looked at her son, 
but she didn't say a word.

799
01:03:28,040 --> 01:03:30,760
Einon looked at Kara.

800
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:34,760
'I killed your father, girl,' he said to her.

801
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:39,440
'And now I'm going to kill you.'

802
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:44,040
'Kill me then! I want to die,' shouted Kara.

803
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:46,480
'I don't want to live in this country.

804
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:49,960
You're not my king!'

805
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:58,200
'So what shall I do with you? I'll think 
of something,' Einon shouted at her.

806
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:01,840
'Now, take her away!'

807
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:07,360
Brok and some other knights 
quickly took Kara out of the room.

808
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:14,080
Einon looked down at her knife in his 
hands, and then he looked at his mother.

809
01:04:14,080 --> 01:04:18,440
The queen watched him but she said nothing.

810
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:24,320
Einon threw the knife down on the 
table and looked into the hot fire.

811
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:25,720
He thought for a minute.

812
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:31,520
Then he suddenly stood up and ran out of the room.

813
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:37,080
'Where is she? Where's that woman?' he shouted.

814
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:42,920
He found Kara in a small dark 
room in the bottom of the castle.

815
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:47,120
'I remember you now!' Einon shouted at her.

816
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:55,640
'Your red hair! At the battle! When my 
father, the king, died! It was your sword!  

817
01:04:56,320 --> 01:05:01,720
It went through my heart!' He opened his shirt.

818
01:05:01,720 --> 01:05:04,960
'Look! You did that.

819
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:10,200
Now I'll find a way to hurt you'

820
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:13,200
Kara looked into Einon's eyes.

821
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:15,560
She wasn't afraid.

822
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:20,040
'Next time I'll kill you!' she shouted at him.

823
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:21,680
'You can't.

824
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:24,360
I've got a different heart now.

825
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:28,480
It's very strong,' answered Einon.

826
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:32,560
'Your heart's black,' Kara shouted.

827
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:37,720
When he heard this, Einon 
looked at her with cruel eyes.

828
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:40,440
'You wait,' he said.

829
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:45,400
'I'll think of something...'

830
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:50,920
Kara sat in the cold room and 
looked out of the small window.

831
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:59,200
How could she get out? But then Queen 
Aislinn came quietly into the room.

832
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:01,920
'You!' Kara said.

833
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:04,080
'How did you get in here?'

834
01:06:04,080 --> 01:06:10,000
'Ssh! Be quiet! I want to 
help you,' said the queen.

835
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:16,640
'I don't want any help from the mother 
of that cruel king,' answered Kara.

836
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:21,360
'I am Einon's mother,' the queen said sadly.

837
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:23,760
'But he had a father too.

838
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:29,000
I had to marry King Freyne, but 
I didn't want to be his wife.

839
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:34,560
Einon's cruel because of his father, not me.'

840
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:39,720
'Why didn't you kill him when he 
was a baby then?' shouted Kara.

841
01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:44,240
'You can ask that now,' the queen answered.

842
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:50,640
'But when a mother looks at the baby 
in her arms, she only sees her child.

843
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:55,080
She doesn't know that he's 
going to be a cruel man.'

844
01:06:55,080 --> 01:06:58,800
'And now you want to help me,' Kara said.

845
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:00,000
'All right.

846
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,640
Give me my knife.

847
01:07:01,640 --> 01:07:04,000
Then I can die.'

848
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:10,400
'Don't die now, my girl, when 
you can live,' said the queen.

849
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:16,320
Then she showed Kara a small 
door behind the fireplace.

850
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:20,760
'Only three people know 
about this door,' she said.

851
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:25,520
She opened it and quickly walked 
outside the castle walls with Kara.

852
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:30,200
'Can you see that road?' the queen asked.

853
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:32,080
'Run away now.

854
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:35,200
Run fast!'

855
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:44,280
Kara turned to say thank you to 
Queen Aislinn, but she wasn't there!

856
01:07:44,280 --> 01:07:48,720
'What? Dogs!' shouted Einon angrily.

857
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:58,920
'Stupid men! Where's the girl? How did she get 
out?' Einon threw his food and drink on the floor.

858
01:07:58,920 --> 01:08:02,320
Brok and Queen Aislinn watched him.

859
01:08:02,320 --> 01:08:07,520
'Sir, there's only one way 
out of that room,' Brok said.

860
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:13,080
And only you, me and the queen know about it.'

861
01:08:13,080 --> 01:08:15,960
'I know!' shouted Einon.

862
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:24,360
'So how did the girl find the door?' 
His eyes turned to his mother.

863
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:27,320
'It was her,' he thought.

864
01:08:27,320 --> 01:08:30,080
'She helped her.'

865
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:33,800
He shouted at Brok, 'Get your best men.

866
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:34,720
Quickly.

867
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:36,440
Go and find her.

868
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:40,320
And bring her here fast.'

869
01:08:40,320 --> 01:08:45,960
Brok ran out, and the queen 
said quietly to her son,  

870
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:55,440
'I'll ask somebody to clean up this room.' Einon 
looked at his mother with cold, angry eyes.

871
01:08:56,800 --> 01:09:02,400
Kara ran away from the 
castle as fast as she could.

872
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:07,680
When she arrived at her village, 
she told everybody her story.

873
01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:10,920
'I've got a plan to kill the king.

874
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:14,800
Will you help me?' she asked the villagers.

875
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:16,720
But they were afraid.

876
01:09:16,720 --> 01:09:19,880
They didn't want to hear her ideas.

877
01:09:19,880 --> 01:09:22,920
Her father, Redbeard, was dead.

878
01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:25,760
They didn't want to die too.

879
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:30,440
'Listen to me! We have to fight!' said Kara.

880
01:09:30,440 --> 01:09:34,720
But the men shouted at her and started to hit her.

881
01:09:34,720 --> 01:09:38,840
'Stop that!' somebody behind them said.

882
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:43,960
They turned and saw Sir Bowen on his horse.

883
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:55,320
Then suddenly one of the men cried, 'Look! Look up 
there!' It was Draco, the dragon, high in the sky!

884
01:09:57,440 --> 01:10:02,640
'You're late!' thought Bowen, 
when he saw the dragon.

885
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:06,320
Draco flew down near the village.

886
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:09,880
'Look at that fire!' the men shouted.

887
01:10:09,880 --> 01:10:18,080
'It's coming out of his nose! He's going to 
burn our village!' Some of the villagers ran  

888
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:25,720
away into their houses, but Kara and the 
oldest man in the village stayed behind.

889
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:30,120
'Do you want me to kill this 
dragon?' Bowen asked them.

890
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:34,920
'You'll have to pay me, or I'll leave him here!'

891
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:38,040
Kara looked very angry.

892
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:40,760
'I thought King Einon was cruel.

893
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:45,080
But this knight is worse,' 
she said to the old man.

894
01:10:45,080 --> 01:10:48,800
'Don't give him our money.'

895
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:54,400
Bowen looked hard at Kara and 
said to the old man, 'All right.

896
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:56,640
Don't give me any money.

897
01:10:56,640 --> 01:11:06,080
But why don't you give the dragon one of the 
village's lovely young women? Then he'll go away.'

898
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:10,400
The other men came out of their 
houses and listened to Bowen.

899
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:14,080
Then they all looked at Kara.

900
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:19,760
'Yes, give her to the dragon,' they shouted.

901
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:24,640
'Who's that girl?' asked Draco.

902
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:27,080
'The villagers want you to have her.

903
01:11:27,080 --> 01:11:32,600
Then you'll go away,' answered Bowen.

904
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:39,240
'That's stupid! Who gave them 
that idea?' Draco laughed.

905
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:43,120
'I don't know,' Bowen said quietly.

906
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:46,680
'What are you waiting for? Quickly.

907
01:11:46,680 --> 01:11:48,840
Go and eat her!'

908
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:52,800
'Oh, please!' said Draco.

909
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:55,040
'I feel ill.

910
01:11:55,040 --> 01:11:55,240
Yech!'

911
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:59,000
'But you ate Sir Eglamore.

912
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:02,920
I saw him when I was in your mouth,' said Bowen.

913
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:04,760
'Think of something.

914
01:12:04,760 --> 01:12:07,040
Quickly!'

915
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:12,920
Draco put out his arms and pulled 
Kara away from the men in the village.

916
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:17,320
Then he flew away with her into the sky.

917
01:12:17,320 --> 01:12:20,280
Everybody shouted and laughed.

918
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:23,240
They were very happy.

919
01:12:23,240 --> 01:12:24,680
'Thank you, Knight.

920
01:12:24,680 --> 01:12:25,160
Thank you.

921
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:32,160
Now we'll never see Kara or the 
dragon again!'
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

922
01:12:32,160 --> 01:12:33,680
CHAPTER NINE

923
01:12:33,680 --> 01:12:37,000
Ready for Battle

924
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:44,560
'That's lovely, Draco.' Kara sat in 
the hot sun with a smile on her face.

925
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:50,760
Draco sat next to her and 
sang his sad, strange song.

926
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:53,120
'And you're a lovely dragon.

927
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:57,360
They're not all as kind as you are,' said Kara.

928
01:12:57,360 --> 01:13:01,160
She felt warm and happy.

929
01:13:01,160 --> 01:13:06,440
'How many dragons do you know then?' Draco asked.

930
01:13:06,440 --> 01:13:09,640
'You're the first,' answered Kara.

931
01:13:09,640 --> 01:13:11,360
'But you're funny.

932
01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:18,880
You don't eat young women - you sing 
to them! Do you do anything dangerous?'

933
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:22,000
'No,' said Draco.

934
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:28,080
'When people are kind to me, I never hurt them.'

935
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:33,360
'Then why did you come to my village?' asked Kara.

936
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:36,840
'Good question!' said somebody behind them.

937
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:38,760
It was Bowen.

938
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:41,720
'You remember Kara's village, Draco.

939
01:13:41,720 --> 01:13:44,440
Why did you go there?'

940
01:13:44,440 --> 01:13:47,520
Kara looked angrily at Bowen.

941
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:50,280
'Go away, Knight,' she shouted.

942
01:13:50,280 --> 01:13:53,720
'You wanted this dragon to eat me!'

943
01:13:53,720 --> 01:13:58,360
Then she got up and tried to fight Bowen.

944
01:13:58,360 --> 01:14:07,280
They fell into the river and Bowen shouted 
out, 'Help! Draco, why didn't you eat her?'

945
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:13,840
Draco smiled and answered, 
'Kara, this is Sir Bowen.

946
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:15,760
He won't hurt you.

947
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:19,920
Bowen meet Kara.'

948
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:24,640
Kara and Bowen stopped fighting 
and got out of the river.

949
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:29,880
But before they could say anything, 
they heard the sound of horses.

950
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:34,960
Draco heard them too and 
quickly jumped into the water.

951
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:40,400
Einon, Brok and the king's other 
knights came out of the trees.

952
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:45,920
Bowen ran in front of Kara - 
he didn't want them to see her.

953
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:51,280
Kara looked at Bowen and 
suddenly remembered his face.

954
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:54,800
'He helped my father,' she thought.

955
01:14:54,800 --> 01:15:01,880
'When I was younger and Einon tried 
to burn out his eyes the first time.

956
01:15:01,880 --> 01:15:06,240
He was a good Knight of the Old Code then.

957
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:12,360
Why is he different now?' But she 
didn't have time to think about that.

958
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:15,240
Einon sat above her on his horse.

959
01:15:15,240 --> 01:15:18,920
He looked down at the girl and the knight.

960
01:15:18,920 --> 01:15:25,320
'Ah, my old teacher!' he said cruelly.

961
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:29,000
And you've got my woman.

962
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:30,560
I lost her.

963
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:34,120
But here she is!'

964
01:15:34,120 --> 01:15:37,800
'I don't think she's your woman, King Einon.

965
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:41,920
She doesn't want to come 
with you,' answered Bowen.

966
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:46,040
'Oh, I'm sorry, but I'm not asking her.

967
01:15:46,040 --> 01:15:47,720
I'm telling her.

968
01:15:47,720 --> 01:15:52,200
She has to come,' shouted Einon.

969
01:15:52,200 --> 01:15:59,920
'My sword says she doesn't have to,' 
said Bowen, and he pulled out his sword.

970
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:04,640
Einon smiled and pulled out his sword too.

971
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:09,600
Then the teacher and his student started to fight.

972
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:13,760
They fell down but quickly 
stood up again in the river.

973
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:18,040
They looked strong and dangerous 
with their swords in their hands.

974
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:21,600
But Einon was younger and faster.

975
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:24,480
'Fight me, Bowen', he called.

976
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:27,360
'You're a knight of the Old Code.

977
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:31,520
But nobody remembers the Old Code now.

978
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:34,200
You're dead!'

979
01:16:34,200 --> 01:16:36,960
His words made Bowen angrier.

980
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:44,120
'You remember the Old Code! It's 
your Code too, you know,' he shouted.

981
01:16:44,120 --> 01:16:49,520
'Never! It was never my Code,' Einon shouted back.

982
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:51,600
'Yes, it was.

983
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:58,840
You repeated the words of the Old Code to 
the dragon in the mountain,' said Bowen.

984
01:16:58,840 --> 01:17:04,440
'I only said those words because you 
wanted to hear them,' laughed Einon.

985
01:17:04,440 --> 01:17:06,960
'And I wanted to live.

986
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:13,520
You taught me to fight and you 
taught me well, Old Knight!'

987
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:18,960
Then Einon brought his sword 
down hard on Bowen's arm.

988
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:22,520
The knight fell down in the water.

989
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:29,400
But before Einon could kill Bowen, Draco 
came out of the river opposite him.

990
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:37,320
The Great Dragon stood above the king and 
looked down at him with his angry, yellow eyes.

991
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:45,640
Then Draco put up his arms, and 
Einon saw the red light on his heart.

992
01:17:45,640 --> 01:17:48,600
The king felt very afraid.

993
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:53,360
He climbed out of the river 
fast and jumped on to his horse.

994
01:17:53,360 --> 01:18:01,400
Kara, Bowen and Draco watched 
him, and Einon rode away.

995
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:04,680
Kara helped Bowen out of the river.

996
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:08,880
She sat near him on the ground and washed his arm.

997
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:12,640
'You're a very strong fighter,' she said.

998
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:17,960
'Will you help the men in my village 
to fight Einon and his knights?'

999
01:18:17,960 --> 01:18:20,880
'You won't win,' said Bowen.

1000
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:23,200
'Einon will kill you.'

1001
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:27,280
Kara looked at him angrily, then stood up.

1002
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:32,440
'Will you fight with us, 
Draco?' she asked the dragon.

1003
01:18:32,440 --> 01:18:35,640
Draco looked at her sadly.

1004
01:18:35,640 --> 01:18:40,520
'For thousands of years dragons helped people.

1005
01:18:40,520 --> 01:18:45,680
There was one dragon - the 
greatest dragon in the world.

1006
01:18:45,680 --> 01:18:50,920
He told the other dragons to 
help the people in this country.

1007
01:18:50,920 --> 01:19:00,320
Can you see that star up there? When 
the old dragon died that star was born.

1008
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:08,880
And after that, when other dragons died, 
new stars were born in the night sky.

1009
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:13,520
But then men stopped listening to the dragons.

1010
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:19,920
I wanted to do one wonderful thing 
for the people in this country.

1011
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:24,520
I wanted to be a star in the sky too.

1012
01:19:24,520 --> 01:19:27,680
But I made a bad mistake.

1013
01:19:27,680 --> 01:19:33,600
I helped to make the world a worse place.'

1014
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:38,280
Bowen listened to the dragon's sad words.

1015
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:42,720
'It was you!' he suddenly shouted.

1016
01:19:42,720 --> 01:19:45,480
'You're the dragon in the mountain.

1017
01:19:45,480 --> 01:19:50,680
King Einon has half your heart!'

1018
01:19:50,680 --> 01:19:54,760
'Yes,' said Draco quietly.

1019
01:19:54,760 --> 01:19:59,560
Einon will only die when I die.

1020
01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:02,520
He's got half my heart.

1021
01:20:02,520 --> 01:20:04,760
I wanted to help him.

1022
01:20:04,760 --> 01:20:07,720
I wanted him to be good.

1023
01:20:07,720 --> 01:20:11,720
But my heart didn't change him.

1024
01:20:11,720 --> 01:20:14,360
I was stupid!'

1025
01:20:14,360 --> 01:20:18,400
'No you weren't,' said Bowen kindly.

1026
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:21,040
'I wanted to help Einon too.

1027
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:24,080
I wanted to teach him the Old Code.

1028
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:24,640
But I couldn't.'

1029
01:20:26,520 --> 01:20:30,160
Then Draco turned to Kara.

1030
01:20:30,160 --> 01:20:35,640
'Yes, I'll fight Einon with you Kara,' he said.

1031
01:20:35,640 --> 01:20:38,200
'I'd like to help you.

1032
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:40,960
Come with us, Bowen.'

1033
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:43,520
The knight thought for a minute.

1034
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:50,840
Then he stood up, and they all started 
to walk back to Kara's village.

1035
01:20:50,840 --> 01:20:54,640
When they arrived there, Kara 
asked the villagers to help her.

1036
01:20:55,680 --> 01:20:59,520
She wanted them to fight Einon and kill him.

1037
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:02,320
But the men were angry and afraid.

1038
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:06,440
They shouted at her and began to hit her again.

1039
01:21:06,440 --> 01:21:15,800
Suddenly somebody said, 'Well, I'm going 
to fight Einon.' The men looked round.

1040
01:21:15,800 --> 01:21:21,120
There, on his horse in the 
morning sun, was Sir Bowen.

1041
01:21:21,120 --> 01:21:26,800
He had fire in his eyes and a smile on his face.

1042
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:31,160
'Only you, Knight?' shouted the men.

1043
01:21:31,160 --> 01:21:35,000
'And Draco,' said Bowen.

1044
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:39,920
From behind a bridge, Draco 
flew down to the village.

1045
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:44,440
The men looked at Bowen and then at Draco.

1046
01:21:44,440 --> 01:21:48,560
One of them shouted, 'I'm going to fight too.

1047
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:53,240
I want to fight Einon with 
this knight and the dragon.'

1048
01:21:53,240 --> 01:21:54,520
The other villagers listened  

1049
01:21:55,040 --> 01:22:07,560
and then they started to shout too, 'Kill 
Einon! Kill the cruel king! We want to fight!'

1050
01:22:07,560 --> 01:22:12,720
For weeks, everybody in the 
village got ready for the battle.

1051
01:22:12,720 --> 01:22:19,320
On the last night, the villagers 
gave Bowen a beautiful new sword.

1052
01:22:19,320 --> 01:22:21,880
It shone in the firelight.

1053
01:22:21,880 --> 01:22:28,960
On it was a picture of Draco 
- the dragon looked wonderful.

1054
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:31,520
Bowen couldn't say anything.

1055
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:37,200
He stood in the middle of the village 
and looked at the men round him.

1056
01:22:37,200 --> 01:22:45,840
Then he looked at Draco and Kara and 
saw the love in his friends' eyes.

1057
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:51,000
'You're ready for battle 
tomorrow,' he said to everybody.

1058
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:54,440
'And you're ready to win.

1059
01:22:55,200 --> 01:22:58,640
To win back your country.

1060
01:22:58,640 --> 01:23:07,160
And the greatest dragon in the world 
is going to help you!
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

1061
01:23:07,160 --> 01:23:08,840
CHAPTER TEN

1062
01:23:08,840 --> 01:23:13,440
A New Star in the Sky

1063
01:23:13,440 --> 01:23:16,680
It was the day of the great battle.

1064
01:23:16,680 --> 01:23:21,680
King Einon and his knights 
looked out of the castle windows.

1065
01:23:21,680 --> 01:23:26,440
'There are hundreds of peasants 
down there!' called Brok.

1066
01:23:26,440 --> 01:23:29,120
'They're ready to fight!'

1067
01:23:29,120 --> 01:23:32,680
'Then let's go!' answered Sir Felton.

1068
01:23:32,680 --> 01:23:36,560
'One of us is as strong as a hundred of them!'

1069
01:23:36,560 --> 01:23:40,200
'Don't be stupid!' Einon shouted at him.

1070
01:23:40,200 --> 01:23:42,560
'They've got Sir Bowen with them.

1071
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:45,680
And the dragon.'

1072
01:23:45,680 --> 01:23:48,880
Queen Aislinn came into the room.

1073
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:54,680
'Don't be afraid of the dragon, my 
son,' she said quietly to Einon.

1074
01:23:54,680 --> 01:23:56,800
Einon turned to her.

1075
01:23:56,800 --> 01:24:00,280
'I'm not afraid of anything!' he said.

1076
01:24:00,280 --> 01:24:03,600
'But it's strange, you know, mother.

1077
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:09,360
Sometimes the dragon feels very near me.'

1078
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:14,880
'Come with me, son,' said the 
queen, and walked out of the room.

1079
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:21,440
Einon followed and saw five 
great, strong knights outside.

1080
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:24,680
'These men are for you, my son.

1081
01:24:24,680 --> 01:24:29,840
They're the strongest in 
the world,' the queen said.

1082
01:24:29,840 --> 01:24:34,200
'The strongest what?' Einon asked.

1083
01:24:34,200 --> 01:24:39,840
'The strongest dragon 
killers,' answered his mother.

1084
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:42,760
Einon took his mother's hand.

1085
01:24:42,760 --> 01:24:48,360
He looked into her eyes and thanked her warmly.

1086
01:24:48,360 --> 01:24:51,440
The king then went back to his knights.

1087
01:24:51,440 --> 01:24:54,320
Below them, they could see Bowen and the peasants.

1088
01:24:55,760 --> 01:24:59,560
'Look at them!' shouted Einon angrily.

1089
01:24:59,560 --> 01:25:11,400
'They're at my castle walls! Well, today Bowen's 
going to die and the Old Code will die with him!'

1090
01:25:11,400 --> 01:25:17,320
Bowen rode up and down outside the 
castle, and looked up at Einon.

1091
01:25:17,320 --> 01:25:21,640
'Come down and fight,' he shouted.

1092
01:25:21,640 --> 01:25:24,320
Einon heard him and felt very angry.

1093
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:30,600
Suddenly Draco flew down into the castle.

1094
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:36,480
The fire from the dragon's nose 
burnt the king's buildings and men.

1095
01:25:36,480 --> 01:25:42,000
Einon watched and shouted, 'We 
can't stay here! We'll all burn.

1096
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:47,680
Let's go outside and fight those stupid peasants!'

1097
01:25:47,680 --> 01:25:51,480
He and his knights quickly ran down the stairs.

1098
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:55,760
They jumped on their horses 
and rode out of the castle.

1099
01:25:55,760 --> 01:26:01,480
Einon, on his great white horse, 
pulled out his father's sword.

1100
01:26:01,480 --> 01:26:07,320
'Right! Let's kill them,' he shouted to his men.

1101
01:26:07,320 --> 01:26:13,600
Bowen saw Einon and shouted to the 
peasants, 'Quickly! Run! Run into  

1102
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:22,160
the trees!' Einon and his knights followed 
the peasants but Bowen rode away from them.

1103
01:26:22,160 --> 01:26:27,200
The king and his men looked 
for the peasants in the trees.

1104
01:26:27,200 --> 01:26:33,720
They didn't know that Bowen and hundreds 
of other peasants were behind them.

1105
01:26:33,720 --> 01:26:41,120
Suddenly Bowen shouted out, 'Now!', 
and the peasants began to fight.

1106
01:26:41,120 --> 01:26:46,320
They threw burning wood down on 
to Einon's men from behind them.

1107
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:52,160
Then hundreds of peasants came out 
of the trees in front of them too.

1108
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:58,080
'Quickly! Back to the castle, 
or we'll die!' shouted Einon.

1109
01:26:58,080 --> 01:27:02,920
He rode through the fire on 
his horse and his men followed.

1110
01:27:02,920 --> 01:27:05,520
Bowen was near the king.

1111
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:10,040
He pulled out his sword and 
jumped on to Einon's horse.

1112
01:27:10,040 --> 01:27:15,720
Then he pushed the sword through Einon's heart.

1113
01:27:15,720 --> 01:27:18,280
But the king didn't stop.

1114
01:27:18,280 --> 01:27:21,720
He didn't feel the sword!

1115
01:27:21,720 --> 01:27:28,120
At the same time, Draco suddenly 
fell from the sky into the castle.

1116
01:27:28,120 --> 01:27:37,320
Bowen watched and shouted, 'No! Draco!' 
He thought about the dragon's words:  

1117
01:27:37,320 --> 01:27:43,200
Einon will only die when I'll die.'

1118
01:27:43,200 --> 01:27:51,240
He turned to Kara and said, 'Einon didn't 
feel my sword in his heart, but Draco felt it.

1119
01:27:51,240 --> 01:27:59,400
Quickly! Let's go and help him.' 
Then he and Kara rode to the castle.

1120
01:27:59,400 --> 01:28:03,640
Einon also watched Draco fall from the sky.

1121
01:28:03,640 --> 01:28:10,680
He saw his five dragon killers jump on 
to the dragon and pull out their swords.

1122
01:28:10,680 --> 01:28:12,920
'Stop,' he shouted.

1123
01:28:12,920 --> 01:28:14,360
'Don't kill him.

1124
01:28:14,360 --> 01:28:17,120
I don't want the dragon to die.

1125
01:28:17,120 --> 01:28:19,000
I want him to live.

1126
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,880
Then I'll never die.'

1127
01:28:21,880 --> 01:28:25,200
'No! 'Draco cried.

1128
01:28:25,200 --> 01:28:29,840
'Kill me! Please!'

1129
01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:34,880
From a window in the castle, the 
queen looked down at the dragon.

1130
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:36,960
She wanted to help him.

1131
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:41,760
She ran down the stairs with a knife in her hands.

1132
01:28:41,760 --> 01:28:47,960
'Come here, Aislinn,' Draco said, when he saw her.

1133
01:28:47,960 --> 01:28:52,280
'I've come to help you, Draco,' she said sadly.

1134
01:28:52,280 --> 01:28:54,040
'I've got a knife.

1135
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:57,480
I'm going to kill you.'

1136
01:28:57,480 --> 01:29:01,600
'I know,' said Draco.

1137
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:04,040
'You have to kill me.

1138
01:29:04,040 --> 01:29:08,280
Then cruel Einon will die.

1139
01:29:08,280 --> 01:29:15,920
Are the stars shining in 
the sky tonight, Aislinn?'

1140
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:17,920
'Yes, Great Dragon.

1141
01:29:17,920 --> 01:29:22,320
They're beautiful,' answered the queen.

1142
01:29:22,320 --> 01:29:28,840
'Then kill me now,' said Draco.

1143
01:29:28,840 --> 01:29:36,360
But before the queen could do anything, 
somebody pulled the knife out of her hands.

1144
01:29:36,360 --> 01:29:38,960
It was Einon.

1145
01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:45,280
'So, mother, you gave me the five dragon killers  

1146
01:29:45,280 --> 01:29:51,520
because you wanted them to kill 
this dragon,' he shouted angrily.

1147
01:29:51,520 --> 01:29:54,080
You wanted him to die.

1148
01:29:54,080 --> 01:29:58,000
And you wanted me to die too!'

1149
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,040
'Yes, son.

1150
01:30:00,040 --> 01:30:03,480
I made a mistake when you were a child.

1151
01:30:03,480 --> 01:30:07,000
I asked the Great Dragon to help you.

1152
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:11,720
But now you're king, you're 
as cruel as your father.

1153
01:30:11,720 --> 01:30:15,280
You have to die.'

1154
01:30:15,280 --> 01:30:19,080
Draco listened to the words of mother and son.

1155
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:21,160
He couldn't stop Einon.

1156
01:30:21,160 --> 01:30:24,160
And he couldn't help the queen.

1157
01:30:24,160 --> 01:30:30,400
Bowen and Kara ran quickly into 
the castle and found Draco.

1158
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:35,560
'Don't try to help me,' said the dragon.

1159
01:30:35,560 --> 01:30:39,960
'I'm tired and I want to die.

1160
01:30:39,960 --> 01:30:43,720
Then Einon will die too.'

1161
01:30:43,720 --> 01:30:48,920
'But we won the battle!' shouted Bowen.

1162
01:30:48,920 --> 01:30:53,520
'You'll never win,' answered Draco.

1163
01:30:53,520 --> 01:31:00,000
'Kill me! Then you'll kill cruel King Einon.

1164
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:03,400
Then you'll win.'

1165
01:31:03,400 --> 01:31:07,480
'No, I can't,' cried Bowen.

1166
01:31:07,480 --> 01:31:10,960
'I can't kill you, dear Draco.

1167
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:15,120
You're the last dragon in the world.'

1168
01:31:15,120 --> 01:31:22,920
'This is the end for me, 
Bowen! Kill me!' said Draco.

1169
01:31:22,920 --> 01:31:27,000
'But you're my friend,' Bowen said.

1170
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:33,000
'So kill me!' Draco shouted.

1171
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:38,200
Suddenly Einon arrived and 
Bowen pulled out his sword.

1172
01:31:38,200 --> 01:31:46,160
He tried to push the sword into the cruel 
king's heart, but Einon moved away quickly.

1173
01:31:46,160 --> 01:31:56,160
By mistake, Bowen's sword flew into Draco's 
heart! Bowen ran to the dragon and pulled it out.

1174
01:31:56,160 --> 01:32:01,640
Then he turned and pushed it into Einon's heart.

1175
01:32:01,640 --> 01:32:06,120
The king fell to the ground next to Draco.

1176
01:32:06,120 --> 01:32:15,200
His eyes closed - cruel King Einon was dead.

1177
01:32:15,200 --> 01:32:19,920
Draco looked at Bowen and smiled warmly.

1178
01:32:19,920 --> 01:32:23,560
Then he closed his eyes.

1179
01:32:23,560 --> 01:32:27,960
Bowen went down on the ground near his friend.

1180
01:32:27,960 --> 01:32:35,080
'Are you going to leave us now, 
Draco? What will we do without you?'

1181
01:32:35,080 --> 01:32:42,800
Draco answered, 'I'm going 
up to the stars, dear Bowen.

1182
01:32:42,800 --> 01:32:53,840
To my old dragon friends in the stars.'

1183
01:32:55,080 --> 01:33:01,520
In front of their eyes, the 
dragon changed to starlight.

1184
01:33:01,520 --> 01:33:11,680
Then Bowen and Kara watched the dragon's light 
fly up into the sky, to the other dragon stars.

1185
01:33:11,680 --> 01:33:20,920
For a minute, they couldn't see him, but 
suddenly they saw a new star in the sky.

1186
01:33:20,920 --> 01:33:23,840
It was Draco!

1187
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:27,120
'Look, Kara!' said Bowen.

1188
01:33:27,120 --> 01:33:29,720
'Look at Draco now.

1189
01:33:29,720 --> 01:33:38,440
He's the biggest and most 
beautiful star in the sky!'
