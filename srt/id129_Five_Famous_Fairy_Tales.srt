CHAPTER ONE
The Table, the Donkey and the Stick

2
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:14,799
Once there was a woman with three sons - Tom,
Bob and Jack.

3
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:17,039
Tom was the youngest.

4
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,619
Bob came next, and Jack was the oldest.

5
00:00:21,619 --> 00:00:23,689
They lived in a village.

6
00:00:23,689 --> 00:00:28,029
They were happy, but their mother was very
poor.

7
00:00:28,029 --> 00:00:32,570
So the boys looked for work.

8
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:37,160
Tom worked for a kind man in the next town.

9
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:42,280
The man made tables and other things from
wood.

10
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:46,160
Tom worked very hard for one year.

11
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:52,110
When the year ended, the kind man gave him
a table.

12
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:57,850
It looked old and dirty, but it was a magic
table.

13
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:04,580
'Say to the table, "I am hungry."

14
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:14,730
Then wonderful food will appear on it by magic,'
said the man, with a smile.

15
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:19,730
'You are very kind,' said Tom to the man.

16
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:22,190
And he left.

17
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:30,530
He went from country to country and from city
to city, and he was always happy.

18
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:34,380
He carried his table on his back.

19
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:43,970
When he wanted food, he put the table down
- in the street, by a river, under a tree.

20
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:53,020
He said to the table, 'I am hungry', and lovely
food appeared.

21
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:59,700
Some months later, he thought, 'I would like
to see my mother.

22
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,479
I'll go home.'

23
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:08,209
On the last night of his journey to his mother's
house, he came to an old house.

24
00:02:08,209 --> 00:02:12,110
An old man lived there.

25
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:16,980
'Can I stay the night here?' he asked the
old man.

26
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:27,349
'Yes, you can stay here, but I can't give
you any food,' said the old man.

27
00:02:27,349 --> 00:02:30,430
'Don't give me any food,' Tom said.

28
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:33,849
'You can eat with me.'

29
00:02:33,849 --> 00:02:41,360
Then he put down his table and said, 'I am
hungry.'

30
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,040
Wonderful food appeared and they ate it.

31
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:49,739
Now this man was not a good man.

32
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:52,230
He was a jealous man.

33
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:56,959
'I want this boy's table,' he thought.

34
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,090
'It will give me food.

35
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:04,209
I can sell the food to other people.

36
00:03:04,209 --> 00:03:09,779
I will never be hungry again.'

37
00:03:09,779 --> 00:03:17,650
When Tom was asleep that night, the old man
took the magic table from Tom's room.

38
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:22,769
He worked all night and made a new table.

39
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:25,150
It looked the same.

40
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:29,579
He put it next to Tom's bed.

41
00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:37,739
The next morning Tom put the new table on
his back and he walked to his mother's house.

42
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:43,930
Tom's mother was very happy when she saw her
youngest son.

43
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:47,439
'What did you do when you were away?'

44
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:48,810
she asked.

45
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:52,549
'I made tables,' said Tom.

46
00:03:52,549 --> 00:03:56,620
'And I have a table here.'

47
00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:01,049
'It's not a very nice table,' said his mother.

48
00:04:01,049 --> 00:04:05,189
'But it's a magic table,' answered Tom.

49
00:04:05,189 --> 00:04:13,629
'When I say to it, "I am hungry", beautiful
food appears on it.'

50
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:17,590
'Show me!' said his mother.

51
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:21,840
'Let's invite our friends from the village.

52
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:27,860
Then everybody can see the magic,' said Tom.

53
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:32,340
Tom's mother invited everybody from the village.

54
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:40,110
Tom put his table down in front of them and
said, 'I am hungry.'

55
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:42,850
But nothing happened.

56
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:47,210
No wonderful food appeared on the table.

57
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:50,930
Everybody laughed and went away.

58
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:53,410
Tom was very angry.

59
00:04:53,410 --> 00:05:00,950
He knew now - the old man had his magic table.

60
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:03,470
Tom was very unhappy.

61
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:08,630
He ran away from home and went back to his
old job.

62
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:11,710
He wrote to his brother, Jack.

63
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:18,199
His letter told the story of the magic table
and the jealous old man.

64
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:27,880
Bob, the second brother, worked with a friendly
man in a village many kilometres away.

65
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:31,900
Bob worked very hard for one year.

66
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:38,629
When the year ended, the man gave Bob a donkey.

67
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:47,030
'You can't sit on this donkey,' the man said,
'but it is a good donkey.'

68
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:49,250
'It's very small.

69
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:52,840
Why is it a good donkey?' asked Bob.

70
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:58,439
'Because it's a magic donkey,' answered the
man.

71
00:05:58,439 --> 00:06:02,060
'Put a box under its mouth.

72
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:10,189
Say the magic word, "Bricklebat", and gold
will suddenly fall from its mouth.

73
00:06:10,189 --> 00:06:12,170
Catch the gold in the box.

74
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:16,879
You will never be poor.'

75
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:22,699
'You are very kind,' Bob said to the man.

76
00:06:22,699 --> 00:06:30,930
Bob went from country to country, and from
city to city, and he was always happy.

77
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:33,699
He took the donkey with him.

78
00:06:33,699 --> 00:06:40,229
He bought the most expensive clothes and ate
the most wonderful food.

79
00:06:40,229 --> 00:06:43,580
He stayed in the best houses.

80
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:50,909
When he wanted more money, he said 'Bricklebat'
to the donkey.

81
00:06:50,909 --> 00:06:57,100
Some months later, Bob thought, 'I would like
to see my mother.

82
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:02,030
I'll go home.'

83
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:07,340
On the last night of his journey, he came
to the old house.

84
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:11,190
The jealous old man was there.

85
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:15,340
'Can I stay the night here?' he asked.

86
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:24,639
'Yes, you can stay here, but I want money
for your food and your bed.'

87
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:25,710
'Money!'

88
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:27,300
cried Bob.

89
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:30,120
'You can have a lot of money!'

90
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:35,169
Bob ate lovely food at Tom's table.

91
00:07:35,169 --> 00:07:38,570
The old man asked for some money.

92
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:42,949
Bob put his hand in his coat but there was
nothing in it.

93
00:07:42,949 --> 00:07:48,580
'Wait,' said Bob, 'I'll get some.'

94
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:53,509
He took a box and went outside to the donkey.

95
00:07:53,509 --> 00:07:57,280
The old man followed him to the door.

96
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,490
He stood behind the door and Bob did not see
him.

97
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:04,680
'Where is his money?'

98
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,219
the old man thought.

99
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:08,500
'I'll watch him.

100
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:14,349
When he's asleep, I'll take his money.'

101
00:08:14,349 --> 00:08:17,710
Bob put the box under the donkey's mouth.

102
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:19,960
He said the magic word.

103
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,710
The gold fell into the box.

104
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:27,949
The old man's mouth opened wider and wider.

105
00:08:27,949 --> 00:08:31,319
'I want that donkey,' he thought.

106
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:39,950
Later that night, when Bob was asleep, the
old man went outside.

107
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:46,020
He found another donkey and put it in the
place of the magic donkey.

108
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:53,290
The next morning, Bob took the new donkey
and walked to his mother's house.

109
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:57,960
Bob's mother was very happy when she saw her
son.

110
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,920
'What did you do when you were away?'

111
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,270
she asked.

112
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:05,440
'I worked for a man,' said Bob.

113
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,440
'And he gave me this donkey.'

114
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:13,180
'It's a very small donkey,' said his mother.

115
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:15,730
'Is it strong?'

116
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:21,140
'No,' answered Bob, 'but it's a magic donkey.

117
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:26,180
When I say the magic word, gold falls from
its mouth.

118
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:28,590
Call your friends.

119
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:31,190
Let's show them.'

120
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:33,420
Everybody came from the village.

121
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:38,330
'Now, watch this!' said Bob.

122
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:40,710
'Bricklebat!

123
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:43,100
'Everybody looked at the donkey.

124
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,730
The donkey looked at them.

125
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:46,730
Nothing happened.

126
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:50,960
No gold fell from its mouth.

127
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:55,450
Everybody laughed, and Bob was very angry.

128
00:09:55,450 --> 00:10:02,200
He knew now - the old man had his magic donkey.

129
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:06,080
He ran away from home and went back to his
old job.

130
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,720
He wrote to his brother, Jack.

131
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:18,160
His letter told the story of the magic donkey
and the jealous old man.

132
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,690
Jack worked with a wood-cutter.

133
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:24,520
He worked very hard for one year.

134
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:30,210
When the year ended, the wood-cutter gave
Jack a beautiful box.

135
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:32,540
There was a stick inside it.

136
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:40,080
'Thank you for the beautiful box,' said Jack,
'but I don't want the stick.

137
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:44,030
I'll put something prettier than a stick in
this lovely box.'

138
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:49,630
'It's a magic stick,' said the wood-cutter.

139
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:55,790
'When somebody is unkind to you, the stick
will help you.

140
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:57,070
You say, "Stick!

141
00:10:57,070 --> 00:11:00,320
Out of the box!''

142
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:05,540
The stick will jump out of the box and it
will hit them.

143
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,860
When you say, "Stick!

144
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:13,750
Back in the box!", it will stop hitting them.'

145
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:18,240
Jack took the box and started his journey
home.

146
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,950
On the last night of his journey, he came
to the old house.

147
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:26,300
The jealous old man was there.

148
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:29,050
He gave Jack some food.

149
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:31,770
Then Jack told him about his journey.

150
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:38,550
'Do you know,' said Jack, 'that there is a
magic table?

151
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:42,870
You say "I am hungry" to the table.

152
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:46,450
Then wonderful food appears on it.

153
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:48,700
And there is a magic donkey.

154
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:51,010
You say "Bricklebat!"

155
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:55,880
to it, and gold falls from its mouth.

156
00:11:55,880 --> 00:12:03,330
But I have something better than the magic
table or the magic donkey in this box.

157
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:06,290
Nothing in the world is as good as this!'

158
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:09,380
'What is it?'

159
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:11,760
thought the jealous old man.

160
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,730
'I want it.'

161
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:19,350
When Jack went to bed, he put the box on the
floor.

162
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:21,930
He shut his eyes.

163
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:26,640
After some time, the old man came into Jack's
room.

164
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,830
He looked at Jack.

165
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:32,690
Quietly he put his hand on the box.

166
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:35,720
Suddenly, Jack jumped out of bed.

167
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,720
'Stick!

168
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,060
Out of the box!' he cried.

169
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:45,490
The stick hit the jealous old man on his head
and arms and back.

170
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:49,110
The old man wanted to run away but he couldn't.

171
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:54,230
'Give me the magic table and the magic donkey.

172
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:58,240
Then I will put the stick back in the box,'
said Jack.

173
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,850
'Yes, yes,' cried the old man.

174
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:03,380
'You can have them.

175
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:04,510
Stop the stick!

176
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:07,290
Stop the stick!'

177
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:14,300
The next day, Jack took the table, the donkey
and the stick and he walked to his mother's

178
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,300
house.

179
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:20,360
Jack's mother was very happy when she saw
her son.

180
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,930
'What did you do when you were away?'

181
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:23,950
she asked.

182
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:28,070
'I worked with a wood-cutter,' said Jack.'

183
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:30,290
He gave me this stick.'

184
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:32,190
'A stick!'

185
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:33,740
cried his mother angrily.

186
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:36,690
'Why did he give you a stick?

187
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:40,770
You can get a stick from every tree in the
world!'

188
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:43,890
'Yes,' said Jack.

189
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:47,630
'But this is a magic stick.

190
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:51,030
When somebody is unkind to me, I say, "Stick!

191
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,970
Out of the box!"

192
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:56,520
It jumps out of the box and hits them.

193
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:59,330
It only stops when I say, "Stick!

194
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:01,400
Back in the box!"

195
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:06,500
My brothers had a magic table and a magic
donkey.

196
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:10,190
A jealous old man took them.

197
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:13,190
With this stick, I got them back again.'

198
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:18,670
Jack's mother was very happy.

199
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:22,940
She wrote to Tom and Bob and told them the
story.

200
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:24,560
They came home.

201
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,990
She invited everybody from the village to
their house.

202
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:34,240
Everybody sat round the magic table and ate
wonderful food.

203
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:39,720
Everybody took home a bag of gold from the
magic donkey's mouth.

204
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:46,600
From that day, the old woman and her three
sons lived very happily.

205
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:54,170
CHAPTER TWO
The Prince and the Servants

206
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:58,290
Once there was a bad and jealous queen.

207
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:01,820
She had a kind and beautiful daughter.

208
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:07,550
Many princes from many countries wanted to
marry the princess.

209
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:15,980
The queen said to each prince, 'Before you
marry my daughter, you have to do something

210
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:18,230
for me.'

211
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:21,670
And then she gave him an impossible job.

212
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:28,780
When he couldn't do it, she said, 'Now you
will die.'

213
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:32,450
And her wood-cutter cut off his head.

214
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:37,930
'You will never marry,' she said to her unhappy
daughter.

215
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:42,640
And she laughed.

216
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:48,190
Prince Charles was the son of a poor king
in a small country.

217
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:51,440
He heard about the beautiful princess.

218
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:56,060
He said to his father, 'I want to marry her.'

219
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:57,290
'Never!'

220
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,290
cried the king.

221
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,540
'The queen will kill you.

222
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:05,630
You are my only son - I cannot lose you!

223
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:09,850
There are hundreds of beautiful women in the
world.

224
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:13,660
You don't have to marry this one.'

225
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:16,390
But the prince was very sad.

226
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:18,140
He couldn't eat.

227
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:20,190
He couldn't sleep.

228
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:26,380
In the end his father said, 'Go, then - go
to the princess!

229
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:30,100
I hope you will do better than the other princes.

230
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:34,920
I hope I will see you again.'

231
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:39,970
The prince was very excited and he danced
round his rooms.

232
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:44,240
He ate a lot of food and got strong again.

233
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,100
Then he began his journey.

234
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:51,800
He had no servants because his father was
poor.

235
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:56,550
'I'll find servants on the way,' he said.

236
00:16:56,550 --> 00:17:00,470
After a short time, the prince saw a small
mountain.

237
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:04,130
'What is that mountain?' he thought.

238
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:06,730
'It wasn't there before.'

239
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:08,490
He went nearer.

240
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:10,410
It wasn't a mountain.

241
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:15,270
It was a very fat man on his back, asleep.

242
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:19,000
The prince went near him and the fat man woke
up.

243
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:24,199
'What are you doing here, Fat Man?' asked
the prince.

244
00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:31,620
'I was asleep,' said Fat Man, 'and now I am
not asleep.

245
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:32,620
Because of you.'

246
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:36,490
'Why were you asleep?'

247
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:39,430
'Because I had some food this morning.

248
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:41,690
Now I want my lunch.'

249
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:46,720
'What did you eat this morning?' asked the
prince.

250
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:52,520
'Ten chickens and a hundred cakes,' said Fat
Man.

251
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:56,960
'Will you be my servant?' asked the prince.

252
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:03,910
'Give me food,' said the Fat Man, 'and I will
do anything for you.'

253
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:08,450
So the Fat Man followed the prince.

254
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:13,030
A short time later on their journey, they
found another man.

255
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:17,980
His head was down and his left ear was on
the ground.

256
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:19,550
He looked up.

257
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:22,970
His left ear was very large.

258
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:24,820
'What are you doing, Big Ear?'

259
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:26,620
asked the prince.

260
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:30,400
'I am listening,' said Big Ear.

261
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,840
'The flowers are opening.

262
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:37,650
The birds are singing in a country over the
sea.

263
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:39,790
I can hear them.'

264
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:44,850
'What can you hear in the house of the beautiful
princess?'

265
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:46,690
asked the prince.

266
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:49,910
'People are crying.

267
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:53,050
Another prince is dead.'

268
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:56,470
'Will you be my servant, Big Ear?'

269
00:18:56,470 --> 00:19:01,590
'Yes,' said Big Ear, 'I will.'

270
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:07,750
A short time after that, they saw two long
things by the road.

271
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:10,630
'What are they?

272
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:11,630
Trees?'

273
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:12,760
said Fat Man.

274
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,850
They went nearer.

275
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:19,230
'They're not trees,' said Big Ear.

276
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:20,810
'They're arms.

277
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:24,680
The longest arms in the world.'

278
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:29,010
A little later they saw the man's head.

279
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:32,850
'You are a very long person,' said the prince.

280
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:39,340
'I can be longer than this,' said Long Arms.

281
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:41,920
'Come with me, Long Arms,' said the prince.

282
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:44,730
'Be my servant.'

283
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:48,980
So Long Arms followed the prince.

284
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:54,400
Next they saw a man with a hand over one eye.

285
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,960
'Is there something in your eye?' asked the
prince.

286
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:01,020
'No,' said the man.

287
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:04,050
'I can see a long way.

288
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:10,850
I can see through things - buildings, mountains,
water.

289
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:15,750
When something is near me, I have to put my
hand over one eye.

290
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:18,840
Then I can see it.'

291
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:24,480
'Come with me, Quick Eyes,' said the prince,
'and be my servant.'

292
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,180
And Quick Eyes followed the prince.

293
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:32,170
They went on their journey and the sun got
very hot.

294
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:35,290
The prince opened his coat.

295
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:38,280
They came to a man by the road.

296
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:42,140
He wore two thick coats and a large hat.

297
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:44,980
They could not see his face.

298
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:50,200
He said, 'I am cold, cold, cold.'

299
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:55,740
'Why are you cold, Cold Man?' asked the prince.

300
00:20:55,740 --> 00:21:00,930
'The sun is very hot and our coats and shirts
are open.

301
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:01,930
We are hot.'

302
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:09,810
'When I open my coat,' answered Cold Man,
'the sun disappears.

303
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:12,370
It snows.

304
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:15,680
Everything dies of cold.'

305
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:19,850
'Come with me,' said the prince, 'and be my
servant.

306
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:24,290
But please don't open your coat.'

307
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:28,800
Cold Man went with the prince.

308
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:35,630
Prince Charles and his servants arrived at
the city, and the prince went to the queen.

309
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:39,290
'I want to marry the princess,' he said.

310
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:42,240
'What do I have to do?'

311
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:47,390
The queen answered, 'You will have to do three
things.

312
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:50,030
Do them well.

313
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:52,780
Then you can marry the princess.'

314
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:57,290
'What is the first thing?' asked the prince.

315
00:21:57,290 --> 00:22:01,560
'I have a beautiful blue jewel.

316
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:05,220
Yesterday it fell into the river.

317
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:10,320
Bring me the jewel before the sun goes down!'

318
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,990
The prince went back to his servants.

319
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:17,970
How can we find the jewel?' he asked them.

320
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:21,470
Quick Eyes took his hand from his eye.

321
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:24,320
'I will look for it.'

322
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,700
He went to the river.

323
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:28,810
'There it is - over there.'

324
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:33,550
'I can't see it,' said Long Arms.

325
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:38,820
Then Fat Man opened his mouth and drank the
water in the river.

326
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:42,809
A short time later, the river was dry.

327
00:22:42,809 --> 00:22:47,950
Long Arms got the jewel and gave it to the
prince.

328
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:51,340
The queen was very angry when she saw the
jewel.

329
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:59,620
Then she said, 'Tomorrow I will give this
prince a very difficult job.'

330
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:01,920
She thought hard.

331
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:05,350
She did not sleep that night.

332
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:08,970
The next morning the prince woke up early.

333
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:11,900
He went to the queen again.

334
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:18,730
'You are hungry after your long journey,'
she said, with a cold smile.

335
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:22,630
'I have thirty chickens outside.

336
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:25,970
Eat them before twelve o'clock.

337
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:31,070
I do not want to find one chicken leg.'

338
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:32,560
'Can I invite a friend?'

339
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,560
the prince asked.

340
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:37,850
'I do not like eating without a friend.'

341
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:41,990
'You can ask one friend,' said the queen.

342
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:44,520
The prince left.

343
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:49,820
'He will die this afternoon,' she said to
her daughter.

344
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:52,220
And she laughed.

345
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:55,500
The prince went back to his friends.

346
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:58,660
'Come with me, Fat Man,' he said.

347
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:02,690
Fat Man quickly ate the thirty chickens.

348
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:09,090
Then he ate the queen's other animals, the
bread in the kitchens, the fruit on the trees

349
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:12,070
and the vegetables in the ground.

350
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:16,820
'Now what can I eat?' asked Fat Man.

351
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:20,380
There was nothing there so he went to sleep.

352
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:24,960
At twelve o'clock the queen called for her
lunch.

353
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,679
She waited and waited, but no food came.

354
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:31,420
She went to see the cook.

355
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:34,100
'Where is my lunch?'

356
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,460
she asked.

357
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:41,700
'A fat man ate everything in the gardens and
everything in the kitchens.

358
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:44,050
There is no food.'

359
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:47,559
The queen got angrier and angrier.

360
00:24:47,559 --> 00:24:49,700
Then she thought of a plan.

361
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,300
'Ha ha!'

362
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,300
she laughed.

363
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:55,370
'Now I will catch him.'

364
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:58,220
The prince came to her on the third day.

365
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:01,670
'Will you eat with me tonight?'

366
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:04,080
she asked, with a lovely smile.

367
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:10,250
'And after that, would you like to sit with
the princess for two hours?'

368
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:12,650
'Yes,' answered the prince.

369
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:15,200
'I would love that.'

370
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,900
'You will not fall asleep when you are talking
to the princess?'

371
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,390
asked the queen.

372
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:23,279
'Fall asleep!'

373
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:24,680
cried the prince.

374
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,680
'Never!'

375
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:34,660
'When a person falls asleep with the princess,'
said the queen, 'the princess disappears by

376
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:36,530
magic.

377
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:41,190
Then that person dies.'

378
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:44,540
The prince put on his most beautiful clothes.

379
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:46,700
He ate with the queen.

380
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:50,330
Their conversation was very cold.

381
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:54,720
Servants brought wonderful food and wonderful
drinks.

382
00:25:54,720 --> 00:26:00,340
When the prince turned away for a minute,
the queen quickly put something into his glass

383
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:02,100
of wine.

384
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:04,429
The prince did not see.

385
00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:07,250
He drank the wine.

386
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:10,640
Then the queen took him to the princess.

387
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,790
They climbed up many stairs to a high room.

388
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:18,540
The princess sat sadly by the window.

389
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:23,480
The red light of the evening sun lit up her
beautiful face.

390
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:31,870
The river below, the flowers round the window
and her dress were the same colour.

391
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:35,190
The prince sat near the princess.

392
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:38,740
They were very happy for a short time.

393
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:43,050
But the prince's eyes suddenly felt heavy.

394
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:45,740
He started to fall asleep.

395
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:48,810
He couldn't hear the princess's words.

396
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:51,280
His eyes shut.

397
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,400
He was asleep.

398
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:58,510
Half an hour later, he opened his eyes again.

399
00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:01,330
The princess wasn't there!

400
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:05,720
He looked everywhere in the room, but he couldn't
find her!

401
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:08,810
He ran to the window and looked out.

402
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:11,150
He saw Big Ear below.

403
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:15,080
He called to him, 'The princess isn't here.

404
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:19,040
We have to find her in the next hour.'

405
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:22,820
Long Arms brought the prince down to the ground.

406
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:25,679
'Where is the princess?

407
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:27,490
Can you hear her, Big Ear?'

408
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:32,220
Big Ear put his ear to the ground.

409
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:34,480
'Yes,' he said.

410
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,950
'I can hear her.

411
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:39,179
She is calling.

412
00:27:39,179 --> 00:27:42,640
She says that she is across the river.

413
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,620
She is inside a tree.

414
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:49,540
Her mother's men put her there.'

415
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:51,290
Quick Eyes looked.

416
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:55,990
'Yes,' he said, 'I can see her.'

417
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:57,790
'But how can we get her?'

418
00:27:57,790 --> 00:28:00,270
cried the prince.

419
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:06,309
'I have an idea,' said Cold Man and he opened
his coat.

420
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:08,540
Snow fell.

421
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:10,820
Everything went white.

422
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:15,140
Cold Man jumped into the river and the water
was ice.

423
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:19,770
They ran across the ice and brought the princess
back.

424
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:25,580
Long Arms put the prince and princess back
through the window into the high room.

425
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:28,680
They sat down and the door opened.

426
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:31,809
The queen came in.

427
00:28:31,809 --> 00:28:35,910
She could not speak when she saw the princess.

428
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:38,910
She gave them a cold smile.

429
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:44,940
'We are having a very interesting conversation,'
said the prince.

430
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:50,110
'We are talking about trees and rivers.'

431
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:52,570
'Come with me,' said the queen.

432
00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:54,390
'It is night.

433
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:56,710
Your bedroom is ready.

434
00:28:56,710 --> 00:29:01,670
Your servants can sleep there too.'

435
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:08,110
The prince said goodnight to the princess
and he and his servants followed the queen.

436
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:10,290
She took them to a big room.

437
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:13,190
The queen shut the door.

438
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:20,390
She ran to the cook and said, 'Make a great
fire under their room.'

439
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:24,220
After a short time the room got very hot.

440
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:28,190
The prince went to the door but he couldn't
open it.

441
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:33,540
'I can hear a great fire below us,' said Big
Ear.

442
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:37,600
'This is wonderful,' said Cold Man.

443
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:41,310
'I feel really warm for the first time in
my life.'

444
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:46,860
'Open your coat, Cold Man,' said the prince.

445
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:51,440
When Cold Man opened his coat, the room got
colder again.

446
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:55,280
'That's better,' they said.

447
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,860
The queen listened at the door.

448
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:59,480
She heard them.

449
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:04,559
She ran to the cook and said, 'Make the fire
hotter.'

450
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:06,080
Cold Man smiled.

451
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,420
'I am warm again,' he said.

452
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:14,080
'They are cooking us,' said the other servants.

453
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:17,059
'Take off your coat,' said the prince.

454
00:30:17,059 --> 00:30:19,870
The prince took Cold Man's coat away.

455
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:25,160
'I am too cold,' said Cold Man.

456
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,080
'Please give me back my coat.'

457
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:30,370
Snow fell in the room.

458
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:33,850
The prince could not speak because he was
too cold.

459
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:36,380
Fat Man cried.

460
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:39,100
There was ice in his hair.

461
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:41,530
The queen came to the door.

462
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:42,990
She listened.

463
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:44,120
Nothing.

464
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:48,470
'They are dead now,' she said.

465
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:50,610
She opened the door.

466
00:30:50,610 --> 00:30:54,080
The prince and his servants ran out of the
room.

467
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:58,090
'Let's go and sit by a fire,' said the prince.

468
00:30:58,090 --> 00:31:03,400
'My face and hands are blue with cold.'

469
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:07,380
The queen could not win - she knew that now.

470
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:09,640
So she left the country.

471
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:14,130
The princess married the prince and they lived
happily.

472
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:17,870
And the good servants lived with them.

473
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:25,010
CHAPTER THREE
The Glass Box

474
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:27,900
Once there was a poor man.

475
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,940
His name was Hans.

476
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:37,080
He had no money, no house and no food, but
he was happy.

477
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:39,240
'I'll find something,' he said.

478
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:44,700
'I'll walk down this road to the next town.'

479
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:50,660
After a short time, a very old woman called
to him from across the road.

480
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:54,530
'What do you want?' asked Hans.

481
00:31:54,530 --> 00:31:59,740
'What do you want?' said the old woman.

482
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:01,540
'What do I want?

483
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:04,360
I want money.'

484
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:07,840
'You can have money,' said the old woman.

485
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:15,860
'Take this magic blue coat and climb to the
top of that tall tree.

486
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:18,190
Then climb down inside it.

487
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:23,140
You will come into a large room with three
hundred lights.

488
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:25,590
There are three doors.

489
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:30,950
Go through the first door and you will see
a big box.

490
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:36,050
On the box sits a dog with eyes as large as
eggs.

491
00:32:36,050 --> 00:32:41,130
Don't be afraid - it won't hurt you.

492
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:44,040
Put my blue coat on the floor.

493
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:50,050
Take the dog and put it down on the coat in
front of the box.

494
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:53,750
Open the box and you will see money.

495
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:56,350
Take some.

496
00:32:56,350 --> 00:33:01,500
'Go through the second door and you will see
a bigger box.

497
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:07,950
On the box sits a dog with eyes as large as
oranges.

498
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:12,970
Don't be afraid - it won't hurt you.

499
00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:16,860
Put the dog down on the coat in front of the
box.

500
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:21,400
Open the box and you will see gold.

501
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,530
Take some.

502
00:33:23,530 --> 00:33:25,740
'Go through the third door.

503
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:30,160
There you will see the biggest box.

504
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:36,179
On the box sits a dog with eyes as large as
plates.

505
00:33:36,179 --> 00:33:39,250
Don't be afraid - it is friendly.

506
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:42,850
There are jewels in its box.

507
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:44,110
Take some.'

508
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:48,510
'This is wonderful,' said Hans.

509
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:51,400
'But what can I do for you?'

510
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:58,299
'I don't want any money or gold or jewels,'
said the old woman.

511
00:33:58,299 --> 00:34:01,580
'I only want one little thing.

512
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:08,609
In the third room, there is a small glass
box.

513
00:34:08,609 --> 00:34:10,940
My grandmother lost it there.

514
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:13,020
Bring me that box.'

515
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:19,599
Hans climbed up the tree and then down inside
the tree.

516
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:24,479
He went down and down and down.

517
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:29,450
Then he saw the three hundred lights and the
three doors.

518
00:34:29,450 --> 00:34:33,919
He opened the first door and went into a little
room.

519
00:34:33,919 --> 00:34:40,240
There, on a box, was a dog with eyes as large
as eggs.

520
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:44,629
'Good dog!' said Hans.

521
00:34:44,629 --> 00:34:47,509
He remembered the old woman's words.

522
00:34:47,509 --> 00:34:50,529
He put her blue coat on the floor.

523
00:34:50,529 --> 00:34:55,819
He took the dog and put it down on the coat
in front of the box.

524
00:34:55,819 --> 00:34:59,910
He opened the box and he got very excited.

525
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:03,339
He took some money and put it in his hat.

526
00:35:03,339 --> 00:35:08,340
He put the dog back on the box and went into
the second room.

527
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:13,970
There, on a box, was a dog with eyes as large
as oranges.

528
00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:19,010
'You're a fine dog!' said Hans.

529
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:24,359
He put the dog down in front of the box, and
opened the box.

530
00:35:24,359 --> 00:35:29,739
His eyes were suddenly as yellow as the gold
in the box.

531
00:35:29,739 --> 00:35:34,229
Hans took some gold and put it in his hat.

532
00:35:34,229 --> 00:35:37,049
Then he went into the last room.

533
00:35:37,049 --> 00:35:40,700
This dog's eyes were as large as plates.

534
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:44,849
'You are a very fine dog!' he said.

535
00:35:44,849 --> 00:35:47,950
Hans looked at the jewels in the box.

536
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:54,410
His eyes were suddenly red, blue, yellow,
green and gold.

537
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:59,470
He took some jewels and put them in his shoes.

538
00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:03,859
Then he remembered the old woman's glass box.

539
00:36:03,859 --> 00:36:08,440
He found it on the floor next to the dog.

540
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:11,539
He climbed up inside the tree again.

541
00:36:11,539 --> 00:36:17,989
It was harder this time with the heavy gold
and jewels, but he got out of the tree.

542
00:36:17,989 --> 00:36:23,789
'Throw down the box,' called the old woman
when she saw him.

543
00:36:23,789 --> 00:36:26,430
But he did not throw it.

544
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:29,660
Suddenly a stone hit him on the head.

545
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:30,660
'Help!

546
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:35,089
I'm going to fall and die,' he thought.

547
00:36:35,089 --> 00:36:40,400
But he put out a hand and he did not fall.

548
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,520
'Did you throw that stone?' he called.

549
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:44,520
'Yes.

550
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:47,579
Now give me the box.'

551
00:36:47,579 --> 00:36:49,950
She was not very friendly now.

552
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:54,869
'I'm not going to give it to you,' he answered.

553
00:36:54,869 --> 00:37:00,309
The old woman got very angry and her face
was very ugly.

554
00:37:00,309 --> 00:37:04,859
He climbed to the ground and walked away down
the road.

555
00:37:04,859 --> 00:37:08,549
She called him names but he did not answer.

556
00:37:08,549 --> 00:37:12,880
She could do nothing.

557
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:16,119
It was night when he came to the town.

558
00:37:16,119 --> 00:37:20,839
He found a very nice room and asked for the
best food.

559
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:25,480
The next day he went out and bought beautiful
clothes.

560
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:29,670
He was a very important and rich man, people
thought.

561
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:34,160
He suddenly had many friends.

562
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:40,759
One day somebody asked him, 'Do you know about
the princess?'

563
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:43,069
'What princess?'

564
00:37:43,069 --> 00:37:44,069
asked Hans.

565
00:37:44,069 --> 00:37:45,690
'Who is she?

566
00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:47,609
Where does she live?'

567
00:37:47,609 --> 00:37:51,420
'You cannot see her,' answered the man.

568
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:53,599
'Why not?'

569
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:57,799
'Because she is in a big house and she can't
leave it.

570
00:37:57,799 --> 00:37:59,789
There is only one door.

571
00:37:59,789 --> 00:38:02,089
The windows are high up.

572
00:38:02,089 --> 00:38:03,790
She never goes out.

573
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:06,270
The king says nobody can see her.'

574
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:12,779
'Why does she live in that way?' asked Hans.

575
00:38:12,779 --> 00:38:20,339
'Because a clever old man said to the king,
"Your daughter will marry a poor man."

576
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:22,920
The king was very angry.

577
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:28,720
He built the big house with high windows and
shut the princess in it.'

578
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:33,380
'I want to see the princess,' said Hans.

579
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:36,670
He found the house and went to the door.

580
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:41,239
But the king's servants quickly sent him away.

581
00:38:41,239 --> 00:38:47,309
Then he put on his most expensive clothes
and went to the king's home.

582
00:38:47,309 --> 00:38:49,349
The king was very angry.

583
00:38:49,349 --> 00:38:52,910
'Don't come near my house again,' he shouted.

584
00:38:52,910 --> 00:39:00,160
'I will cut off your head and put it on a
stick.'

585
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:04,789
Hans lived well at this time and quickly used
his money.

586
00:39:04,789 --> 00:39:08,779
One day he only had two jewels.

587
00:39:08,779 --> 00:39:10,920
He left his nice room.

588
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:14,329
He found a poor house and lived in it.

589
00:39:14,329 --> 00:39:16,930
Hans was poor now.

590
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:19,309
Nobody cooked his food.

591
00:39:19,309 --> 00:39:21,450
Nobody cleaned his shoes.

592
00:39:21,450 --> 00:39:27,039
His rich 'friends' did not invite him to their
homes.

593
00:39:27,039 --> 00:39:34,060
He tried to find the tree with the three dogs
again, but he couldn't find it.

594
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:37,710
After a short time Hans had no money.

595
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:40,319
No money for food.

596
00:39:40,319 --> 00:39:42,749
He looked round his room.

597
00:39:42,749 --> 00:39:44,630
What could he sell?

598
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:52,660
There, on the table, he saw the little glass
box.

599
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:56,130
'Perhaps I can buy some bread with this,'
he thought.

600
00:39:56,130 --> 00:40:00,579
'Why did the old woman want it?

601
00:40:00,579 --> 00:40:05,290
It is glass but I can't see into it.

602
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:10,150
Perhaps there are jewels or gold inside.'

603
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:14,339
He tried to open the box but he couldn't.

604
00:40:14,339 --> 00:40:17,760
He hit it once with his hand.

605
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:23,589
Suddenly the dog with eyes as large as eggs
appeared in front of him.

606
00:40:23,589 --> 00:40:28,839
'What do you want?' asked the dog.

607
00:40:28,839 --> 00:40:31,339
'What do I want!'

608
00:40:31,339 --> 00:40:32,509
cried Hans.

609
00:40:32,509 --> 00:40:35,569
'I want money!'

610
00:40:35,569 --> 00:40:37,839
The dog went away.

611
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:41,799
It quickly came back with a bag of money in
its mouth.

612
00:40:41,799 --> 00:40:44,660
Hans thought.

613
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:48,469
Then he said, 'I know!

614
00:40:48,469 --> 00:40:52,489
The first dog comes when I hit the box once.

615
00:40:52,489 --> 00:40:57,049
The second dog will come when I hit the box
again.

616
00:40:57,049 --> 00:41:03,219
The third dog will come when I hit the box
three times.'

617
00:41:03,219 --> 00:41:12,049
He hit the box - one, two - and the dog with
eyes as large as oranges brought gold.

618
00:41:12,049 --> 00:41:20,059
He hit the box three times - one, two, three
- and the dog with eyes as large as plates

619
00:41:20,059 --> 00:41:22,589
brought jewels.

620
00:41:22,589 --> 00:41:24,700
Hans was rich again.

621
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:29,130
He bought beautiful clothes and moved to a
big house.

622
00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:34,460
All his 'friends' came back.

623
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:36,769
'Why didn't you visit us?'

624
00:41:36,769 --> 00:41:37,849
they said.

625
00:41:37,849 --> 00:41:40,420
'Where were you?'

626
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:43,180
Hans did not like these friends.

627
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:45,900
He thought only of the sad princess.

628
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:49,420
'She can never go out,' he thought.

629
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:52,979
'She can never walk in the garden.

630
00:41:52,979 --> 00:41:55,079
Her mother is dead.

631
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:59,749
She can only speak to the servants and the
old king.

632
00:41:59,749 --> 00:42:03,210
She has an unhappy life.'

633
00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:07,130
One night Hans could not sleep.

634
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:12,280
Suddenly he had an idea and he got up from
his bed.

635
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:16,450
He took the glass box and hit it once.

636
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:19,299
The dog came.

637
00:42:19,299 --> 00:42:26,259
'It is night - a beautiful night,' said Hans,
'and nobody will see.

638
00:42:26,259 --> 00:42:31,750
I know that the princess would like a walk
in my garden.

639
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:35,299
Bring her here.'

640
00:42:35,299 --> 00:42:38,079
Very quickly the dog came back.

641
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:41,819
The princess was asleep on its back.

642
00:42:41,819 --> 00:42:44,450
Her beautiful face was sad.

643
00:42:44,450 --> 00:42:48,319
Hans woke her and took her into the garden.

644
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:52,150
'Where am I?' she cried.

645
00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:54,700
'What is happening?'

646
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:55,720
She was afraid.

647
00:42:55,720 --> 00:43:01,720
'You are walking with me in my garden,' said
Hans.

648
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:04,219
'Look - the flowers are asleep.'

649
00:43:04,219 --> 00:43:07,009
'A garden!'

650
00:43:07,009 --> 00:43:08,479
cried the princess.

651
00:43:08,479 --> 00:43:11,299
'Am I outside?

652
00:43:11,299 --> 00:43:15,910
With the ground under my feet and the sky
over my head?

653
00:43:15,910 --> 00:43:17,990
No walls?

654
00:43:17,990 --> 00:43:20,069
No windows?

655
00:43:20,069 --> 00:43:26,380
I can hear the sounds of the night round me!'

656
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:28,599
They walked for a long time.

657
00:43:28,599 --> 00:43:31,500
Then the sun started to appear.

658
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:34,559
'I have to go,' she said.

659
00:43:34,559 --> 00:43:38,420
'But how did I get here?'

660
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:42,630
Hans told her about the glass box and the
dogs.

661
00:43:42,630 --> 00:43:45,859
She hit the box and called the dog.

662
00:43:45,859 --> 00:43:47,660
'Good dog!'

663
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:50,400
she said, when it appeared.

664
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,869
'You have beautiful eyes.

665
00:43:52,869 --> 00:43:54,789
Take me home.

666
00:43:54,789 --> 00:43:57,180
I don't want anybody to see us.

667
00:43:57,180 --> 00:44:00,740
Thank you for this night, Hans.'

668
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:06,119
The princess climbed on the dog's back and
fell asleep.

669
00:44:06,119 --> 00:44:11,739
The next day the princess did not remember
anything but she felt different.

670
00:44:11,739 --> 00:44:18,670
Her servant, Anna, a jealous and unkind woman,
woke her.

671
00:44:18,670 --> 00:44:24,420
She said, 'Wake up, princess, it is the middle
of the day.

672
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:26,900
The king is waiting for you.'

673
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:32,930
'Is he?' said the princess and she jumped
happily out of bed.

674
00:44:32,930 --> 00:44:37,880
'Look, Anna, it's a beautiful day.'

675
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:39,440
Anna started to think.

676
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:43,240
A number of things were strange.

677
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:51,349
First, the princess always got up at seven
o'clock, but today it was twelve o'clock.

678
00:44:51,349 --> 00:44:58,900
Second, the princess was always sad, but today,
she was happy.

679
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:05,460
Third, the bottom of the princess's nightdress
was dirty.

680
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:12,220
Fourth, there was a beautiful white flower
on the princess's bedroom floor, but there

681
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:15,630
were no white flowers in the king's garden.

682
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:19,380
Anna went to the king.

683
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:23,269
'Let's wait and watch,' said the king.

684
00:45:23,269 --> 00:45:29,160
'When she goes out again, well follow her.'

685
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:32,130
Hans was in love with the princess.

686
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:36,200
He thought about her all day and all night.

687
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:39,890
After three days, he couldn't wait.

688
00:45:39,890 --> 00:45:49,640
He hit the glass box - one, two - and the
dog with eyes as large as oranges appeared.

689
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:55,730
'Please bring the princess to my garden,'
he said.

690
00:45:55,730 --> 00:45:58,819
The dog went to the princess.

691
00:45:58,819 --> 00:46:01,630
But Anna was there, too.

692
00:46:01,630 --> 00:46:07,499
The dog carried the princess away on its back
and Anna followed.

693
00:46:07,499 --> 00:46:12,529
The dog stopped at the door of a big house
and went in.

694
00:46:12,529 --> 00:46:18,019
Anna wrote the letter 'X' on the door and
went home.

695
00:46:18,019 --> 00:46:23,819
Hans and the princess walked in the garden.

696
00:46:23,819 --> 00:46:31,109
Hans told the story of the old woman and the
tree and the three dogs and the glass box.

697
00:46:31,109 --> 00:46:38,249
He told the princess about his poor mother
and about his three brothers and three sisters.

698
00:46:38,249 --> 00:46:41,270
The princess loved his stories.

699
00:46:41,270 --> 00:46:43,440
She talked about her parents.

700
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:50,109
'My father was a great man and a good king,'
she said.

701
00:46:50,109 --> 00:46:54,269
'But when my mother died, he changed.

702
00:46:54,269 --> 00:46:58,690
Suddenly he was old and tired and sad.

703
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:00,930
He shut me in that house.

704
00:47:00,930 --> 00:47:05,109
Now he gets angry about little things.

705
00:47:05,109 --> 00:47:07,450
He doesn't want to be king.

706
00:47:07,450 --> 00:47:09,789
He wants white flowers in his garden.

707
00:47:09,789 --> 00:47:13,479
My mother loved white flowers.

708
00:47:13,479 --> 00:47:17,799
But now his flowers always die.'

709
00:47:17,799 --> 00:47:22,999
The red of the morning sun started to light
up the sky.

710
00:47:22,999 --> 00:47:26,180
The princess said goodnight to Hans.

711
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:33,640
He hit the box - one, two - and the second
dog appeared.

712
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:38,559
With its eyes as big as oranges, this dog
could see everything.

713
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:44,200
It saw the 'X' on the door and it told Hans.

714
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:47,650
'Ho ho!' laughed Hans.

715
00:47:47,650 --> 00:47:55,410
'Come with me quickly and we will write "X"s
on every door in this street, and the next

716
00:47:55,410 --> 00:47:58,200
ten streets!'

717
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:03,770
The next day, Anna told the king the story
of the night.

718
00:48:03,770 --> 00:48:08,670
The king took Anna and some men to Hans's
street.

719
00:48:08,670 --> 00:48:12,690
'Here is the house,' cried Anna.

720
00:48:12,690 --> 00:48:17,499
'No, here it is,' cried the king.

721
00:48:17,499 --> 00:48:21,609
One of the men ran to them.

722
00:48:21,609 --> 00:48:26,039
'The house is in the next street,' he said.

723
00:48:26,039 --> 00:48:30,430
'There is an "X" on the door.'

724
00:48:30,430 --> 00:48:34,109
Every house had an 'X' on its door.

725
00:48:34,109 --> 00:48:40,029
The king was very angry and went home.

726
00:48:40,029 --> 00:48:44,029
Later that day, Anna thought of another plan.

727
00:48:44,029 --> 00:48:48,099
She went into her room and shut the door.

728
00:48:48,099 --> 00:48:53,890
She made a small bag and she put little white
stones in the bag.

729
00:48:53,890 --> 00:49:01,140
She made a small cut in the bottom of the
bag and then put it in the princess's clothes.

730
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:09,930
'Now,' she said, 'when the princess goes out,
the little stones will fall onto the road.

731
00:49:09,930 --> 00:49:14,989
We can follow the stones to the house.'

732
00:49:14,989 --> 00:49:20,660
That night Hans called the princess again
with the glass box.

733
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:23,049
They walked in the garden.

734
00:49:23,049 --> 00:49:28,299
The dog with eyes as large as plates waited
at the front of the house.

735
00:49:28,299 --> 00:49:33,619
'I would like to be a prince,' said Hans.

736
00:49:33,619 --> 00:49:39,769
'I would like not to be a princess,' said
the princess.

737
00:49:39,769 --> 00:49:41,489
'Why?'

738
00:49:41,489 --> 00:49:43,469
asked Hans.

739
00:49:43,469 --> 00:49:45,119
She didn't answer.

740
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:52,010
'I want to be a prince,' he said, 'because
I want to marry you.'

741
00:49:52,010 --> 00:49:55,380
They sat down under a tree.

742
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:59,299
Hans put the glass box on the ground next
to him.

743
00:49:59,299 --> 00:50:02,950
'Don't be a prince,' she said.

744
00:50:02,950 --> 00:50:05,819
'I can't love a prince.

745
00:50:05,819 --> 00:50:10,960
I will be a poor girl and you will be Hans.'

746
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:17,750
At that minute the dog saw the king and Anna
with a hundred servants.

747
00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:23,079
They came out of the king's house and looked
at the little white stones.

748
00:50:23,079 --> 00:50:27,950
The white stones shone in the dark and they
followed them.

749
00:50:27,950 --> 00:50:30,529
The dog ran to the princess.

750
00:50:30,529 --> 00:50:32,489
'The king!

751
00:50:32,489 --> 00:50:34,230
The king is coming!'

752
00:50:34,230 --> 00:50:35,869
it cried.

753
00:50:35,869 --> 00:50:37,510
'Come quickly!'

754
00:50:37,510 --> 00:50:44,529
The dog ran away through the streets with
the princess on its back.

755
00:50:44,529 --> 00:50:50,549
The king, Anna and the servants arrived at
Hans's house.

756
00:50:50,549 --> 00:50:53,950
'Is the princess here?'

757
00:50:53,950 --> 00:50:56,099
cried the king.

758
00:50:56,099 --> 00:50:58,759
Hans didn't answer.

759
00:50:58,759 --> 00:51:05,900
Suddenly the king saw his daughter's little
shoe on the ground next to some beautiful

760
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:08,589
white flowers.

761
00:51:08,589 --> 00:51:11,559
He couldn't speak for a minute.

762
00:51:11,559 --> 00:51:21,440
Then he said angrily to Hans, 'My wood-cutter
will cut off your head at twelve o'clock tomorrow.'

763
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:27,910
The servants took Hans to the king's house
and shut him in a room.

764
00:51:27,910 --> 00:51:30,160
Hans looked for his glass box.

765
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:32,940
Where was it?

766
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:33,940
Lost!

767
00:51:33,940 --> 00:51:35,920
He could not call the dogs.

768
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:38,400
Then he remembered.

769
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:42,009
It was under the tree.

770
00:51:42,009 --> 00:51:47,469
When the sun came up, Hans went to the window
and looked out.

771
00:51:47,469 --> 00:51:49,880
He was very high up.

772
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:54,339
He saw a little boy below him and called to
him.

773
00:51:54,339 --> 00:51:55,469
'Hey!

774
00:51:55,469 --> 00:51:57,719
Little boy!'

775
00:51:57,719 --> 00:52:00,440
'What do you want?'

776
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:01,739
cried the boy.

777
00:52:01,739 --> 00:52:04,950
'Would you like three pence?'

778
00:52:04,950 --> 00:52:07,999
'Yes, please,' said the boy.

779
00:52:07,999 --> 00:52:10,589
'Then run to my house.

780
00:52:10,589 --> 00:52:16,579
Say to my servant, "Hans has a little glass
box.

781
00:52:16,579 --> 00:52:20,469
It is in the garden under a tree.

782
00:52:20,469 --> 00:52:24,219
He wants me to bring it to the king's house."

783
00:52:24,219 --> 00:52:29,460
When you bring me the box, I will give you
three pence.'

784
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:31,740
The boy disappeared.

785
00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:36,170
A little time later he came back with the
box.

786
00:52:36,170 --> 00:52:40,400
'Throw it up to me,' called Hans.

787
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:44,950
The boy threw up the box and Hans caught it.

788
00:52:44,950 --> 00:52:48,869
Then he threw down the money.

789
00:52:48,869 --> 00:52:54,520
At that minute, the door opened and the king's
men came in.

790
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:59,829
They took Hans to a big square in the centre
of the town.

791
00:52:59,829 --> 00:53:01,549
Everybody from the town was there.

792
00:53:01,549 --> 00:53:04,479
They wanted to watch.

793
00:53:04,479 --> 00:53:09,900
The king stood in the middle of the square
with the important people of the town round

794
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:11,119
him.

795
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:16,589
In front of Hans stood a big strong wood-cutter.

796
00:53:16,589 --> 00:53:21,749
He wore a long red coat and a tall black hat.

797
00:53:21,749 --> 00:53:27,410
'Are you ready?' said the king to the wood-cutter.

798
00:53:27,410 --> 00:53:32,749
'Are you ready?' said the wood-cutter to Hans.

799
00:53:32,749 --> 00:53:33,749
'No!'

800
00:53:33,749 --> 00:53:37,910
cried Hans, and he took out the glass box.

801
00:53:37,910 --> 00:53:42,940
'Are you ready?' said the wood-cutter to Hans.

802
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:43,940
'No!'

803
00:53:43,940 --> 00:53:48,200
cried Hans, and he hit the box once.

804
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:54,549
He hit the box again - one, two - and then
again - one, two, three.

805
00:53:54,549 --> 00:53:58,829
The three dogs stood in front of him.

806
00:53:58,829 --> 00:54:03,940
'Take the wood-cutter away,' he said to the
dog with eyes as large as eggs.

807
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:06,819
'Throw him in the river.'

808
00:54:06,819 --> 00:54:11,039
The dog ran away with the wood-cutter on his
back.

809
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:17,509
'Take the king's men away,' Hans said to the
dog with eyes as large as plates.

810
00:54:17,509 --> 00:54:20,750
The dog got bigger and bigger.

811
00:54:20,750 --> 00:54:24,059
Everybody watched with open mouths.

812
00:54:24,059 --> 00:54:27,289
Now the dog was as big as a house.

813
00:54:27,289 --> 00:54:30,749
The king's men were very afraid and ran away.

814
00:54:30,749 --> 00:54:38,380
'Bring the princess here,' Hans said to the
dog with eyes as big as oranges.

815
00:54:38,380 --> 00:54:41,619
Where is the king?' he cried.

816
00:54:41,619 --> 00:54:48,549
In a short time the princess and the king
stood in front of Hans with the dogs behind

817
00:54:48,549 --> 00:54:49,569
them.

818
00:54:49,569 --> 00:54:53,609
'Do you want to be king?'

819
00:54:53,609 --> 00:54:55,749
Hans asked the old king.

820
00:54:55,749 --> 00:54:58,549
'No,' said the king.

821
00:54:58,549 --> 00:55:04,500
'I only want to have white flowers in my garden,
and a happy daughter.'

822
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:13,809
'When the princess and I marry, white flowers
will live in your garden again and the princess

823
00:55:13,809 --> 00:55:16,619
will be happy.'

824
00:55:16,619 --> 00:55:20,339
And so Hans married the princess.

825
00:55:20,339 --> 00:55:24,990
The new king and queen lived happily for many
years.

826
00:55:24,990 --> 00:55:29,779
They had six children and a very big garden.

827
00:55:29,779 --> 00:55:33,640
The old king lived his last years near them.

828
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:42,740
His garden was a sea of white flowers all
year.

829
00:55:42,740 --> 00:55:52,749
CHAPTER FOUR
The Fisherman and the Giant

830
00:55:52,749 --> 00:55:55,950
Once there was a poor fisherman.

831
00:55:55,950 --> 00:56:01,059
He never caught many fish and so he had no
money.

832
00:56:01,059 --> 00:56:05,089
On some days he did not catch any fish.

833
00:56:05,089 --> 00:56:08,829
He couldn't buy food for his wife and three
children.

834
00:56:08,829 --> 00:56:12,240
They only ate fish!

835
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:20,730
Usually he caught very small fish, but one
day he caught a dead horse.

836
00:56:20,730 --> 00:56:24,460
'Today is a bad day,' he thought.

837
00:56:24,460 --> 00:56:28,529
Angrily, he began to fish again.

838
00:56:28,529 --> 00:56:32,640
This time he caught a bag of old cups.

839
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:35,979
Sadly, he threw them back in the water.

840
00:56:35,979 --> 00:56:39,069
'What can I do?' he said.

841
00:56:39,069 --> 00:56:41,599
'I am a poor man.

842
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:44,130
I want to sell fish.

843
00:56:44,130 --> 00:56:48,190
I want to buy food for my children.'

844
00:56:48,190 --> 00:56:50,380
He tried again.

845
00:56:50,380 --> 00:56:54,079
This time he caught an old jar.

846
00:56:54,079 --> 00:56:58,460
It looked green, but then he looked again.

847
00:56:58,460 --> 00:57:00,349
It was dirty.

848
00:57:00,349 --> 00:57:04,309
So he washed it and it was gold.

849
00:57:04,309 --> 00:57:09,690
There were some words on the top of the jar,
but he couldn't read.

850
00:57:09,690 --> 00:57:11,960
The fisherman jumped up happily.

851
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:15,599
'I can sell this now,' he said.

852
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:18,779
'Today is a good day.'

853
00:57:18,779 --> 00:57:22,160
He looked at the jar carefully.

854
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:24,460
'Perhaps there is something inside,' he thought.

855
00:57:24,460 --> 00:57:27,229
'I'll open it.'

856
00:57:27,229 --> 00:57:31,480
So he opened the jar and looked inside.

857
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:37,109
Suddenly white smoke came out of the jar and
a great giant appeared.

858
00:57:37,109 --> 00:57:40,009
The fisherman was very afraid.

859
00:57:40,009 --> 00:57:41,920
The giant spoke.

860
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:44,499
'Now, fisherman.

861
00:57:44,499 --> 00:57:47,470
I am going to kill you.'

862
00:57:47,470 --> 00:57:48,769
'Why?'

863
00:57:48,769 --> 00:57:49,769
cried the fisherman.

864
00:57:49,769 --> 00:57:52,289
'What did I do?'

865
00:57:52,289 --> 00:57:54,890
'You opened the jar.

866
00:57:54,890 --> 00:57:58,099
For that I am going to kill you.

867
00:57:58,099 --> 00:58:00,249
How do you want to die?

868
00:58:00,249 --> 00:58:06,519
I can kill you with my hands, or I can throw
you into the sea.'

869
00:58:06,519 --> 00:58:09,299
'But why do you have to kill me?'

870
00:58:09,299 --> 00:58:13,210
'I will tell you,' said the giant.

871
00:58:13,210 --> 00:58:18,329
'One day, the King of the Giants was very
angry with me.

872
00:58:18,329 --> 00:58:26,390
I took his youngest and loveliest daughter
for a walk by the sea and he didn't like it.

873
00:58:26,390 --> 00:58:29,259
So he put me in this jar.

874
00:58:29,259 --> 00:58:34,789
I could not get out because he wrote his name
on the top of the jar.

875
00:58:34,789 --> 00:58:37,499
I could hear him from inside the jar.

876
00:58:37,499 --> 00:58:44,400
"Because you love the sea, you dog," he cried,
"you can live in it!"

877
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:47,239
And he threw me in the water.

878
00:58:47,239 --> 00:58:51,359
'I was in the jar for days and weeks.

879
00:58:51,359 --> 00:58:56,290
"One day somebody will open this bottle,"
I thought.

880
00:58:56,290 --> 00:59:01,819
"And I will make them into a great king or
queen."

881
00:59:01,819 --> 00:59:07,089
But after a hundred years, nobody opened the
bottle.

882
00:59:07,089 --> 00:59:16,640
So I thought, "I will make them into a king
or queen but not a great king or queen."

883
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:20,479
After 200 years, I thought, "Where is this
person?

884
00:59:20,479 --> 00:59:27,619
Now I will make them rich, but I will not
make them a king or queen."

885
00:59:27,619 --> 00:59:31,969
After 300 years, I was very angry."

886
00:59:31,969 --> 00:59:36,809
When somebody opens the jar, I will kill them,"
I thought.

887
00:59:36,809 --> 00:59:40,619
You are that person, Fisherman.

888
00:59:40,619 --> 00:59:42,709
How do you want to die?'

889
00:59:42,709 --> 00:59:46,579
'I have one question,' said the fisherman.

890
00:59:46,579 --> 00:59:49,199
'Will you answer it?'

891
00:59:49,199 --> 00:59:53,539
'I will,' said the giant, 'but ask quickly.'

892
00:59:53,539 --> 00:59:56,819
'Were you in that jar?'

893
00:59:56,819 --> 01:00:00,160
'Yes, I was,' answered the giant.

894
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:01,259
'You saw me.'

895
01:00:01,259 --> 01:00:04,009
'But you are so big.

896
01:00:04,009 --> 01:00:07,200
Your hand is as big as the jar.

897
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:09,369
Think before you speak.

898
01:00:09,369 --> 01:00:13,059
Is there nothing inside your head?'

899
01:00:13,059 --> 01:00:15,660
The giant was not very clever.

900
01:00:15,660 --> 01:00:20,749
'I will show you,' he said angrily.

901
01:00:20,749 --> 01:00:27,270
Suddenly he disappeared into white smoke again,
and the smoke went inside the jar.

902
01:00:27,270 --> 01:00:31,190
'You see!' he called from inside.

903
01:00:31,190 --> 01:00:34,720
The fisherman quickly put the top back on
the jar.

904
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:35,720
'Hah!

905
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:38,109
Now, Giant,' he said.

906
01:00:38,109 --> 01:00:42,009
'I will throw the jar back into the sea.

907
01:00:42,009 --> 01:00:45,869
Perhaps somebody will find you in another
300 years.'

908
01:00:45,869 --> 01:00:50,339
'Please open the jar,' called the Giant.

909
01:00:50,339 --> 01:00:53,400
'I will make you a rich man.'

910
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:54,400
'No.

911
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:58,150
You will kill me,' answered the fisherman.

912
01:00:58,150 --> 01:01:01,410
'No, I won't,' said the giant.

913
01:01:01,410 --> 01:01:02,410
'I won't.

914
01:01:02,410 --> 01:01:06,630
I'll make you very, very rich.'

915
01:01:06,630 --> 01:01:09,040
The fisherman thought for a minute.

916
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:14,190
'All right, then,' he said, and opened the
jar.

917
01:01:14,190 --> 01:01:18,920
White smoke came out of the jar and the giant
appeared again.

918
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:21,740
He quickly threw the jar into the sea.

919
01:01:21,740 --> 01:01:25,549
'Thank you,' he said to the fisherman.

920
01:01:25,549 --> 01:01:28,089
'I will not forget this.

921
01:01:28,089 --> 01:01:30,940
Come with me.'

922
01:01:30,940 --> 01:01:36,799
The fisherman followed the giant round the
city walls and over a mountain.

923
01:01:36,799 --> 01:01:41,079
There they came to a great blue and gold sea.

924
01:01:41,079 --> 01:01:44,329
In the water there were many fish.

925
01:01:44,329 --> 01:01:47,650
'Now, catch something.

926
01:01:47,650 --> 01:01:51,710
I will watch you,' said the giant.

927
01:01:51,710 --> 01:02:01,049
In no time, the fisherman caught three fish
- three beautiful red, white and gold fish.

928
01:02:01,049 --> 01:02:04,569
'Take these fish to your king,' said the giant.

929
01:02:04,569 --> 01:02:08,250
'He will give you a lot of money for them.'

930
01:02:08,250 --> 01:02:15,979
The giant disappeared, and blue and gold smoke
went into the ground.

931
01:02:15,979 --> 01:02:23,599
When the king saw the fish, he said to the
fisherman, 'Those are beautiful fish!

932
01:02:23,599 --> 01:02:26,859
I will give you gold for them.'

933
01:02:26,859 --> 01:02:31,299
Then he said to his servant, 'Take these fish
to the cook.

934
01:02:31,299 --> 01:02:36,099
We will eat them today.'

935
01:02:36,099 --> 01:02:39,650
The fisherman took his gold home to his family.

936
01:02:39,650 --> 01:02:48,309
They ate a wonderful dinner of bread, meat,
fruit, vegetables and no fish.

937
01:02:48,309 --> 01:02:53,189
For the first time in their lives, they were
not hungry.

938
01:02:53,189 --> 01:02:57,539
The king's cook put the fish over the fire.

939
01:02:57,539 --> 01:02:59,490
They started to cook.

940
01:02:59,490 --> 01:03:07,059
Suddenly, the smoke from the fire went blue
and gold and a strange woman appeared in the

941
01:03:07,059 --> 01:03:08,249
kitchen.

942
01:03:08,249 --> 01:03:10,359
She spoke to the fish.

943
01:03:10,359 --> 01:03:12,719
'Fish, fish!

944
01:03:12,719 --> 01:03:16,299
Are you doing your work?'

945
01:03:16,299 --> 01:03:19,109
The fish did not answer.

946
01:03:19,109 --> 01:03:26,160
Then their heads went up, and they said, 'We
are, and we are happy.'

947
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:30,510
The strange woman pushed the fish into the
fire.

948
01:03:30,510 --> 01:03:35,360
The smoke from the fire went blue and gold
and the woman disappeared into it.

949
01:03:35,360 --> 01:03:40,469
The king and his servant came into the kitchen.

950
01:03:40,469 --> 01:03:43,650
'I am waiting for the fish.

951
01:03:43,650 --> 01:03:47,859
Where are they?' he said to the cook.

952
01:03:47,859 --> 01:03:52,809
He saw that the fish were in the fire and
he could not eat them.

953
01:03:52,809 --> 01:03:56,380
The cook told him about the strange woman.

954
01:03:56,380 --> 01:04:01,469
The king wanted to see the woman so he sent
for the fisherman.

955
01:04:01,469 --> 01:04:06,430
'Bring me three more fish!' he said.

956
01:04:06,430 --> 01:04:12,859
When the fisherman came back with three more
fish, the king gave him more gold.

957
01:04:12,859 --> 01:04:16,529
The cook put the fish over the fire.

958
01:04:16,529 --> 01:04:23,559
This time the smoke from the fire went red
and gold and a big man with red hair appeared.

959
01:04:23,559 --> 01:04:26,029
'Fish, fish!

960
01:04:26,029 --> 01:04:28,549
Are you doing your work?'

961
01:04:28,549 --> 01:04:31,859
The fish answered, 'We are, we are!

962
01:04:31,859 --> 01:04:34,509
And we are happy!'

963
01:04:34,509 --> 01:04:37,359
And the same thing happened.

964
01:04:37,359 --> 01:04:44,979
The man pushed the fish into the fire and
disappeared into the red and gold smoke.

965
01:04:44,979 --> 01:04:48,130
The king did not speak for a minute.

966
01:04:48,130 --> 01:04:50,289
This was magic!

967
01:04:50,289 --> 01:04:52,400
Then he turned to the fisherman.

968
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:56,390
'Where do you get these fish?' he asked.

969
01:04:56,390 --> 01:05:02,359
'I get them from a sea of blue and gold water
over the mountain.'

970
01:05:02,359 --> 01:05:05,599
'Do you know this sea?'

971
01:05:05,599 --> 01:05:08,059
the king asked his servant.

972
01:05:08,059 --> 01:05:09,059
'No.

973
01:05:09,059 --> 01:05:15,059
I often go across the mountain, but there
is no blue and gold sea.'

974
01:05:15,059 --> 01:05:17,890
'Will you take us there?'

975
01:05:17,890 --> 01:05:21,729
the king asked the fisherman.

976
01:05:21,729 --> 01:05:28,549
The king and his men followed the fisherman
over the mountain to the sea of blue and gold

977
01:05:28,549 --> 01:05:31,900
and there they saw the wonderful fish.

978
01:05:31,900 --> 01:05:34,469
The fish were jewels in the water.

979
01:05:34,469 --> 01:05:39,130
'Wait here,' said the king.

980
01:05:39,130 --> 01:05:43,099
He took two men and went round the sea.

981
01:05:43,099 --> 01:05:47,390
There they came to a great house of red stone.

982
01:05:47,390 --> 01:05:52,160
All round the house were gardens of wonderful
flowers.

983
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:54,769
There was no answer at the door.

984
01:05:54,769 --> 01:05:58,609
But it was open so the king went in.

985
01:05:58,609 --> 01:06:03,450
He saw many beautiful rooms but no people.

986
01:06:03,450 --> 01:06:08,880
He came into a very large room with high windows.

987
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:12,489
Somebody spoke: 'When will I die?

988
01:06:12,489 --> 01:06:16,229
I don't want to live.'

989
01:06:16,229 --> 01:06:21,009
The king saw a young man at the other end
of the room.

990
01:06:21,009 --> 01:06:25,380
He was on the floor with a coat over his feet.

991
01:06:25,380 --> 01:06:33,670
'I know you are a king,' said the young man,
'but I cannot stand up.'

992
01:06:33,670 --> 01:06:41,910
The king took away the coat and saw that his
feet were fine white stone.

993
01:06:41,910 --> 01:06:43,430
'What is this?'

994
01:06:43,430 --> 01:06:44,609
cried the king.

995
01:06:44,609 --> 01:06:48,249
'Why do you have stone feet?

996
01:06:48,249 --> 01:06:50,910
Why do the fish talk?

997
01:06:50,910 --> 01:06:55,720
Why does a man with red hair appear from nowhere
in my kitchen?

998
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:58,930
What is happening?

999
01:06:58,930 --> 01:07:00,049
Tell me.'

1000
01:07:00,049 --> 01:07:04,910
'I will tell you,' said the young man.

1001
01:07:04,910 --> 01:07:08,549
'Please sit down and listen.

1002
01:07:08,549 --> 01:07:12,420
There was once a great city in this place.

1003
01:07:12,420 --> 01:07:18,130
My father was king of that city, and I was
a prince.

1004
01:07:18,130 --> 01:07:21,680
Then my father died and I was the king.

1005
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:25,410
I married a beautiful woman.

1006
01:07:25,410 --> 01:07:29,339
She was my queen but she did not love me.

1007
01:07:29,339 --> 01:07:31,640
She loved a servant.

1008
01:07:31,640 --> 01:07:36,809
When I learnt about him, I wanted to kill
that servant.

1009
01:07:36,809 --> 01:07:38,449
We had a fight.

1010
01:07:38,449 --> 01:07:41,489
I hurt him but I didn't kill him.

1011
01:07:41,489 --> 01:07:43,779
He could not use his legs.

1012
01:07:43,779 --> 01:07:47,589
'My wife was very angry.

1013
01:07:47,589 --> 01:07:52,210
She can do magic and she changed my feet to
white stone.

1014
01:07:52,210 --> 01:07:57,519
Then I could not use my legs.

1015
01:07:57,519 --> 01:08:00,039
That was not the end of it.

1016
01:08:00,039 --> 01:08:06,319
Three mountains and a blue and gold sea appeared
in place of the city.

1017
01:08:06,319 --> 01:08:10,640
She changed the men and women of the city
into fish.

1018
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:16,319
'There is a little house of white stone in
the garden of this house.

1019
01:08:16,319 --> 01:08:18,020
The servant lives there.

1020
01:08:18,020 --> 01:08:20,029
He cannot walk.

1021
01:08:20,029 --> 01:08:24,960
My wife visits him every day.'

1022
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:29,779
The king went into the garden and thought
for some time.

1023
01:08:29,779 --> 01:08:33,299
Then he went to the house of white stone.

1024
01:08:33,299 --> 01:08:37,929
He found the servant inside and killed him.

1025
01:08:37,929 --> 01:08:42,670
He put the servant under the bed and then
climbed onto it.

1026
01:08:42,670 --> 01:08:46,029
He pulled the servant's jacket over his face.

1027
01:08:46,029 --> 01:08:49,279
Sometime later, the queen came in.

1028
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:54,420
'Are you happy, my dearest servant?'

1029
01:08:54,420 --> 01:08:56,029
she asked.

1030
01:08:56,029 --> 01:08:58,719
'No,' said the king.

1031
01:08:58,719 --> 01:09:01,380
'I cannot sleep.

1032
01:09:01,380 --> 01:09:03,509
Somebody is crying.

1033
01:09:03,509 --> 01:09:08,630
The young king is crying because of his stone
feet.'

1034
01:09:08,630 --> 01:09:14,790
The queen went to the young king and threw
some magic water over his feet.

1035
01:09:14,790 --> 01:09:18,560
He stood up and walked.

1036
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:21,279
Then she came back to the house of white stone.

1037
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:29,660
'And I cannot sleep,' the king said, 'because
the men and women of the city cry at night.

1038
01:09:29,660 --> 01:09:32,180
They do not want to be fish.'

1039
01:09:32,180 --> 01:09:36,650
So the queen went to the blue and gold sea.

1040
01:09:36,650 --> 01:09:38,989
She said some magic words.

1041
01:09:38,989 --> 01:09:42,559
A great city appeared all round her.

1042
01:09:42,559 --> 01:09:48,349
Men and women ran happily through the streets
and in and out of the houses.

1043
01:09:48,349 --> 01:09:51,900
Then the queen came back to the house of white
stone.

1044
01:09:51,900 --> 01:09:55,790
'Are you happy now, my dear servant?'

1045
01:09:55,790 --> 01:09:57,329
she asked.

1046
01:09:57,329 --> 01:10:00,510
'Yes, my love,' he said.

1047
01:10:00,510 --> 01:10:02,940
'Come near me.'

1048
01:10:02,940 --> 01:10:04,679
She came near him.

1049
01:10:04,679 --> 01:10:06,900
'Come nearer.

1050
01:10:06,900 --> 01:10:10,380
I want to put my arms round you.'

1051
01:10:10,380 --> 01:10:12,929
She came nearer his bed.

1052
01:10:12,929 --> 01:10:15,449
He put his arms round her.

1053
01:10:15,449 --> 01:10:20,820
In one hand he had a knife, and he killed
her.

1054
01:10:20,820 --> 01:10:23,090
He went back to the young king.

1055
01:10:23,090 --> 01:10:25,880
'Your queen is dead.

1056
01:10:25,880 --> 01:10:29,900
The city and its people are living.'

1057
01:10:29,900 --> 01:10:34,630
The older king and the young king were friends
after that.

1058
01:10:34,630 --> 01:10:37,460
One city helped the other city.

1059
01:10:37,460 --> 01:10:40,860
But nobody ate fish again.

1060
01:10:40,860 --> 01:10:43,880
The fisherman and his family were happy.

1061
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:48,420
The two kings sent them gold and beautiful
things.

1062
01:10:48,420 --> 01:10:51,210
They were never hungry again.

1063
01:10:51,210 --> 01:10:58,300
CHAPTER FIVE
The White Birds

1064
01:10:58,300 --> 01:11:04,300
Once there was a king with ten sons and one
daughter.

1065
01:11:04,300 --> 01:11:09,630
Their mother died when the daughter, Elisa,
was born.

1066
01:11:09,630 --> 01:11:13,630
They were very good, happy children.

1067
01:11:13,630 --> 01:11:19,120
Then the king fell in love with another woman
and he married her.

1068
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:25,130
He loved his new queen and in his eyes she
was always right.

1069
01:11:25,130 --> 01:11:28,400
But she was a bad, jealous woman.

1070
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:34,280
She hated the king's ten sons, and she wanted
to send them away.

1071
01:11:34,280 --> 01:11:36,600
Love made the king stupid.

1072
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:39,699
It can make everybody stupid.

1073
01:11:39,699 --> 01:11:45,409
The poor old king sadly said goodbye to his
sons.

1074
01:11:45,409 --> 01:11:49,660
Then the queen took them outside the city
walls.

1075
01:11:49,660 --> 01:11:57,219
She said some magic words and changed the
ten boys into ten white birds.

1076
01:11:57,219 --> 01:12:02,420
'Fly away to another country,' she said.

1077
01:12:02,420 --> 01:12:05,090
'Make your homes in treetops.

1078
01:12:05,090 --> 01:12:09,030
Find your food on the ground.'

1079
01:12:09,030 --> 01:12:15,680
And the ten brothers flew high into the sky
and away over mountains and rivers.

1080
01:12:15,680 --> 01:12:24,679
They came to a great sea and they made their
home in some trees next to it.

1081
01:12:24,679 --> 01:12:30,699
When Elisa learned about her brothers, she
ran away from the king's house.

1082
01:12:30,699 --> 01:12:32,949
She cried for hours.

1083
01:12:32,949 --> 01:12:35,630
She walked for days.

1084
01:12:35,630 --> 01:12:40,510
She did not use her eyes - she followed her
love for her brothers.

1085
01:12:40,510 --> 01:12:45,520
'One day I will find them,' she thought.

1086
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:50,909
And her love took her near their home by the
great sea.

1087
01:12:50,909 --> 01:12:55,530
Night came and Elisa fell asleep under a tree.

1088
01:12:55,530 --> 01:13:02,599
All night the fairies watched her and no dangerous
animal came near her.

1089
01:13:02,599 --> 01:13:06,280
The next morning she walked again.

1090
01:13:06,280 --> 01:13:08,280
She met an old woman.

1091
01:13:08,280 --> 01:13:11,790
'What are you doing here?

1092
01:13:11,790 --> 01:13:17,940
Can't a brother or friend help you?' asked
the old woman.

1093
01:13:17,940 --> 01:13:20,260
She gave Elisa some good food.

1094
01:13:20,260 --> 01:13:23,920
Elisa told her the story of her brothers.

1095
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:30,670
'I am looking for ten fine princes on ten
white horses,' she said.

1096
01:13:30,670 --> 01:13:33,949
'Do you know of them?'

1097
01:13:33,949 --> 01:13:35,730
'Ten princes?'

1098
01:13:35,730 --> 01:13:36,800
said the woman.

1099
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:42,620
'No, but I saw ten white birds this morning.

1100
01:13:42,620 --> 01:13:46,070
They had gold feet and jewels for eyes.

1101
01:13:46,070 --> 01:13:49,449
Perhaps they were princes.

1102
01:13:49,449 --> 01:13:51,829
They were by the river.'

1103
01:13:51,829 --> 01:13:54,140
She took Elisa to the river.

1104
01:13:54,140 --> 01:13:58,540
Elisa followed the river to the great sea.

1105
01:13:58,540 --> 01:14:01,330
She saw ten fine white birds.

1106
01:14:01,330 --> 01:14:06,590
Their gold feet and jewel-eyes shone in the
sun.

1107
01:14:06,590 --> 01:14:12,389
All round her Elisa saw pretty flowers and
beautiful trees.

1108
01:14:12,389 --> 01:14:17,389
Elisa built a small house from sticks.

1109
01:14:17,389 --> 01:14:21,679
She found flowers and put them round the walls.

1110
01:14:21,679 --> 01:14:28,690
When she came back, she found bread, eggs
and fish near the door.

1111
01:14:28,690 --> 01:14:32,320
That night her brothers came to her.

1112
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:33,550
She cried.

1113
01:14:33,550 --> 01:14:37,050
'Don't be sad,' they said.

1114
01:14:37,050 --> 01:14:38,929
'We'll tell you some stories.'

1115
01:14:38,929 --> 01:14:44,250
Their stories were funny and after a time
she smiled.

1116
01:14:44,250 --> 01:14:47,389
Then she laughed.

1117
01:14:47,389 --> 01:14:51,079
When it was late, the brothers flew up into
a tree.

1118
01:14:51,079 --> 01:14:54,969
'Sleep well, Elisa,' they said.

1119
01:14:54,969 --> 01:14:58,079
'We are watching you.'

1120
01:14:58,079 --> 01:15:02,500
In her sleep, Elisa saw the old woman again.

1121
01:15:02,500 --> 01:15:04,960
Now she was a beautiful fairy.

1122
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:08,860
'Do you want to help your brothers?'

1123
01:15:08,860 --> 01:15:10,079
she asked.

1124
01:15:10,079 --> 01:15:11,520
'Yes!' cried Elisa.

1125
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:12,520
'Of course!'

1126
01:15:12,520 --> 01:15:13,520
'Are you strong?'

1127
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:14,520
'Yes!

1128
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:17,730
I am strong.'

1129
01:15:17,730 --> 01:15:22,840
'Then listen to my words and follow them.

1130
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:26,210
There are gold flowers near your little house.

1131
01:15:26,210 --> 01:15:30,409
Take some home and put them in water from
the river.

1132
01:15:30,409 --> 01:15:35,639
Wash them many times and then make them into
coats.

1133
01:15:35,639 --> 01:15:41,420
Ten coats of gold flowers, one for each brother.

1134
01:15:41,420 --> 01:15:48,429
'But remember these things: First, only you
can make the coats.

1135
01:15:48,429 --> 01:15:54,300
Second, you can only speak after you finish
them.

1136
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:59,050
Don't speak before that, or your brothers
will die.

1137
01:15:59,050 --> 01:16:00,969
Can you do these things?'

1138
01:16:00,969 --> 01:16:08,429
'Yes,' answered the princess in her sleep,
and she woke up.

1139
01:16:08,429 --> 01:16:13,190
She looked outside her door and saw the gold
flowers.

1140
01:16:13,190 --> 01:16:18,199
She followed the fairy's words and she worked
all day.

1141
01:16:18,199 --> 01:16:22,360
When the sun went down, her fingers hurt.

1142
01:16:22,360 --> 01:16:26,010
Her brothers came that night, but she did
not speak to them.

1143
01:16:26,010 --> 01:16:28,620
'Why are you not speaking?'

1144
01:16:28,620 --> 01:16:30,079
they asked.

1145
01:16:30,079 --> 01:16:33,869
'Is this the work of a bad fairy?'

1146
01:16:33,869 --> 01:16:35,949
She showed them her work.

1147
01:16:35,949 --> 01:16:39,890
She made a picture of ten coats on the ground
with her finger.

1148
01:16:39,890 --> 01:16:44,610
Then they understood - her work was for them.

1149
01:16:44,610 --> 01:16:47,380
She worked and worked.

1150
01:16:47,380 --> 01:16:51,310
Her brothers watched her.

1151
01:16:51,310 --> 01:16:55,170
After two or three weeks, six coats were ready.

1152
01:16:55,170 --> 01:17:01,610
Then one day, when she was by the river, a
dog suddenly appeared.

1153
01:17:01,610 --> 01:17:03,290
It jumped at her.

1154
01:17:03,290 --> 01:17:05,429
Then other dogs came.

1155
01:17:05,429 --> 01:17:08,969
They made a great noise and ran round her.

1156
01:17:08,969 --> 01:17:15,719
A man came through the trees on a fine white
horse, with many men behind him.

1157
01:17:15,719 --> 01:17:20,330
Elisa looked at this man and she loved him.

1158
01:17:20,330 --> 01:17:24,090
'Who are you?' he asked her.

1159
01:17:24,090 --> 01:17:25,750
'Nobody lives here.

1160
01:17:25,750 --> 01:17:27,469
Where are you from?'

1161
01:17:27,469 --> 01:17:30,130
Elisa could not answer him.

1162
01:17:30,130 --> 01:17:35,449
'I am the king of a great country behind those
mountains,' he told her.

1163
01:17:35,449 --> 01:17:40,800
'I often come here with my dogs and horses.'

1164
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:44,739
He came every day and spoke to Elisa.

1165
01:17:44,739 --> 01:17:49,369
They walked by the river and he told her about
his life.

1166
01:17:49,369 --> 01:17:52,890
He loved her and he wanted her to be his queen.

1167
01:17:52,890 --> 01:17:56,110
But why did she not speak?

1168
01:17:56,110 --> 01:18:00,000
She only spoke to him with her eyes.

1169
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:05,409
In the end, he asked her, 'Will you be my
queen?'

1170
01:18:05,409 --> 01:18:07,960
Poor Elisa started to cry.

1171
01:18:07,960 --> 01:18:10,020
She ran to the gold flowers.

1172
01:18:10,020 --> 01:18:15,300
'We will take the gold flowers and your work
to my house.

1173
01:18:15,300 --> 01:18:16,949
You can work there.

1174
01:18:16,949 --> 01:18:19,500
Will you come?'

1175
01:18:19,500 --> 01:18:22,860
She could not say no, because she loved him.

1176
01:18:22,860 --> 01:18:29,520
'So Elisa and the king took the flowers and
the coats - there were eight now - to his

1177
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:30,810
country.

1178
01:18:30,810 --> 01:18:39,070
Her brothers were sad, but each day they flew
high above the king's house.

1179
01:18:39,070 --> 01:18:43,130
The king had a jealous younger brother.

1180
01:18:43,130 --> 01:18:47,630
He wanted to be king and he wanted his brother
to die.

1181
01:18:47,630 --> 01:18:50,610
When the king married, he was angry.

1182
01:18:50,610 --> 01:18:57,230
'Now the king will have a son,' he thought,
'and I will never be king.'

1183
01:18:57,230 --> 01:19:01,880
The king could not see inside his jealous
brother's head.

1184
01:19:01,880 --> 01:19:07,710
Because he was good and kind, everybody was
good and kind.

1185
01:19:07,710 --> 01:19:11,790
One day the king had to leave the city for
many days.

1186
01:19:11,790 --> 01:19:16,050
He had to visit an important king in another
country.

1187
01:19:16,050 --> 01:19:20,260
The queen stayed at home and worked on her
coats.

1188
01:19:20,260 --> 01:19:21,750
Now she had nine.

1189
01:19:21,750 --> 01:19:25,270
But she had no more flowers.

1190
01:19:25,270 --> 01:19:28,500
She looked everywhere for the gold flowers.

1191
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:32,460
Then she found some flowers in a bad place.

1192
01:19:32,460 --> 01:19:36,040
The people of the city threw their dead animals
there.

1193
01:19:36,040 --> 01:19:40,800
'I cannot go there in daylight,' thought the
queen.

1194
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:42,150
'People will see me.

1195
01:19:42,150 --> 01:19:46,590
They will not understand and I cannot tell
them.'

1196
01:19:46,590 --> 01:19:48,940
So she waited for night.

1197
01:19:48,940 --> 01:19:53,550
Then she went out and got some flowers.

1198
01:19:53,550 --> 01:19:57,710
The king's younger brother saw the queen that
night.

1199
01:19:57,710 --> 01:20:00,690
He followed her and watched her.

1200
01:20:00,690 --> 01:20:03,800
He waited the next night and followed her
again.

1201
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:07,800
'Now I have a plan,' he thought.

1202
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:10,680
He followed her for five nights.

1203
01:20:10,680 --> 01:20:16,280
The next night he called the great men and
women of the city to a place outside the city

1204
01:20:16,280 --> 01:20:17,280
walls.

1205
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:20,140
'Why are we meeting in the dark?'

1206
01:20:20,140 --> 01:20:21,500
they asked.

1207
01:20:21,500 --> 01:20:24,889
'You will see,' he answered.

1208
01:20:24,889 --> 01:20:28,000
'You will learn something about your queen.

1209
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:31,210
Now, everybody, be quiet.

1210
01:20:31,210 --> 01:20:33,860
Wait here with me and watch.

1211
01:20:33,860 --> 01:20:38,469
What does our lovely queen do every night
when the king is away?

1212
01:20:38,469 --> 01:20:41,800
What do you think?'

1213
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:46,429
A little time later, the queen appeared and
got the flowers.

1214
01:20:46,429 --> 01:20:51,360
She started to walk home, but the king's brother
ran after her.

1215
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:53,750
He caught her arm.

1216
01:20:53,750 --> 01:20:56,020
'See!' he cried to the people.

1217
01:20:56,020 --> 01:20:57,750
'She is a bad woman.

1218
01:20:57,750 --> 01:21:02,789
Only a bad woman looks for flowers in this
place at night.

1219
01:21:02,789 --> 01:21:05,570
She uses them for bad magic.

1220
01:21:05,570 --> 01:21:09,550
She plans to kill our dear king, my brother.

1221
01:21:09,550 --> 01:21:12,020
Why do you think she never speaks?

1222
01:21:12,020 --> 01:21:15,710
Because she can only say magic words!'

1223
01:21:15,710 --> 01:21:20,630
People shouted, 'Kill her!', 'Put her on a
fire!'

1224
01:21:20,630 --> 01:21:25,130
And the king's brother said, 'Let's kill her
before the king comes back.

1225
01:21:25,130 --> 01:21:27,760
Or she will kill him!'

1226
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:31,010
He took the queen back to her room.

1227
01:21:31,010 --> 01:21:38,000
'Tomorrow,' he said to her before he closed
the door, 'you will die!'

1228
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:43,210
The king and his servants were one day's journey
away from the city.

1229
01:21:43,210 --> 01:21:48,530
They found a place for the night and got off
their horses.

1230
01:21:48,530 --> 01:21:53,219
The king looked up and saw a white bird in
the sky.

1231
01:21:53,219 --> 01:21:58,480
The bird flew down to the king and the king's
horse was afraid.

1232
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:03,650
The king shouted at the bird, but it did not
go away.

1233
01:22:03,650 --> 01:22:09,949
Then he looked again and saw its gold feet
and jewel-eyes.

1234
01:22:09,949 --> 01:22:12,469
'It is one of the fairy birds,' he thought.

1235
01:22:12,469 --> 01:22:15,590
'One of the queen's birds.

1236
01:22:15,590 --> 01:22:18,619
She can understand their cries but I cannot.

1237
01:22:18,619 --> 01:22:23,090
I think it wants me to go back quickly to
the city.'

1238
01:22:23,090 --> 01:22:24,610
The king called his men.

1239
01:22:24,610 --> 01:22:28,250
'We are not staying here tonight,' he told
them.

1240
01:22:28,250 --> 01:22:30,920
'We are going to the city now.

1241
01:22:30,920 --> 01:22:33,739
We have to go back to the queen.

1242
01:22:33,739 --> 01:22:35,429
Get ready quickly.

1243
01:22:35,429 --> 01:22:37,139
I am leaving now.

1244
01:22:37,139 --> 01:22:39,420
Follow me!'

1245
01:22:39,420 --> 01:22:43,840
The king and his men followed the white bird
all night.

1246
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:47,900
The bird called to them, 'Quickly.

1247
01:22:47,900 --> 01:22:49,360
Quickly.'

1248
01:22:49,360 --> 01:22:56,010
In the city, Elisa worked all night with her
gold flowers.

1249
01:22:56,010 --> 01:23:02,340
The next morning the people of the city met
in the big square in front of the king's house.

1250
01:23:02,340 --> 01:23:04,010
They looked up at the sky.

1251
01:23:04,010 --> 01:23:07,050
'What are those white birds up there?

1252
01:23:07,050 --> 01:23:10,969
Why are they making this noise?'

1253
01:23:10,969 --> 01:23:14,940
Men brought sticks and built a large fire.

1254
01:23:14,940 --> 01:23:18,250
The birds flew down and round the men's heads.

1255
01:23:18,250 --> 01:23:21,530
They took some sticks and flew away.

1256
01:23:21,530 --> 01:23:24,590
But they could not take every stick.

1257
01:23:24,590 --> 01:23:27,760
The king's brother went to the queen's room.

1258
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:31,050
He brought her outside and into the square.

1259
01:23:31,050 --> 01:23:37,199
She carried the gold coats in her arms, and
the birds flew with her.

1260
01:23:37,199 --> 01:23:42,380
At the same time the king arrived at the opposite
end of the square.

1261
01:23:42,380 --> 01:23:45,670
His white bird flew over the people's heads.

1262
01:23:45,670 --> 01:23:49,780
'It is the queen,' cried the king.

1263
01:23:49,780 --> 01:23:53,030
He fought his way through the people to the
middle of the square.

1264
01:23:53,030 --> 01:23:55,739
'A fire?' cried the king.

1265
01:23:55,739 --> 01:23:58,820
'Why are you building a fire?'

1266
01:23:58,820 --> 01:24:02,679
He looked at his younger brother and he knew!

1267
01:24:02,679 --> 01:24:07,200
He was very angry, and the people were sorry.

1268
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:14,090
The younger brother turned to the people and
shouted, 'Do we want her to die?'

1269
01:24:14,090 --> 01:24:16,639
But the people did not answer 'yes'.

1270
01:24:16,639 --> 01:24:19,659
They looked at their feet.

1271
01:24:19,659 --> 01:24:23,360
Then a little boy at the front shouted, 'No.'

1272
01:24:23,360 --> 01:24:27,389
And everybody shouted, 'No!'

1273
01:24:27,389 --> 01:24:33,050
The queen called to the white birds, 'Come
here, my brothers.'

1274
01:24:33,050 --> 01:24:36,340
The birds flew down to her feet.

1275
01:24:36,340 --> 01:24:44,030
She threw her wonderful gold coats over them
and they changed into ten fine young princes.

1276
01:24:44,030 --> 01:24:50,750
The princes took the king's brother on top
of the city walls and threw him to the ground.

1277
01:24:50,750 --> 01:24:55,380
Boys ran after them and threw stones at him.

1278
01:24:55,380 --> 01:24:58,630
Nobody saw him again.

1279
01:24:58,630 --> 01:25:02,590
The king put his arms round his queen.

1280
01:25:02,590 --> 01:25:07,500
Speak to me now, my beautiful wife.'

1281
01:25:07,500 --> 01:25:10,449
When you see white birds above you, listen.

1282
01:25:10,449 --> 01:25:14,440
You will hear them cry, 'Quickly.

1283
01:25:14,440 --> 01:25:15,660
Quickly'.

1284
01:25:15,660 --> 01:25:17,769
Now you understand.

1285
01:25:17,769 --> 01:25:18,110
- THE END -
