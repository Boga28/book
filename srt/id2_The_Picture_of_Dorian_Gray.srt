CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:03,399
An Extraordinarily Beautiful Young Man

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:06,059
The room was filled with the smell of roses.

4
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:11,419
Sitting on a sofa, smoking a cigarette, was Lord Henry Wotton.

5
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:16,180
Through the open door came the distant sounds of the London streets.

6
00:00:17,719 --> 00:00:22,479
In the centre of the room stood a portrait of an extraordinarily beautiful young man.

7
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,439
Sitting a little distance in front of it was the artist himself, Basil Hallward.

8
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:32,479
As the painter looked at the portrait, he smiled.

9
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:41,680
"It is your best work, Basil, the best thing you have ever done," said Lord Henry, slowly.

10
00:00:42,819 --> 00:00:50,219
"You really must send it next year to the Grosvenor. The Grosvenor is really the only place to exhibit a painting like that."

11
00:00:52,279 --> 00:01:01,399
"I don't think I shall send it anywhere," the painter answered, moving his head in that odd way that used to make his friends laugh at him at Oxford University.

12
00:01:02,819 --> 00:01:05,239
"No: I won't send it anywhere."

13
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:11,639
Lord Henry looked at him in surprise through the thin blue smoke of his cigarette.

14
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:19,699
"Not send it anywhere? My dear man, why not? What odd people you painters are!"

15
00:01:21,779 --> 00:01:30,219
"I know you will laugh at me," Basil replied, "but I really can't exhibit it. I have put too much of myself into it."

16
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:35,839
Lord Henry stretched himself out on the sofa and laughed.

17
00:01:36,919 --> 00:01:45,179
"Too much of yourself in it! Basil, this man is truly beautiful. He does not look like you."

18
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:50,259
"You don't understand me, Harry," answered the artist.

19
00:01:50,739 --> 00:02:03,738
"Of course I am not like him. I would be sorry to look like him. It is better not to be different from other people. The stupid and ugly have the best of this world. Dorian Gray -"

20
00:02:04,798 --> 00:02:12,118
"Dorian Gray? Is that his name?" asked Lord Henry, walking across the room towards Basil Hallward.

21
00:02:13,538 --> 00:02:16,939
"Yes, that is his name. I wasn't going to tell you."

22
00:02:18,178 --> 00:02:19,078
"But why not?"

23
00:02:20,539 --> 00:02:29,678
"Oh, I can't explain. When I like people enormously I never tell their names to anyone. I suppose you think that's very foolish?"

24
00:02:31,018 --> 00:02:51,778
"Not at all," answered Lord Henry, "not at all, my dear Basil. You forget that I am married, so my life is full of secrets. I never know where my wife is, and my wife never knows what I am doing. When we meet we tell each other lies with the most serious faces."

25
00:02:53,498 --> 00:03:00,658
"I hate the way you talk about your married life, Harry," said Basil Hallward, walking towards the door that led into the garden.

26
00:03:01,838 --> 00:03:11,378
"I believe you are really a very good husband, but that you are ashamed of it. You never say a good thing, and you never do a wrong thing."

27
00:03:13,339 --> 00:03:17,198
Lord Henry laughed and the two men went out into the garden together.

28
00:03:18,538 --> 00:03:21,458
After a pause, Lord Henry pulled out his watch.

29
00:03:23,218 --> 00:03:27,418
"I am afraid I have to go, Basil," he said in a quiet voice.

30
00:03:28,478 --> 00:03:36,998
"But before I go I want you to explain to me why you won't exhibit Dorian Grays picture. I want the real reason."

31
00:03:38,598 --> 00:03:40,178
"I told you the real reason."

32
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:48,738
"No, you did not. You said that it was because there was too much of yourself in it. Now, that is childish."

33
00:03:50,698 --> 00:04:09,377
"Harry," said Basil Hallward, looking him straight in the face, "every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not the sitter. I will not exhibit this picture because I am afraid that I have shown in it the secret of my own soul."

34
00:04:10,957 --> 00:04:11,977
Lord Henry laughed.

35
00:04:12,977 --> 00:04:15,177
"And what is that?" he asked.

36
00:04:16,357 --> 00:04:25,377
"Oh, there is really very little to tell, Harry," answered the painter, "and I don't think you will understand. Perhaps you won't believe it."

37
00:04:26,957 --> 00:04:29,898
Lord Henry smiled and picked a flower from the grass.

38
00:04:31,057 --> 00:04:38,057
"I am quite sure I'll understand it," he replied, staring at the flower," and I can believe anything."

39
00:04:41,337 --> 00:04:43,877
"The story is simply this," said the painter.

40
00:04:44,977 --> 00:05:10,297
"Two months ago I went to a party at Lady Brandon's. After I had been in the room for about ten minutes, I suddenly realized that someone was looking at me. I turned around and saw Dorian Gray for the first time. When our eyes met, I felt the blood leaving my face. I knew that this boy would become my whole soul, my whole art itself."

41
00:05:11,737 --> 00:05:12,777
"What did you do?"

42
00:05:14,337 --> 00:05:22,618
"We were quite close, almost touching. Our eyes met again. I asked Lady Brandon to introduce me to him."

43
00:05:24,298 --> 00:05:28,017
"What did Lady Brandon say about Mr Dorian Gray?"

44
00:05:29,817 --> 00:05:32,737
"Oh, something like "Charming boy.

45
00:05:32,798 --> 00:05:35,717
I don't know what he does - I think he doesn't do anything.

46
00:05:36,277 --> 00:05:40,777
Oh, yes, he plays the piano - or is it the violin, dear Mr Gray?"

47
00:05:42,517 --> 00:05:46,237
Dorian and I both laughed and we became friends at once."

48
00:05:47,717 --> 00:05:56,438
"Laughter is not at all a bad beginning for a friendship," said the young lord, picking another flower, "and it is the best ending for one."

49
00:05:58,117 --> 00:05:59,317
Hallward shook his head.

50
00:06:00,516 --> 00:06:05,396
"You don't understand what friendship is, Harry. Everyone is the same to you."

51
00:06:06,716 --> 00:06:12,216
"That's not true!" cried Lord Henry, pushing his hat back, and looking at the summer sky.

52
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:31,177
"I choose my friends for their beauty and my enemies for their intelligence. A man cannot be too careful in choosing his enemies. Of course, I hate my relations. And I hate poor people because they are ugly, stupid and drunk -"

53
00:06:31,217 --> 00:06:36,717
"I don't agree with a word you have said. And I feel sure that you don't agree either."

54
00:06:38,877 --> 00:06:44,976
Lord Henry touched his pointed brown beard with his finger, and the toe of his boot with his stick.

55
00:06:46,557 --> 00:07:00,316
"How English you are, Basil! An Englishman is only interested in whether he agrees with an idea, not whether it is right or wrong. But tell me more about Mr Dorian Gray. How often do you see him?"

56
00:07:02,036 --> 00:07:06,136
"Every day. I couldn't be happy if I didn't see him every day."

57
00:07:07,336 --> 00:07:11,537
"How extraordinary! I thought you only cared about your art."

58
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:15,896
"He is all my art to me now," said the painter.

59
00:07:16,876 --> 00:07:37,356
"I know that the work I have done since I met Dorian Gray is the best work of my life. In some strange way his personality has shown me a new kind of art. He seems like a little boy - though he is really more than twenty - and when he is with me I see the world differently."

60
00:07:38,656 --> 00:07:43,336
"Basil, this is extraordinary! I must see Dorian Gray."

61
00:07:45,556 --> 00:07:50,196
Hallward got up from his seat and walked up and down the garden.

62
00:07:50,256 --> 00:07:51,716
After some time he came back.

63
00:07:53,796 --> 00:07:55,576
"Harry," he said.

64
00:07:55,636 --> 00:08:02,795
"Dorian Gray is the reason for my art. You might see nothing in him. I see everything in him."

65
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:08,036
"Then why won't you exhibit his portrait?" asked Lord Henry.

66
00:08:09,676 --> 00:08:24,616
"An artist should paint beautiful things, but he should put nothing of his own life into them. Some day I will show the world what that beauty is. For that reason the world will never see my portrait of Dorian Gray."

67
00:08:26,775 --> 00:08:34,975
"I think you are wrong, Basil, but I won't argue with you. Tell me, is Dorian Gray very fond of you?"

68
00:08:37,035 --> 00:08:38,895
The painter thought for a few moments.

69
00:08:40,616 --> 00:08:43,595
"He likes me," he answered, after a pause.

70
00:08:44,116 --> 00:09:12,075
"I know he likes me. Of course I flatter him too much and tell him things that I should not. He is usually very charming to me, and we spend thousands of wonderful hours together. But sometimes he can be horribly thoughtless and seems to enjoy causing me pain. Then I feel, Harry, that I have given my whole soul to someone who uses it like a flower to put in his coat on a summer's day."

71
00:09:14,275 --> 00:09:18,855
"Summer days are long, Basil," said Lord Henry in a quiet voice.

72
00:09:20,095 --> 00:09:36,395
"Perhaps you will get bored before he will. Intelligence lives longer than beauty. One day you will look at your friend and you won't like his colour or something. And then you will begin to think that he has behaved badly towards you -"

73
00:09:36,435 --> 00:09:47,535
"Harry, don't talk like that. As long as I live, Dorian Gray will be everything to me. You can't feel what I feel. You change too often."

74
00:09:48,675 --> 00:09:57,976
"My dear Basil, that is exactly why I can feel it." Lord Henry took a cigarette from his pretty silver box and lit it.

75
00:09:58,075 --> 00:10:03,174
Then he turned to Hallward and said, "I have just remembered."

76
00:10:04,394 --> 00:10:05,414
"Remembered what, Harry?"

77
00:10:06,494 --> 00:10:09,255
"Where I heard the name of Dorian Gray."

78
00:10:10,994 --> 00:10:13,354
"Where was it?" asked Hallward with a frown.

79
00:10:14,574 --> 00:10:33,654
"Don't look so angry, Basil. It was at my aunt's, Lady Agatha's. She told me that she had discovered this wonderful young man. He was going to help her work with the poor people in the East End of London, and his name was Dorian Gray. Of course I didn't know it was your friend."

80
00:10:35,314 --> 00:10:37,034
"I am very glad you didn't, Harry."

81
00:10:37,894 --> 00:10:38,394
"Why?"

82
00:10:39,535 --> 00:10:40,954
"I don't want you to meet him."

83
00:10:43,374 --> 00:10:44,835
A servant came into the garden.

84
00:10:46,054 --> 00:10:49,594
"Mr Dorian Gray is waiting in the house, sir," he said.

85
00:10:51,094 --> 00:10:54,474
"You must introduce me now," cried Lord Henry, laughing.

86
00:10:56,054 --> 00:10:57,554
The painter turned to his servant.

87
00:10:58,675 --> 00:11:02,515
"Ask Mr Gray to wait, Parker. I will come in in a few moments."

88
00:11:04,335 --> 00:11:05,555
Then he looked at Lord Henry.

89
00:11:07,214 --> 00:11:10,015
"Dorian Gray is my dearest friend," he said.

90
00:11:10,474 --> 00:11:22,754
"He is a beautiful person. Don't spoil him. Don't try and influence him. Your influence would be bad. Don't take away from me the one person who makes me a true artist."

91
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:27,534
"What silly things you say!" said Lord Henry.

92
00:11:28,434 --> 00:11:32,954
Smiling, he took Hallward by the arm and almost led him into the house.

93
00:11:38,055 --> 00:11:38,814
CHAPTER TWO

94
00:11:40,414 --> 00:11:40,954
Jealous of his Own Portrait

95
00:11:40,994 --> 00:11:43,134
As they entered they saw Dorian Gray.

96
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:49,334
He was sitting at the piano, with his back to them, and he was turning the pages of some music by Schumann.

97
00:11:50,794 --> 00:11:53,654
"You must lend me these, Basil," he cried.

98
00:11:53,994 --> 00:11:56,954
"I want to learn them. They are perfectly charming."

99
00:11:58,673 --> 00:12:01,373
"Perhaps if you sit well for me today, Dorian."

100
00:12:02,213 --> 00:12:08,593
"Oh, I am bored with sitting, and I don't want a portrait of myself," answered the boy, turning quickly.

101
00:12:09,753 --> 00:12:13,113
When he saw Lord Henry, his face went red for a moment.

102
00:12:14,693 --> 00:12:18,573
"I am sorry, Basil. I didn't know that you had anyone with you."

103
00:12:20,294 --> 00:12:31,373
"This is Lord Henry Wotton, Dorian. He's an old friend of mine. We went to Oxford together. I have just been telling him what a good sitter you were, and now you have spoiled everything."

104
00:12:33,053 --> 00:12:39,833
"You have not spoiled my pleasure in meeting you, Mr Gray," said Lord Henry, stepping forward and offering his hand.

105
00:12:40,954 --> 00:12:43,413
"My aunt has often spoken to me about you."

106
00:12:45,373 --> 00:12:56,893
"I am afraid Lady Agatha is annoyed with me at the moment. I promised to go to a club in Whitechapel with her last Tuesday, and I forgot all about it. I don't know what she will say to me."

107
00:12:58,833 --> 00:12:59,993
Lord Henry looked at him.

108
00:13:01,134 --> 00:13:08,613
Yes, he was certainly wonderfully handsome, with his curved red lips, honest blue eyes and gold hair.

109
00:13:10,053 --> 00:13:18,534
"Oh, don't worry about my aunt. You are one of her favourite people. And you are too charming to waste time working tor poor people."

110
00:13:20,534 --> 00:13:24,134
Lord Henry sat down on the sofa and opened his cigarette box.

111
00:13:25,113 --> 00:13:28,653
The painter was busy mixing colours and getting his brushes ready.

112
00:13:30,093 --> 00:13:42,193
Suddenly, he looked at Lord Henry and said, "Harry, I want to finish this picture today. Would you think it very rude of me if I asked you to go away?"

113
00:13:42,273 --> 00:13:46,453
Lord Henry smiled, and looked at Dorian Gray.

114
00:13:46,513 --> 00:13:51,333
"Shall I go, Mr Gray?" he asked.

115
00:13:51,393 --> 00:14:02,632
"Oh, please don't, Lord Henry. I see that Basil is in one of his difficult moods, and I hate it when he is difficult. And I want you to tell me why I should not help the poor people."

116
00:14:04,432 --> 00:14:17,872
"That would be very boring, Mr Gray. But I certainly will not run away if you do not want me to. Is that all right, Basil? You have often told me that you like your sitters to have someone to talk to."

117
00:14:19,993 --> 00:14:21,172
Hallward bit his lip.

118
00:14:23,012 --> 00:14:27,952
"If that is what Dorian wants. Dorian always gets what he wants."

119
00:14:30,093 --> 00:14:32,253
Lord Henry picked up his hat and gloves.

120
00:14:33,052 --> 00:14:41,872
"No, I am afraid I must go. Goodbye, Mr Gray. Come and see me one afternoon in Curzon Street. I am nearly always at home at five o'clock."

121
00:14:43,812 --> 00:14:56,532
"Basil," cried Dorian Gray, "If Lord Henry Wotton goes, I will go too. You never open your lips while you are painting, and it is horribly boring just standing here. Ask him to stay."

122
00:14:58,752 --> 00:15:05,393
"All right, please stay, Harry. For Dorian and for me," said Hallward, staring at his picture.

123
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:23,912
"It is true that I never talk when I am working, and never listen either. It must be very boring for my sitters. Sit down again, Harry. And Dorian don't move about too much, or listen to what Lord Henry says. He has a very bad influence over all his friends."

124
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:29,612
Dorian Gray stood while Hallward finished his portrait.

125
00:15:30,753 --> 00:15:32,672
He liked what he had seen of Lord Henry.

126
00:15:33,293 --> 00:15:35,812
He was so different to Basil!

127
00:15:35,872 --> 00:15:38,912
And he had such a beautiful voice.

128
00:15:39,073 --> 00:15:46,632
After a few moments he said to him, "Have you really a very bad influence, Lord Henry? As bad as Basil says?"

129
00:15:47,992 --> 00:15:49,732
"Influence is always bad."

130
00:15:51,332 --> 00:15:51,492
"Why?"

131
00:15:52,712 --> 00:15:59,032
"Because to influence someone is to give them your soul. Each person must have his own personality."

132
00:16:00,911 --> 00:16:04,091
"Turn your head a little more to the right, Dorian," said the painter.

133
00:16:04,931 --> 00:16:10,051
He was not listening to the conversation and only knew that there was a new look on the boy's face.

134
00:16:12,491 --> 00:16:40,791
"And yet," continued Lord Henry, in his low musical voice, "I believe that if one man lived his life fully and completely he could change the world. He would be a work of art greater than anything we have ever imagined. But the bravest man among us is afraid of himself. You, Mr Gray, are very young but you have had passions that have made you afraid, dreams -"

135
00:16:40,811 --> 00:16:47,491
"Stop!" cried Dorian Gray, "I don't understand what you are saying. I need to think."

136
00:16:49,871 --> 00:16:55,451
For nearly ten minutes he stood there with his lips open and his eyes strangely bright.

137
00:16:56,771 --> 00:17:00,172
The words that Basil's friend had spoken had touched his soul.

138
00:17:01,571 --> 00:17:05,732
Yes, there had been things in his boyhood that he had not understood.

139
00:17:07,052 --> 00:17:08,291
He understood them now.

140
00:17:10,771 --> 00:17:13,111
With his smile, Lord Henry watched him.

141
00:17:13,552 --> 00:17:16,191
He knew the exact moment when to say nothing.

142
00:17:17,111 --> 00:17:20,151
He was surprised at the sudden effect of his words on the boy.

143
00:17:21,631 --> 00:17:23,491
How fascinating the boy was!

144
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:29,311
Hallward continued painting and did not notice that the others were silent.

145
00:17:32,031 --> 00:17:35,531
"Basil, I am tired," cried Dorian Gray, suddenly.

146
00:17:36,391 --> 00:17:39,531
"I must go and sit in the garden. There is no air in here."

147
00:17:41,271 --> 00:18:00,070
"My dear boy, I am sorry. When I am painting, my work is all I can think about. But you never sat better. I don't know what Harry has been saying to you, but there is a wonderful bright look in your eyes. I suppose he has been flattering you. You shouldn't believe a word he says."

148
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:07,850
"He has certainly not been flattering me. Perhaps that is why I don't believe anything he has told me."

149
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:15,430
"You know you believe it all," said Lord Henry, looking at him with his dreamy eyes.

150
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:21,290
"I will go out to the garden with you. It's horribly hot in this room."

151
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:25,850
"Don't keep Dorian too long," said the painter.

152
00:18:26,571 --> 00:18:28,490
"This is going to be my best painting."

153
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:36,930
Lord Henry went out to the garden, and found Dorian Gray holding a flower to his face.

154
00:18:38,131 --> 00:18:41,270
He came close to him, and put his hand on his shoulder.

155
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:45,190
Dorian Gray frowned and turned away.

156
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:49,390
He liked the tall young man who was standing by him.

157
00:18:50,311 --> 00:18:52,910
His dark, romantic face interested him.

158
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:57,010
There was something in his low, musical voice that was fascinating.

159
00:18:58,370 --> 00:18:59,950
But he felt a little afraid.

160
00:19:01,131 --> 00:19:04,510
Why was this stranger having a strong influence on him like this?

161
00:19:05,491 --> 00:19:10,531
He had known Basil Hallward for months, but the friendship between them had not changed him.

162
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:15,390
Suddenly someone had come into his life and turned it upside down.

163
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:19,550
Someone who seemed to have the key to the mystery of life itself.

164
00:19:21,631 --> 00:19:24,070
And yet, what was there to be afraid of?

165
00:19:24,811 --> 00:19:27,410
He was not a schoolboy or a girl.

166
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:28,930
It was silly to be afraid.

167
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:36,670
"Let us go and sit out of the sun. I don't want you to be burnt by the sun."

168
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:44,030
"What does that matter?" cried Dorian Gray, laughing as he sat down on the seat at the end of the garden.

169
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:48,010
"It should matter very much to you, Mr Gray."

170
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:49,810
"Why?"

171
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:55,010
"Because you are young, and to be young is the best thing in the world."

172
00:19:56,649 --> 00:19:58,089
"I don't feel that, Lord Henry."

173
00:19:59,129 --> 00:20:16,729
"No, you don't feel it now. Some day when you are old and ugly you will feel it terribly. Now, wherever you go, you charm the world. Will it always be so?... You have a wonderfully beautiful face, Mr Gray."

174
00:20:18,269 --> 00:20:19,250
"I don't think -"

175
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:37,989
"Don't frown. It is true. The gods have been good to you. But what the gods give they quickly take away. You have only a few years in which to really live, perfectly and fully. Live your life now, while you are still young!"

176
00:20:40,869 --> 00:20:44,349
Suddenly the painter appeared at the door and waved at them to come in.

177
00:20:45,309 --> 00:20:47,289
They turned to each other and smiled.

178
00:20:49,149 --> 00:20:50,769
"I am waiting," he cried.

179
00:20:51,529 --> 00:20:54,049
"Please come in. The light is perfect."

180
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:58,129
They got up and walked towards the house together.

181
00:21:00,169 --> 00:21:04,489
"You are glad you have met me, Mr Gray," said Lord Henry, looking at him.

182
00:21:05,809 --> 00:21:10,470
"Yes, I am glad now. I wonder whether I will always be glad."

183
00:21:11,409 --> 00:21:16,250
"Always! That is a terrible word. Women are so fond of using it."

184
00:21:19,509 --> 00:21:22,809
Twenty minutes later Hallward stopped painting.

185
00:21:22,869 --> 00:21:25,430
He stood back and looked at the portrait for a few moments.

186
00:21:26,349 --> 00:21:30,829
Then he bent down and signed his name in red paint on the bottom left-hand corner.

187
00:21:32,969 --> 00:21:34,729
"It is finished," he cried.

188
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:38,529
Lord Henry came over and examined the picture.

189
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:41,429
It was certainly a wonderful work of art.

190
00:21:43,169 --> 00:21:45,309
"My dear man," he said.

191
00:21:45,709 --> 00:21:51,809
"It is the best portrait of our time. Mr Gray, come over and look at yourself."

192
00:21:51,889 --> 00:21:53,789
Dorian walked across to look at the painting.

193
00:21:54,829 --> 00:21:57,468
When he saw it his cheeks went red with pleasure.

194
00:21:58,488 --> 00:22:01,628
He felt that he recognized his own beauty for the first time.

195
00:22:03,028 --> 00:22:05,389
But then he remembered what Lord Henry had said.

196
00:22:06,389 --> 00:22:09,248
His beauty would only be there for a few years.

197
00:22:10,268 --> 00:22:13,028
One day he would be old and ugly.

198
00:22:15,349 --> 00:22:19,808
"Don't you like it?" cried Hallward, not understanding why the boy was silent.

199
00:22:20,929 --> 00:22:23,509
"Of course he likes it," said Lord Henry.

200
00:22:24,308 --> 00:22:31,049
"It is one of the greatest paintings in modern art. I will pay anything you ask for it. I must have it."

201
00:22:33,049 --> 00:22:34,868
"It is not mine to sell, Harry."

202
00:22:35,849 --> 00:22:36,588
"Whose is it?"

203
00:22:38,088 --> 00:22:40,408
"Dorian's, of course," answered the painter.

204
00:22:41,968 --> 00:22:43,388
"He is very lucky."

205
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:50,588
"How sad it is!" said Dorian Gray, who was still staring at his own portrait.

206
00:22:51,869 --> 00:23:03,229
"I will grow old and horrible. But this painting will always stay young. It will never be older than this day in June... if only it were the other way!"

207
00:23:05,168 --> 00:23:07,028
"What do you mean?" asked Hallward.

208
00:23:08,568 --> 00:23:23,148
"If I could stay young and the picture grow old! For that - for that - I would give everything! Yes, there is nothing in the whole world I would not give! I would give my soul for that!"

209
00:23:24,568 --> 00:23:28,248
"I don't think you would like that, Basil," cried Lord Henry, laughing.

210
00:23:29,308 --> 00:23:31,908
"I certainly would not, Harry," said Hallward.

211
00:23:33,788 --> 00:23:35,608
Dorian Gray turned and looked at him.

212
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:38,928
"You like your art better than your friends."

213
00:23:40,408 --> 00:23:42,028
The painter stared in surprise.

214
00:23:42,869 --> 00:23:44,549
Why was Dorian speaking like that?

215
00:23:45,448 --> 00:23:46,068
What had happened?

216
00:23:46,408 --> 00:23:49,068
His face was red, and he seemed quite angry.

217
00:23:50,748 --> 00:24:07,468
"You will always like this painting. But how long will you like me? Until I start getting old. Lord Henry Wotton is perfectly right. When I lose my beauty, I will lose everything. I shall kill myself before I get old."

218
00:24:09,027 --> 00:24:11,807
Hallward turned white, and caught his hand.

219
00:24:12,867 --> 00:24:14,947
"Dorian! Dorian!" he cried.

220
00:24:15,568 --> 00:24:26,968
"Don't talk like that. I have never had a friend like you, and I will never have another. How can you be jealous of a painting? You are more beautiful than any work of art."

221
00:24:28,707 --> 00:24:44,488
"I am jealous of everything whose beauty does not die. I am jealous of the portrait you have painted of me. Why should it keep what I must lose?" Hot tears came into his eyes as he threw himself on the sofa.

222
00:24:46,267 --> 00:24:49,167
"You did this, Harry," said the painter, angrily.

223
00:24:50,808 --> 00:24:52,187
Lord Henry shook his head.

224
00:24:53,848 --> 00:24:57,247
"It is the real Dorian Gray - that is all."

225
00:24:59,468 --> 00:25:09,747
"Harry, I can't argue with two of my best friends at once. Between you both you have made me hate the best piece of work I have ever done. I will destroy it."

226
00:25:11,487 --> 00:25:16,247
Dorian Gray watched as Hallward walked over to the painting- table and picked up a knife.

227
00:25:17,387 --> 00:25:23,227
The boy jumped from the sofa, tore the knife from Hallward's hand and threw it across the room.

228
00:25:24,207 --> 00:25:26,027
"Don't, Basil!" he cried.

229
00:25:26,387 --> 00:25:27,527
"Don't murder it!"

230
00:25:30,167 --> 00:25:34,868
"I am glad that you like my work at last, Dorian," said the painter coldly.

231
00:25:35,947 --> 00:25:37,207
"I never thought you would."

232
00:25:38,707 --> 00:25:45,527
"Like it? I am in love with it, Basil. It is part of myself. I feel that."

233
00:25:47,508 --> 00:25:51,367
"What silly people you are, both of you!" said Lord Henry.

234
00:25:52,527 --> 00:25:56,466
"Let's forget about the painting for one night and go to the theatre."

235
00:25:58,366 --> 00:26:00,926
"I would like to come to the theatre with you, Lord Henry."

236
00:26:02,206 --> 00:26:04,327
"And you will come too, won't you Basil?"

237
00:26:05,786 --> 00:26:07,266
"I can't," said Hallward.

238
00:26:07,886 --> 00:26:09,306
"I have too much work to do."

239
00:26:11,046 --> 00:26:14,606
"Well, you and I will go together, Mr Gray."

240
00:26:16,886 --> 00:26:20,306
The painter bit his lip and walked over to the picture.

241
00:26:22,466 --> 00:26:27,366
"I will stay with the real Dorian," he said sadly.

242
00:26:31,846 --> 00:26:32,646
CHAPTER THREE

243
00:26:35,846 --> 00:26:35,866
Dorian in Love

244
00:26:35,907 --> 00:26:42,506
One afternoon, a month later, Dorian Gray was sitting in the little library of Lord Henry's house in Mayfair.

245
00:26:43,526 --> 00:26:45,286
Lord Henry had not yet come in.

246
00:26:46,186 --> 00:26:47,306
He was always late.

247
00:26:48,226 --> 00:26:52,266
Dorian Gray was bored and once or twice he thought of going away.

248
00:26:53,646 --> 00:26:57,026
At last he heard a step outside and the door opened.

249
00:26:58,226 --> 00:27:00,666
"How late you are, Harry!" he said.

250
00:27:02,406 --> 00:27:06,346
"I'm afraid it is not Harry, Mr Gray. It is only his wife."

251
00:27:07,806 --> 00:27:09,946
He looked around quickly and got to his feet.

252
00:27:10,787 --> 00:27:13,666
"I am sorry. I thought -"

253
00:27:13,747 --> 00:27:18,586
"I know you quite well by your photographs. I think my husband has got seventeen of them."

254
00:27:20,107 --> 00:27:21,726
"Seventeen, Lady Henry?"

255
00:27:22,787 --> 00:27:29,666
"Well, eighteen, then. And I saw you with him the other night at the theatre. But here is Harry!"

256
00:27:31,366 --> 00:27:32,967
Lord Henry smiled at them both.

257
00:27:34,067 --> 00:27:35,966
"So sorry I am late, Dorian."

258
00:27:37,467 --> 00:27:39,826
"I am afraid I must go," said Lady Harry.

259
00:27:40,466 --> 00:27:48,126
"Goodbye, Mr Gray. Goodbye, Harry. You are eating out, I suppose? I am too. Perhaps I will see you later."

260
00:27:49,567 --> 00:27:53,146
"Perhaps, my dear," said Lord Harry, shutting the door behind her.

261
00:27:54,586 --> 00:27:57,425
Then he lit a cigarette and threw himself down on the sofa.

262
00:27:59,425 --> 00:28:02,966
"Never marry a woman with fair hair, Dorian," he said.

263
00:28:04,085 --> 00:28:04,866
"Why, Harry?"

264
00:28:05,946 --> 00:28:07,265
"Because they are romantic."

265
00:28:08,866 --> 00:28:10,325
"But I like romantic people."

266
00:28:11,665 --> 00:28:13,786
"Never marry at all, Dorian."

267
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:19,225
"I don't think I will marry, Harry. I am too much in love."

268
00:28:21,245 --> 00:28:24,805
"Who are you in love with?" asked Lord Henry, after a pause.

269
00:28:26,645 --> 00:28:29,066
"With an actress," said Dorian Gray.

270
00:28:30,206 --> 00:28:31,425
"How ordinary."

271
00:28:32,485 --> 00:28:34,945
"You would not say that if you saw her, Harry."

272
00:28:36,526 --> 00:28:37,345
"Who is she?"

273
00:28:38,706 --> 00:28:40,505
"Her name is Sibyl Vane."

274
00:28:41,726 --> 00:28:42,885
"I've never heard of her."

275
00:28:42,985 --> 00:28:49,045
"No one has. People will some day, though. She is an artist."

276
00:28:50,225 --> 00:29:00,765
"My dear boy, no woman is an artist. Women never have anything to say but they say it charmingly. How long have you known her?"

277
00:29:01,985 --> 00:29:03,145
"About three weeks."

278
00:29:04,445 --> 00:29:05,606
"And where did you meet her?"

279
00:29:06,706 --> 00:29:28,386
"I will tell you, Harry, but you must not laugh. After all, it was you who gave me a passion to know everything about life. For days after I met you I searched the streets for beauty. I walked around the East End until I found a dirty little theatre. I see you are laughing. It is horrible of you!"

280
00:29:29,845 --> 00:29:33,265
"I am not laughing, Dorian. Go on with your story."

281
00:29:34,765 --> 00:29:55,745
"The play was Romeo and Juliet. At first I was annoyed at the thought of seeing Shakespeare in such a terrible place. And when a fat old gentleman came out as Romeo I nearly walked out. But then I saw Juliet! Harry, she was the loveliest thing I had ever seen in my

282
00:29:55,805 --> 00:29:55,985
life."

283
00:29:57,964 --> 00:29:59,124
"When did you meet her?"

284
00:30:00,564 --> 00:30:07,684
"I went back the next night and the night after that. On the third evening I waited for her outside the theatre."

285
00:30:09,084 --> 00:30:10,044
"What was she like?"

286
00:30:11,264 --> 00:30:21,985
"Sibyl? Oh, she was shy and gentle. She is only seventeen and there is something of a child in her. She said to me, "You look like a prince.

287
00:30:22,624 --> 00:30:24,104
I must call you Prince Charming"."

288
00:30:25,784 --> 00:30:27,944
"Miss Sibyl knows how to flatter you."

289
00:30:28,964 --> 00:30:39,684
"You don't understand her, Harry. She thinks that I am like a person in Shakespeare. She knows nothing of life. Sibyl is the only thing I care about."

290
00:30:41,364 --> 00:30:47,464
"That is the reason, I suppose, that you never have dinner with me now. I thought it might be something romantic."

291
00:30:49,044 --> 00:30:52,744
"My dear Harry, we eat together every day," said Dorian.

292
00:30:53,544 --> 00:30:55,444
"You always come very late."

293
00:30:56,444 --> 00:30:59,364
"Well, I have to see Sibyl play," he cried.

294
00:31:01,124 --> 00:31:03,244
"Can you have dinner with me tonight, Dorian?"

295
00:31:04,684 --> 00:31:05,464
He shook his head.

296
00:31:06,444 --> 00:31:10,684
"Tonight she is Ophelia," he answered, "and tomorrow night she will be Juliet."

297
00:31:12,144 --> 00:31:14,044
"When is she Sibyl Vane?"

298
00:31:15,284 --> 00:31:15,684
"Never."

299
00:31:17,084 --> 00:31:17,824
"That's good."

300
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:29,584
"How horrible you are! But when you see her you will think differently. I want you and Basil to come and watch her tomorrow night. You are certain to recognize that she is wonderful."

301
00:31:31,224 --> 00:31:37,124
"All right. Tomorrow evening. Will you see Basil before then? Or shall I write to him?"

302
00:31:38,205 --> 00:31:55,663
"Dear Basil! I haven't seen him for a week. It is rather horrible of me as he sent me my portrait a few days ago. I love looking at it. Perhaps you should write to him. I don't want to see him alone. He says things that annoy me. He gives me good advice."

303
00:31:57,463 --> 00:31:58,604
Lord Henry smiled.

304
00:31:59,784 --> 00:32:03,584
"People are very fond of giving away advice they need themselves."

305
00:32:04,523 --> 00:32:14,183
"Oh, Basil is a good man, but I don't think he really understands about art and beauty. Since I have known you, Harry, I have discovered that."

306
00:32:15,544 --> 00:32:20,443
"Basil, my dear boy, puts everything that is charming in him into his work."

307
00:32:22,124 --> 00:32:29,263
"I must go now, Harry. My Juliet is waiting for me. Don't forget about tomorrow. Goodbye."

308
00:32:32,323 --> 00:32:36,643
As Dorian left the room, Lord Henry began to think about what he had just learned.

309
00:32:37,643 --> 00:32:41,663
Certainly few people had ever interested him so much as Dorian Gray.

310
00:32:42,803 --> 00:32:47,243
Yet the mad worship of this actress did not make him annoyed or jealous.

311
00:32:48,063 --> 00:32:49,123
He was pleased by it.

312
00:32:50,003 --> 00:32:52,163
It made the boy more interesting to study.

313
00:32:54,423 --> 00:33:00,123
Later that night, when he arrived home from dinner, Lord Henry saw a telegram on the table near the door.

314
00:33:00,944 --> 00:33:05,683
He opened it and read that Dorian Gray was going to marry Sibyl Vane.

315
00:33:10,563 --> 00:33:13,463
CHAPTER FOUR

316
00:33:13,503 --> 00:33:14,003
The Worship of Sibyl Vane

317
00:33:14,044 --> 00:33:17,923
"I suppose you have heard the news, Basil?" said Lord Henry the following evening.

318
00:33:18,743 --> 00:33:20,963
They were in the dining-room of the Bristol Hotel.

319
00:33:22,423 --> 00:33:26,423
"No, Harry," answered the artist, giving his hat and coat to the waiter.

320
00:33:27,503 --> 00:33:28,084
"What is it?"

321
00:33:29,023 --> 00:33:34,404
"Dorian Gray is going to be married," said Lord Henry, watching him as he spoke.

322
00:33:35,764 --> 00:33:37,763
Hallward frowned.

323
00:33:37,823 --> 00:33:40,003
"Dorian going to be married!" he cried.

324
00:33:40,724 --> 00:33:41,544
"Impossible!"

325
00:33:42,463 --> 00:33:43,803
"It is perfectly true."

326
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:45,603
"To whom?"

327
00:33:46,203 --> 00:33:47,584
"To some little actress."

328
00:33:49,803 --> 00:33:52,823
"But it would be absurd for him to marry someone like that."

329
00:33:54,383 --> 00:34:06,262
"If you want to make him marry this girl tell him that, Basil. He is sure to do it, then. Whenever a man does a completely stupid thing, it is always for a good reason."

330
00:34:07,682 --> 00:34:09,642
"I hope this girl is good, Harry."

331
00:34:10,842 --> 00:34:15,522
"Oh, she is better than good - she is beautiful," said Lord Henry.

332
00:34:16,222 --> 00:34:29,702
"Dorian says that she is beautiful and he is not often wrong about these things. Your portrait has helped him understand beauty in others. We are to see her tonight, if that boy doesn't forget."

333
00:34:31,142 --> 00:34:39,562
"But how can Dorian marry an actress, Harry? It is absurd," cried the painter, walking up and down the room, biting his lip.

334
00:34:41,322 --> 00:34:59,022
"Dorian Gray falls in love with a beautiful actress who plays Juliet. He asks her to marry him. Why not? I hope that Dorian Gray marries this girl and worships her for six months. Then he can suddenly become fascinated by another woman."

335
00:35:00,482 --> 00:35:09,323
"You don't mean a word of that, Harry! I know you don't really want Dorian Gray's life to be spoiled. You are much better than you pretend to be."

336
00:35:11,283 --> 00:35:12,342
Lord Henry laughed.

337
00:35:13,442 --> 00:35:24,162
"The reason we all like to think so well of others is because we are afraid for ourselves. But here is Dorian himself. He will tell you more than I can."

338
00:35:25,243 --> 00:35:38,822
"My dear Harry, my dear Basil, you must both congratulate me!" said the boy, throwing off his coat and shaking each of his friends" hands. "I have never been so happy.

339
00:35:38,902 --> 00:35:42,282
Of course it is sudden - all the best things are.

340
00:35:42,963 --> 00:35:49,442
And yet it seems to me to be the one thing I have been looking for all my life."

341
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:57,221
"I hope you will always be very happy, Dorian," said Hallward, "but why did you not tell me? You told Harry."

342
00:35:59,241 --> 00:36:01,801
"There really is not much to tell," cried Dorian.

343
00:36:02,461 --> 00:36:20,181
"Last night I went to see her again. After, when we were sitting together, there came into her eyes a wonderful look. It was something I had never seen there before. We kissed each other. I can't describe to you what I felt at that moment."

344
00:36:21,861 --> 00:36:24,542
"Have you seen her today?" asked Lord Henry.

345
00:36:25,681 --> 00:36:27,021
Dorian Gray shook his head.

346
00:36:28,062 --> 00:36:32,421
"I have left her in Shakespeare's forest. I will find her in his garden."

347
00:36:34,382 --> 00:36:42,761
"At what exact point did you use the word "marry", Dorian? And how did she answer? Perhaps you forgot all about it."

348
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:53,141
"My dear Harry, it was not a business meeting. I told her I loved her. The whole world is nothing to me compared to her."

349
00:36:54,961 --> 00:36:57,382
"But my dear Dorian -"

350
00:36:57,481 --> 00:36:59,782
Hallward put his hand on Lord Henry's arm.

351
00:37:00,761 --> 00:37:07,602
"Don't Harry. You have annoyed Dorian. He is not like other men. He would never harm anyone."

352
00:37:09,621 --> 00:37:11,261
Lord Henry looked across the table.

353
00:37:12,201 --> 00:37:15,081
"Dorian is never annoyed with me," he answered.

354
00:37:16,661 --> 00:37:17,701
Dorian Gray laughed.

355
00:37:18,661 --> 00:37:25,981
"When I am with Sibyl Vane I don't believe in anything you have taught me. I forget all your fascinating, terrible ideas."

356
00:37:27,721 --> 00:37:32,201
"And those are... ?" asked Lord Henry, helping himself to some salad.

357
00:37:33,202 --> 00:37:40,281
"Oh, your ideas about life, your ideas about love, your ideas about pleasure. All your ideas, Harry."

358
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:48,401
"Pleasure is the only thing worth having ideas about," he answered, in his slow, musical voice.

359
00:37:49,341 --> 00:37:56,040
"When we are happy we are always good, but when we are good we are not always happy."

360
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:00,760
"I know what pleasure is," cried Dorian Gray.

361
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:03,060
"It is to worship someone."

362
00:38:04,861 --> 00:38:07,960
"That is certainly better than when someone worships you."

363
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:20,120
"Harry, you are terrible! I don't know why I like you so much. Let us go down to the theatre. When you see Sibyl you will change your ideas."

364
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:24,120
They got up and put on their coats.

365
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:27,100
The painter was silent and thoughtful.

366
00:38:28,081 --> 00:38:29,220
He felt very sad.

367
00:38:30,601 --> 00:38:35,120
Dorian Gray would never again be to him all that he had been in the past.

368
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:37,800
Life had come between them.

369
00:38:39,901 --> 00:38:45,540
When he arrived at the theatre it seemed to Hallward that he had grown years older.

370
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:50,480
CHAPTER FIVE

371
00:38:52,719 --> 00:38:52,739
Dorian Leaves Sibyl

372
00:38:52,739 --> 00:38:54,419
The theatre was crowded that night.

373
00:38:55,279 --> 00:39:00,079
It was terribly hot and there were young people shouting to each other from across seats.

374
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:04,419
Women were laughing loudly and their voices sounded horrible.

375
00:39:05,279 --> 00:39:08,199
People were eating oranges and drinking from bottles.

376
00:39:10,039 --> 00:39:13,999
"What a place to find the perfect girl in!" said Lord Henry.

377
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:17,139
"Yes!" answered Dorian Gray.

378
00:39:17,779 --> 00:39:26,939
"It was here I found her. When you see her as Juliet you will forget everything. These ugly people become quite different when she appears."

379
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:37,000
"I understand what you mean, Dorian," said the painter, "and I believe in this girl. Anyone you love must be wonderful."

380
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,819
"Thanks, Basil," answered Dorian Gray.

381
00:39:41,799 --> 00:39:51,979
"I knew that you would understand me. In a few minutes you will see the girl who I am going to give my life to. The girl who I have given everything that is good in me."

382
00:39:54,619 --> 00:39:56,000
Then Sibyl appeared.

383
00:39:56,899 --> 00:40:00,560
The crowd shouted and called her name.

384
00:40:00,619 --> 00:40:04,279
Yes, she was certainly lovely to look at, Lord Henry thought.

385
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,559
Basil Hallward jumped to his feet excitedly.

386
00:40:08,979 --> 00:40:12,739
Dorian Gray sat staring at her like he was in a dream.

387
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:17,599
"Charming! Charming!" cried Lord Henry.

388
00:40:20,119 --> 00:40:24,859
A quarter of an hour later, Lord Henry whispered to Hallward.

389
00:40:24,919 --> 00:40:31,200
"She's one of the loveliest girls I have ever seen. But she is a terrible actress."

390
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:37,099
Dorian Gray's face turned white as he watched her speak.

391
00:40:37,999 --> 00:40:39,619
She was so different tonight!

392
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:48,099
Now she was not Juliet but a very bad actress who did not understand Shakespeare's words.

393
00:40:48,259 --> 00:40:51,098
Even the crowd became bored and began to talk loudly.

394
00:40:52,518 --> 00:40:56,118
The only person who did not seem to notice was the actress herself.

395
00:40:58,459 --> 00:41:01,439
Lord Henry got up from his chair and put on his coat.

396
00:41:02,758 --> 00:41:08,338
"She is beautiful, Dorian," he said, "but she can't act. Let's go."

397
00:41:10,138 --> 00:41:15,178
"I am going to stay until the end," answered the boy in a cold voice.

398
00:41:16,258 --> 00:41:21,538
"I am awfully sorry that I have made you waste an evening, Harry. I apologize to you both."

399
00:41:23,179 --> 00:41:27,019
"My dear Dorian, perhaps Miss Vane is ill," said Hallward.

400
00:41:27,618 --> 00:41:29,038
"We will come some other night."

401
00:41:31,278 --> 00:41:41,778
"Come to the club with Basil and myself. We will smoke cigarettes and drink to the beauty of Sibyl Vane. She is beautiful. What more do you want?"

402
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:45,659
"Go away, Harry," cried the boy.

403
00:41:46,458 --> 00:41:56,358
"I want to be alone. Can't you see my heart is breaking?" Hot tears came to his eyes as Lord Henry and Hallward left the theatre.

404
00:41:58,938 --> 00:42:02,538
When it was over, Dorian Gray rushed to see Sibyl Vane.

405
00:42:04,059 --> 00:42:09,159
The girl was standing there alone, with a look of extraordinary happiness on her face.

406
00:42:11,019 --> 00:42:14,238
"How badly I acted tonight, Dorian!" she cried.

407
00:42:15,618 --> 00:42:17,938
"Horribly!" he answered, staring at her.

408
00:42:18,538 --> 00:42:23,318
"It was terrible. Are you ill? Why did you make me suffer like that?"

409
00:42:24,839 --> 00:42:26,798
The girl smiled.

410
00:42:26,858 --> 00:42:30,378
"Dorian, don't yon understand?"

411
00:42:30,458 --> 00:42:32,898
"Understand what?" he asked, angrily.

412
00:42:34,298 --> 00:42:40,558
"Why I was so bad tonight. Why I will always be bad. Why I will never act well again."

413
00:42:42,318 --> 00:42:48,998
"You are ill, I suppose. When you are ill, you shouldn't act. My friends were bored. I was bored."

414
00:42:50,377 --> 00:43:16,157
"Dorian, Dorian," she cried, "before I knew you, acting was the one important thing in my life. It was only in the theatre that I lived. I thought that it was all true. Tonight, for the first time in my life I saw that I was playing at love. Our love for each other is the only true love. Take me away with you, Dorian! I don't want to be an actress any more."

415
00:43:18,717 --> 00:43:22,217
He threw himself down on the sofa, and turned away his face.

416
00:43:23,657 --> 00:43:26,178
"You have killed my love," he said quietly.

417
00:43:27,198 --> 00:43:28,757
Then he jumped up and went to the door.

418
00:43:29,917 --> 00:43:42,297
"My God! How mad I was to love you! What a fool I have been! You are nothing to me now. I will never see you again. I will never think of you. I will never speak to you again."

419
00:43:44,057 --> 00:43:45,277
The girl went white.

420
00:43:46,397 --> 00:43:53,237
"You are not serious, Dorian? You are acting?" she whispered, putting her hand on his arm.

421
00:43:54,538 --> 00:43:55,397
He pushed her back.

422
00:43:56,017 --> 00:43:57,758
"Don't touch me!" he cried.

423
00:43:58,557 --> 00:44:00,398
Then he turned and left the room.

424
00:44:04,237 --> 00:44:09,837
After walking the streets of London all night, he arrived home just after sunrise.

425
00:44:09,898 --> 00:44:14,998
As he passed through the library, he saw the portrait that Basil Hallward had painted of him.

426
00:44:16,017 --> 00:44:20,998
He stared at it in surprise and walked on into his bedroom.

427
00:44:21,057 --> 00:44:23,697
He took his coat off and stood next to his bed.

428
00:44:25,297 --> 00:44:28,977
A few moments later he returned to the picture and looked at it closely.

429
00:44:30,358 --> 00:44:34,857
In the poor light the face seemed to have changed a little.

430
00:44:34,917 --> 00:44:36,657
Now the mouth looked cruel.

431
00:44:38,237 --> 00:44:39,557
It was certainly strange.

432
00:44:41,617 --> 00:44:43,637
He walked to the window and opened the curtains.

433
00:44:44,597 --> 00:44:48,837
The light changed the room, but the face stayed the same.

434
00:44:48,937 --> 00:44:53,357
In fact, the sunlight made the mouth look even crueller.

435
00:44:55,556 --> 00:45:00,297
Going back to his bedroom, he found a small mirror that had been a present from Lord Henry.

436
00:45:01,436 --> 00:45:05,336
He looked at his real face and saw no sign of cruelty.

437
00:45:07,316 --> 00:45:08,256
What did it mean?

438
00:45:10,776 --> 00:45:13,297
He threw himself into a chair, and began to think.

439
00:45:15,076 --> 00:45:20,276
Suddenly he remembered what he had said in Basil Hallward's house the day the picture had been finished.

440
00:45:21,797 --> 00:45:24,056
Yes, he remembered it perfectly.

441
00:45:25,256 --> 00:45:29,817
He had asked that the painting grow old so that he himself could remain young.

442
00:45:31,196 --> 00:45:32,896
But such things were impossible.

443
00:45:33,996 --> 00:45:35,856
It was terrible even to think about them.

444
00:45:37,616 --> 00:45:40,696
And, yet, there was the picture in front of him.

445
00:45:41,876 --> 00:45:43,616
There was the cruelty in the mouth.

446
00:45:45,356 --> 00:45:46,136
Cruelty!

447
00:45:47,297 --> 00:45:48,236
Had he been cruel?

448
00:45:49,797 --> 00:45:51,996
No, why think about Sibyl Vane?

449
00:45:52,596 --> 00:45:53,856
She was nothing to him now.

450
00:45:55,717 --> 00:45:56,496
But the picture?

451
00:45:57,457 --> 00:45:58,796
What was he to say of that?

452
00:45:59,756 --> 00:46:03,176
It held the secret of his life, and told his story.

453
00:46:03,896 --> 00:46:06,076
It had taught him to love his own beauty.

454
00:46:07,317 --> 00:46:10,796
Would it teach him to hate his own soul?

455
00:46:10,857 --> 00:46:12,216
Would he ever look at it again?

456
00:46:14,696 --> 00:46:15,836
He would save himself!

457
00:46:16,416 --> 00:46:18,137
He would not see Lord Henry again.

458
00:46:18,857 --> 00:46:23,096
He would go back to Sibyl Vane, marry her and try to love her again.

459
00:46:24,236 --> 00:46:25,976
She had suffered more than he had.

460
00:46:26,756 --> 00:46:28,677
Poor child!

461
00:46:28,736 --> 00:46:30,677
He had been selfish and cruel to her.

462
00:46:31,796 --> 00:46:32,936
They would be happy together.

463
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:36,116
His life with her would be beautiful and pure.

464
00:46:38,156 --> 00:46:40,596
He got up from his chair, and covered the portrait.

465
00:46:41,836 --> 00:46:47,016
"How horrible!" he said to himself, and he walked across to the window and opened it.

466
00:46:48,815 --> 00:46:51,815
When he stepped out on to the grass he took a deep breath.

467
00:46:52,895 --> 00:46:54,135
He thought only of Sibyl.

468
00:46:55,175 --> 00:46:59,155
The birds that were singing in the garden seemed to be telling the flowers about her.

469
00:47:04,215 --> 00:47:05,055
CHAPTER SIX

470
00:47:07,894 --> 00:47:07,914
Love Becomes Tragedy

471
00:47:07,914 --> 00:47:10,794
It was nearly one o'clock the next afternoon when he woke up.

472
00:47:11,874 --> 00:47:14,554
His servant brought him a cup of tea and some letters.

473
00:47:15,594 --> 00:47:19,634
One of them was from Lord Henry, and had been brought by hand that morning.

474
00:47:20,734 --> 00:47:21,914
He put it to one side.

475
00:47:23,994 --> 00:47:27,154
He went into the library for breakfast feeling perfectly happy.

476
00:47:28,454 --> 00:47:31,494
Then he saw the open window and the covered portrait.

477
00:47:33,034 --> 00:47:34,015
Was it all true?

478
00:47:35,074 --> 00:47:36,574
Or had it just been a dream?

479
00:47:38,074 --> 00:47:40,934
But he remembered that cruel mouth so clearly.

480
00:47:43,074 --> 00:47:46,254
Dorian Gray sent his servant away and locked all the doors.

481
00:47:46,994 --> 00:47:51,614
Then he pulled the cover off the painting, and saw himself face to face.

482
00:47:53,355 --> 00:47:54,134
It was true.

483
00:47:54,934 --> 00:47:56,454
The portrait had changed.

484
00:47:58,574 --> 00:48:01,074
For hours he did not know what to do or think.

485
00:48:02,034 --> 00:48:06,934
Finally, he went over to the table and wrote a passionate letter to the girl he had loved.

486
00:48:07,835 --> 00:48:11,374
He asked her to forgive him for the terrible things he had said to her.

487
00:48:13,835 --> 00:48:18,494
Suddenly he heard a knock on the door, and he heard Lord Henry's voice outside.

488
00:48:20,474 --> 00:48:24,754
"My dear boy, I must see you. Let me in at once."

489
00:48:26,794 --> 00:48:29,574
He made no answer, but remained quite still.

490
00:48:30,814 --> 00:48:32,574
The knocking continued and grew louder.

491
00:48:34,314 --> 00:48:36,814
Yes, it was better to let Lord Henry in.

492
00:48:37,835 --> 00:48:40,594
He would explain to him the new life he was going to lead.

493
00:48:42,335 --> 00:48:45,574
He jumped up, covered the picture and opened the door.

494
00:48:47,515 --> 00:48:51,514
"I am sorry about it all, Dorian," said Lord Henry, as he entered.

495
00:48:52,454 --> 00:48:54,434
"But you must not think too much about it."

496
00:48:56,254 --> 00:48:59,914
"Do you mean about Sibyl Vine?" asked the boy.

497
00:48:59,974 --> 00:49:04,874
"Yes, of course," answered Lord Henry, sitting down and slowly pulling off his yellow gloves.

498
00:49:06,054 --> 00:49:13,174
"It is terrible, but you are not to blame. Tell me, did you go behind and see her after it was over?"

499
00:49:14,493 --> 00:49:14,913
"Yes."

500
00:49:16,094 --> 00:49:19,993
"I felt sure that you had. Did you have an argument?"

501
00:49:21,573 --> 00:49:32,513
"I was cruel, Harry - terribly cruel. But it is all right now. I am not sorry for anything that has happened. It has taught me to know myself better."

502
00:49:33,713 --> 00:49:37,433
"Oh, Dorian, I am so glad that you see it that way."

503
00:49:38,754 --> 00:49:45,954
"I want to be good, Harry. I don't want my soul to be ugly. I am going to marry Sibyl Vine."

504
00:49:47,393 --> 00:49:52,073
"Marry Sibyl Vine!" cried Lord Henry, standing up, and staring at him in surprise.

505
00:49:52,954 --> 00:49:55,413
"But, my dear Dorian -"

506
00:49:55,454 --> 00:50:04,653
"Yes, Harry, I know what you are going to say. Something horrible about getting married. Don't say it! Sibyl will be my wife!"

507
00:50:05,993 --> 00:50:12,373
"Your wife! Dorian!... Didn't you get my letter? I wrote to you this morning."

508
00:50:13,993 --> 00:50:18,254
"Your letter? Oh, yes, I remember. I have not read it yet, Harry."

509
00:50:19,813 --> 00:50:21,254
"You know nothing yet then?"

510
00:50:22,993 --> 00:50:23,693
"What do you mean?"

511
00:50:26,154 --> 00:50:32,294
Lord Henry walked across the room and sat down next to Dorian Gray.

512
00:50:32,353 --> 00:50:34,934
Taking both his hands in his own, he held them.

513
00:50:36,654 --> 00:50:42,893
"Dorian," he said, "my letter was to tell you that Sibyl Vane is dead."

514
00:50:45,533 --> 00:50:49,753
A cry of pain came from the boy's lips and he jumped to his feet.

515
00:50:51,273 --> 00:50:57,493
"Dead! Sibyl dead! It is not true! It is a horrible lie!"

516
00:50:58,474 --> 00:51:01,233
"It is true, Dorian," said Lord Henry.

517
00:51:01,953 --> 00:51:25,352
"It is in all the morning newspapers. The police will be asking questions, and you must keep your name out of any scandal. Things like that make a man fashionable in Paris. But in London they are a disaster for any gentleman. I suppose they don't know your name at the theatre? If they don't, it is all right. Did anyone see you going round to her room?"

518
00:51:27,713 --> 00:51:29,692
Dorian did not answer for a few moments.

519
00:51:30,792 --> 00:51:46,992
Finally he said in a strange voice, "Harry, did you say that the police are asking questions? What did you mean by that? Did Sibyl -? Oh, Harry this is terrible!"

520
00:51:48,672 --> 00:51:57,872
"I am sure that it was not an accident, though it must be described that way officially. She swallowed something horrible they use at theatres."

521
00:51:59,372 --> 00:52:03,112
"Harry, Harry, it is terrible!" cried the boy.

522
00:52:04,332 --> 00:52:12,152
"Yes, it is very sad, of course, but it is nothing to do with you. Come with me to dinner, and after we will go to the theatre."

523
00:52:14,232 --> 00:52:20,512
"So I have murdered Sibyl Vane," said Dorian Gray, half to himself.

524
00:52:20,573 --> 00:52:49,632
"Yet the roses are not less lovely. The birds still sing happily in my garden. And tonight I will have dinner with you and go to the theatre. How extraordinary life is! My first passionate love letter was to a dead girl. Yet why is it that I cannot feel this tragedy as much as I want to? I don't think I am heartless. Do you?"

525
00:52:51,372 --> 00:52:59,692
"You have done too many foolish things in the last fortnight to be heartless, Dorian," answered Lord Henry, with his sweet, sad smile.

526
00:53:02,792 --> 00:53:05,192
The boy frowned.

527
00:53:05,253 --> 00:53:11,551
"I don't like that explanation, Harry," he said, "but I am glad you don't think I am heartless."

528
00:53:13,911 --> 00:53:18,291
"A woman has killed herself for the love of you," said Lord Henry.

529
00:53:19,211 --> 00:53:20,512
"That is very beautiful."

530
00:53:23,632 --> 00:53:24,432
They were silent.

531
00:53:26,051 --> 00:53:27,791
The evening darkened in the room.

532
00:53:29,651 --> 00:53:31,611
After some time Dorian Gray looked up.

533
00:53:33,871 --> 00:53:52,771
"How well you know me! But we will not talk again of what has happened. It has been something wonderful. That is all. Now, I have to dress, Harry. I feel too tired to eat anything, but I will join you later at the theatre."

534
00:53:56,251 --> 00:54:01,631
As Lord Henry closed the door behind him Dorian rushed to the portrait and tore off the cover.

535
00:54:03,172 --> 00:54:06,251
No, there was no further change in the picture.

536
00:54:07,831 --> 00:54:12,551
It had received the news of Sibyl Vane's death before he had known of it himself.

537
00:54:14,471 --> 00:54:16,611
Tears came to his eyes as he remembered her.

538
00:54:18,331 --> 00:54:20,591
He brushed them away and looked again at the picture.

539
00:54:22,551 --> 00:54:24,852
He felt the time had come to choose.

540
00:54:26,551 --> 00:54:29,711
Or had he already chosen?

541
00:54:29,771 --> 00:54:32,611
Yes, life had decided that for him.

542
00:54:33,532 --> 00:54:37,491
The portrait was going to carry his shame: that was all.

543
00:54:40,411 --> 00:54:44,852
An hour later he was at the theatre, and Lord Henry was sitting beside him.

544
00:54:53,672 --> 00:54:57,331
CHAPTER SEVEN

545
00:54:57,371 --> 00:54:57,791
"What Is Past Is Past?"

546
00:54:57,871 --> 00:55:03,811
As he was eating breakfast the next morning, Basil Hallward was shown into the room.

547
00:55:03,871 --> 00:55:10,470
I am so glad I have found you, Dorian," he said. "I called last night, and they told me that you were at the theatre.

548
00:55:11,250 --> 00:55:13,210
Of course I knew that was impossible.

549
00:55:14,250 --> 00:55:18,350
I had a terrible evening worrying whether one tragedy would be followed by another.

550
00:55:19,570 --> 00:55:22,650
I can't tell you how heart-broken I am about the whole thing.

551
00:55:23,891 --> 00:55:25,370
Did you go and see the girl's mother?

552
00:55:26,430 --> 00:55:27,850
What did she say about it all?"

553
00:55:30,090 --> 00:55:33,311
"My dear Basil, I don't know," said Dorian Gray.

554
00:55:34,430 --> 00:55:35,610
He looked very bored.

555
00:55:36,971 --> 00:55:38,110
"I was at the theatre."

556
00:55:40,550 --> 00:55:45,311
"You went to the theatre?" said Hallward, speaking very slowly.

557
00:55:46,991 --> 00:55:50,550
"You went to the theatre where Sibyl Vane was lying dead?"

558
00:55:51,991 --> 00:55:56,331
"Stop, Basil! I won't hear it!" cried Dorian, jumping to his feet.

559
00:55:57,331 --> 00:56:02,991
"You must not speak of such things. What is done is done. What is past is past."

560
00:56:04,850 --> 00:56:22,970
"You call yesterday the past? Dorian, this is horrible! Something has changed you completely. You look exactly the same as the wonderful boy in my picture, but now there is no heart in you. It is all Harry's influence. I see that."

561
00:56:25,070 --> 00:56:28,870
The boy went to the window and looked out at the garden for a few moments.

562
00:56:30,851 --> 00:56:34,290
"Harry has taught me many things, Basil." he said at last.

563
00:56:35,531 --> 00:56:37,950
"You have only taught me to love my own beauty."

564
00:56:39,811 --> 00:56:41,710
"I am truly sorry for that, Dorian."

565
00:56:43,870 --> 00:56:49,830
I don't know what you mean, Basil," he said, turning round. "I don't know what you want.

566
00:56:50,851 --> 00:56:51,851
What do you want?"

567
00:56:53,991 --> 00:56:58,631
"I want the Dorian Gray I used to paint," said the artist sadly.

568
00:57:00,370 --> 00:57:11,209
"Basil," said the boy, going over to him and putting his hand on his shoulder, "you have come too late. Yesterday when I heard that Sibyl Vane had killed herself-"

569
00:57:12,370 --> 00:57:17,230
"Killed herself! My God! Is there no doubt about that?" cried Hallward.

570
00:57:18,089 --> 00:57:20,709
"My dear Basil! Of course she killed herself."

571
00:57:22,669 --> 00:57:24,810
The older man put his face in his hands.

572
00:57:26,969 --> 00:57:29,789
"How terrible," he said in a quiet voice.

573
00:57:31,230 --> 00:57:56,129
"No," said Dorian Gray, "there is nothing terrible about it. It is one of the great romantic tragedies of our time. I know you are surprised at me talking to you like this. You have not realized how I have changed. I was a boy when you knew me. I am a man now. I have new passions, new thoughts, new ideas -"

574
00:57:56,169 --> 00:57:56,890
"But Dorian -"

575
00:57:56,930 --> 00:58:21,869
"I am different, but you must not like me less. Of course I am very fond of Harry. But I know that you are better than he is. You are not stronger - you are too afraid of life - but you are better. And how happy we used to be together! Don't leave me, Basil, and don't argue with me. I am what I am."

576
00:58:24,269 --> 00:58:26,289
The painter felt strangely sad.

577
00:58:27,470 --> 00:58:29,909
Dorian Gray was extraordinarily important to him.

578
00:58:30,890 --> 00:58:32,610
The boy had changed his art.

579
00:58:33,890 --> 00:58:38,349
Perhaps his cruel talk about Sibyl Vane was just a mood that would pass away.

580
00:58:39,589 --> 00:58:41,429
There was so much in him that was good.

581
00:58:44,070 --> 00:58:57,069
"Well, Dorian," he said with a sad smile, "I won't speak to you again about this horrible thing. I only hope that your name is kept out of any scandal. Have the police asked to see you?"

582
00:58:59,309 --> 00:59:00,409
Dorian shook his head.

583
00:59:01,229 --> 00:59:03,489
"They don't even know my name," he answered.

584
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:06,749
"She didn't know your name?"

585
00:59:08,008 --> 00:59:24,568
"Only my first name, and I am sure that she did not tell it to anyone. She told her family that I was Prince Charming. It was pretty of her. You must do me a drawing of Sibyl, Basil. I would like to have something more of her than the memory of a few kisses."

586
00:59:26,648 --> 00:59:33,908
"I will try and do something, Dorian. But you must come and sit for me again. I can't work so well without you."

587
00:59:35,648 --> 00:59:39,808
"I can never sit for you again, Basil. It is impossible!" he cried.

588
00:59:40,888 --> 00:59:44,668
"My dear boy, what is this foolishness!" Hallward cried.

589
00:59:45,708 --> 01:00:02,168
"Did you not like what I did for you? Where is it? Why have you covered it? Let me look at it. It is the best thing I have ever done. It is very bad of your servant to hide my work like that. I felt the room looked different as I came in."

590
01:00:04,148 --> 01:00:10,348
"It was not my servant who covered it, Basil. I did it myself. The light was too strong on the portrait."

591
01:00:11,289 --> 01:00:19,248
"Too strong! No, the light is perfect in here. Let me see it." And Hallward walked towards the corner of the room.

592
01:00:20,969 --> 01:00:26,808
A terrible cry came from Dorian Gray's lips, and he rushed between the painter and the covered portrait.

593
01:00:27,708 --> 01:00:30,808
"Basil, you must not look at it! I don't want you to."

594
01:00:32,068 --> 01:00:38,588
"Not look at my own work! Are you serious? Why shouldn't I look at it?" cried Hallward, laughing.

595
01:00:39,908 --> 01:00:46,149
"If you try and look at it, Basil, I promise I will never speak to you again. I am very serious."

596
01:00:48,568 --> 01:00:50,828
Hallward looked at Dorian Gray in surprise.

597
01:00:51,588 --> 01:00:53,188
He had never seen him like this before.

598
01:00:54,109 --> 01:00:57,188
The boy's face was white and angry.

599
01:00:57,249 --> 01:00:57,848
"Dorian!"

600
01:00:58,929 --> 01:01:01,109
"Don't speak!"

601
01:01:01,188 --> 01:01:07,988
"But what is the matter? Of course I won't look at it if you don't want me to," he said coldly, walking over to the window.

602
01:01:09,327 --> 01:01:15,628
"But it seems rather absurd that I cannot see my own work when I am going to exhibit it in Paris in the autumn."

603
01:01:17,107 --> 01:01:21,147
"To exhibit it? You want to exhibit it?" cried Dorian Gray.

604
01:01:22,167 --> 01:01:24,187
A terrible fear was building inside him.

605
01:01:25,367 --> 01:01:27,367
Was the world going to see his secret?

606
01:01:28,187 --> 01:01:30,808
Were people going to stare at the mystery of his life?

607
01:01:31,787 --> 01:01:32,888
That was impossible.

608
01:01:34,327 --> 01:01:41,567
"Yes, George Petit is going to exhibit all my best pictures in October. Don't worry, it is only for one month."

609
01:01:43,488 --> 01:01:45,987
Dorian Gray passed his hand across his face.

610
01:01:46,927 --> 01:01:48,227
It felt hot and wet.

611
01:01:49,267 --> 01:01:51,667
He felt that he was about to face horrible danger.

612
01:01:53,707 --> 01:01:57,387
"You told me a month ago that you would never exhibit it," he cried.

613
01:01:58,047 --> 01:02:05,267
"Why have you changed your mind?" He stopped suddenly and a cruel look came into his eyes.

614
01:02:06,407 --> 01:02:22,407
He had remembered something Lord Henry had said to him, "Ask Basil why he won't exhibit your picture. He told me once and it is a very strange story." Yes, perhaps Basil too had his secret.

615
01:02:23,427 --> 01:02:25,287
He would ask him and try.

616
01:02:27,308 --> 01:02:31,907
"Basil," he said, coming over quite close, and looking him straight in the face.

617
01:02:32,967 --> 01:02:38,527
"We all have secrets. What was your reason for not wanting to exhibit my picture?"

618
01:02:40,707 --> 01:02:57,107
"Dorian, if I told you, you might like me less than you do now. And you would certainly laugh at me. If you don't want me ever to look at your picture again, I won't. I have always you to look at. Your friendship is more important to me than exhibiting a painting."

619
01:02:58,607 --> 01:03:03,867
"No, Basil, you must tell me," said Dorian Gray.

620
01:03:03,927 --> 01:03:05,827
His feeling of fear had passed away.

621
01:03:06,786 --> 01:03:09,846
Now he just wanted to find out Basil Hallward's mystery.

622
01:03:11,767 --> 01:03:14,466
"Dorian," said the painter, who did not look happy.

623
01:03:15,946 --> 01:03:19,946
"Have you ever noticed something in the picture, something strange?"

624
01:03:21,986 --> 01:03:25,146
"Basil!" cried the boy, staring at him with wild eyes.

625
01:03:26,806 --> 01:03:48,626
"I see you did. Dorian, from the moment I met you, your personality had the most extraordinary influence over me. I worshipped you. I was jealous of everyone you spoke to. I wanted to have you all to myself. I was only happy when I was with you. When you were away from me you were still there in my art."

626
01:03:49,867 --> 01:03:50,946
"Basil -"

627
01:03:50,966 --> 01:04:33,766
"No, don't speak. I must tell you now what I did not tell you then. That I decided to paint a wonderful portrait of you. I put all my feelings for you into that picture. I felt, Dorian, that I had told too much. I had put too much of myself into it. So I decided never to exhibit the portrait. I told Harry and he laughed. When the picture was finished, and I sat alone with it, I felt that I was right... Later, I thought that perhaps I was being foolish and when this Paris offer came... but I see now that the picture cannot be shown."

628
01:04:36,966 --> 01:04:38,966
Dorian Gray breathed deeply.

629
01:04:39,786 --> 01:04:43,846
The colour came back to his cheeks and a smile crossed his lips.

630
01:04:45,406 --> 01:04:48,486
The danger was over and he was safe for a while.

631
01:04:50,547 --> 01:04:52,766
What a sad story Basil had told.

632
01:04:54,066 --> 01:04:57,386
Would he ever be so influenced by the personality of a friend?

633
01:04:58,687 --> 01:05:01,806
Lord Henry had the charm of being very dangerous.

634
01:05:02,706 --> 01:05:03,606
But that was all.

635
01:05:05,865 --> 01:05:11,365
"It is extraordinary to me, Dorian," said Hallward, "that you saw this in the portrait."

636
01:05:14,385 --> 01:05:21,126
T saw something in it," he answered, "something that seemed to me very strange."

637
01:05:22,505 --> 01:05:25,786
"Well, you don't mind me looking at the thing now?"

638
01:05:27,225 --> 01:05:28,345
Dorian shook his head.

639
01:05:29,825 --> 01:05:34,545
"You must not ask me that, Basil. I cannot let you stand in front of that picture."

640
01:05:36,245 --> 01:05:37,565
"You will one day, won't you?"

641
01:05:38,685 --> 01:05:39,106
"Never."

642
01:05:39,905 --> 01:05:55,545
"Well, perhaps you are right. And now goodbye, Dorian. You have been the one person in my life who has really influenced my art. But you don't know what it cost me to tell you all that I have told you."

643
01:05:57,565 --> 01:06:06,765
"My dear Basil," said Dorian, "what have you told me? Only that you worshipped me too much. That is not even flattery."

644
01:06:08,646 --> 01:06:19,305
"It was not meant as flattery. And now that I have told you, something seems to have gone out of me. Perhaps you should never put what you worship into words."

645
01:06:21,186 --> 01:06:28,665
"You mustn't talk about worship. It is foolish. You and I are friends, Basil, and we will always be friends."

646
01:06:30,205 --> 01:06:33,045
"You have got Harry." said the painter, sadly.

647
01:06:33,945 --> 01:06:36,725
"Oh, Harry!" laughed the young man.

648
01:06:37,185 --> 01:06:50,245
"Harry spends his life saying and doing extraordinary things. He lives the sort of life I want to live. But I don't think I would go to Harry if I was in trouble. I would prefer to go to you, Basil."

649
01:06:52,245 --> 01:06:53,645
"You will sit for me again?"

650
01:06:54,745 --> 01:07:03,145
"Impossible! There is something terrible about a portrait. It has a life of its own. I will come and have tea with you instead."

651
01:07:04,784 --> 01:07:13,485
"Well, goodbye then. I am sorry that you won't let me look at the picture again. But I understand what you feel about it."

652
01:07:16,124 --> 01:07:19,464
As he left the room, Dorian Gray smiled to himself.

653
01:07:20,624 --> 01:07:21,584
Poor Basil!

654
01:07:22,745 --> 01:07:24,825
How little he knew of the true reason.

655
01:07:26,224 --> 01:07:31,484
And now he understood more the painter's wild and jealous feelings, and he felt sorry.

656
01:07:32,304 --> 01:07:35,764
There was something tragic in a friendship so corrupted by passion.

657
01:07:38,025 --> 01:07:39,884
He rang the bell to call his servant.

658
01:07:40,544 --> 01:07:42,364
He had to hide the portrait immediately.

659
01:07:43,424 --> 01:07:48,165
It had been mad of him to leave it in a place where it could be discovered by his friends.

660
01:07:52,005 --> 01:07:52,744
CHAPTER EIGHT

661
01:07:54,783 --> 01:07:54,843
The Portrait Is Hidden

662
01:07:54,843 --> 01:07:59,363
When the servant entered, Dorian Gray asked him to send Mrs Leaf to him in the library.

663
01:08:00,463 --> 01:08:02,964
Mrs Leaf had been with his family for many years.

664
01:08:03,704 --> 01:08:06,143
He asked her for the key to the old schoolroom.

665
01:08:07,523 --> 01:08:10,244
"The old schoolroom, Mr Dorian?" she cried.

666
01:08:10,764 --> 01:08:13,743
"But it is full of dust! I must clean it first."

667
01:08:15,043 --> 01:08:18,483
"I don't want it cleaned, Mrs Leaf. I only want the key."

668
01:08:19,703 --> 01:08:27,843
"Well, sir, you'll be covered with dust if you go into it. It hasn't been open for nearly five years, not since your grandfather died."

669
01:08:29,143 --> 01:08:31,403
He frowned at this reminder of his grandfather.

670
01:08:32,084 --> 01:08:34,123
He had bad memories of all his family.

671
01:08:35,424 --> 01:08:37,303
"That does not matter," he answered.

672
01:08:37,663 --> 01:08:41,243
"I just want to see the place - that is all. Give me the key."

673
01:08:42,303 --> 01:08:44,924
"Here is the key, sir," said the old lady.

674
01:08:45,723 --> 01:08:48,043
"But you are not going to live up there, are you, sir?"

675
01:08:49,023 --> 01:08:50,563
"No, no," he cried.

676
01:08:51,343 --> 01:08:53,623
"Thank you, Mrs Leaf. You can go."

677
01:08:55,403 --> 01:08:58,303
An hour later two men arrived to move the portrait.

678
01:08:59,924 --> 01:09:04,083
"It's very heavy, sir," said one of the men, as they climbed the stairs.

679
01:09:05,523 --> 01:09:13,723
"I am afraid it is rather heavy," said Dorian, as he opened the door of the old schoolroom where he was going to hide the secret of his corrupted soul.

680
01:09:15,263 --> 01:09:17,543
He had not entered the room since he was a child.

681
01:09:18,263 --> 01:09:22,163
It was a large room built by his grandfather to keep him at a distance.

682
01:09:23,163 --> 01:09:27,183
Every moment of his lonely childhood came back to him as he looked round.

683
01:09:28,683 --> 01:09:33,483
It was a room full of terrible memories, but it was safe.

684
01:09:33,543 --> 01:09:36,383
He had the key, and no other person could enter it.

685
01:09:37,003 --> 01:09:39,523
The face in the portrait could grow old and ugly.

686
01:09:40,063 --> 01:09:40,883
What did it matter?

687
01:09:41,563 --> 01:09:42,503
No one could see it.

688
01:09:43,203 --> 01:09:44,543
He himself would not see it.

689
01:09:45,663 --> 01:09:48,603
He did not have to watch the terrible corruption of his soul.

690
01:09:49,523 --> 01:09:52,343
He would stay young - that was enough.

691
01:09:54,623 --> 01:09:58,882
When the men had gone, Dorian locked the door, and put the key in his pocket.

692
01:09:59,583 --> 01:10:00,762
He felt safe now.

693
01:10:01,683 --> 01:10:03,963
No one would ever look at that horrible thing.

694
01:10:04,842 --> 01:10:06,942
Only he would ever see his shame.

695
01:10:08,982 --> 01:10:12,282
He went back to the library and found a note from Lord Henry.

696
01:10:13,422 --> 01:10:16,362
In it was a report from the newspaper about Sibyl Vane.

697
01:10:17,442 --> 01:10:20,642
Her death was officially described as an accident.

698
01:10:22,022 --> 01:10:24,422
He frowned, and tore the paper in two.

699
01:10:25,482 --> 01:10:28,122
Then he walked across the room and threw the pieces away.

700
01:10:29,182 --> 01:10:30,762
How ugly it all was!

701
01:10:31,482 --> 01:10:34,262
And how horribly real ugliness made things!

702
01:10:35,962 --> 01:10:40,063
Perhaps the servant had read the report, and had begun to suspect something.

703
01:10:41,703 --> 01:10:43,462
And, yet, what did it matter?

704
01:10:44,322 --> 01:10:47,383
What had Dorian Gray to do with Sibyl Vane's death?

705
01:10:48,223 --> 01:10:49,522
There was nothing to be afraid of.

706
01:10:50,563 --> 01:10:52,902
Dorian Gray had not killed her.

707
01:10:56,782 --> 01:10:57,602
CHAPTER NINE

708
01:10:59,642 --> 01:11:00,122
"I Will Show You my Soul"

709
01:11:00,182 --> 01:11:02,162
Many years passed.

710
01:11:02,222 --> 01:11:08,743
Yet the wonderful beauty that had so fascinated Basil Hallward, stayed with Dorian Gray.

711
01:11:08,862 --> 01:11:13,342
Even those who had heard terrible rumours against him, could not believe them when they met him.

712
01:11:14,243 --> 01:11:17,462
He always had the look of someone who had kept himself pure.

713
01:11:19,542 --> 01:11:26,302
Many people suspected that there was something very wrong with Dorian's life, but only he knew about the portrait.

714
01:11:27,362 --> 01:11:29,982
Some nights he would secretly enter the locked room.

715
01:11:30,962 --> 01:11:36,563
Holding a mirror in his hand, he would stand in front of the picture Basil Hallward had painted.

716
01:11:36,642 --> 01:11:44,722
He would look first at the horrible, old face in the picture, and then at the handsome young face that laughed back at him from the mirror.

717
01:11:46,342 --> 01:11:49,882
He fell more and more in love with his own beauty.

718
01:11:50,222 --> 01:11:53,282
And more and more interested in the corruption of his own soul.

719
01:11:54,941 --> 01:11:57,681
Then something happened that changed everything.

720
01:11:59,341 --> 01:12:02,961
It was on the ninth of November, the day before his thirty-eighth birthday.

721
01:12:04,082 --> 01:12:07,981
He was walking home from Lord Henry's and the night was cold and foggy.

722
01:12:08,721 --> 01:12:13,542
At the corner of Grosvenor Square and South Audley Street, a man passed him in the fog.

723
01:12:14,401 --> 01:12:17,921
He was walking very fast, and had the collar of his coat turned up.

724
01:12:18,741 --> 01:12:20,061
He had a bag in his hand.

725
01:12:21,261 --> 01:12:22,381
Dorian recognized him.

726
01:12:23,081 --> 01:12:24,301
It was Basil Hallward.

727
01:12:25,561 --> 01:12:29,861
A strange fear made Dorian walk off quickly in the direction of his own house.

728
01:12:31,482 --> 01:12:32,661
But Hallward had seen him.

729
01:12:33,401 --> 01:12:35,161
Dorian heard him hurrying after him.

730
01:12:35,982 --> 01:12:38,181
In a few moments his hand was on his arm.

731
01:12:39,642 --> 01:12:59,161
"Dorian! What an extraordinary piece of luck! I have been waiting for you in your library ever since nine o'clock. I am going to Paris on the midnight train, and I wanted to see you before I left. I thought it was you, or at least your coat, as I passed you. But I wasn't sure. Didn't you recognize me?"

732
01:13:00,441 --> 01:13:16,981
"In this fog, my dear Basil? I can't even recognize Grosvenor Square. I believe my house is somewhere about here, but I don't feel at all certain about it. I am sorry you are going away, as I have not seen you for such a long time. But I suppose you will be back soon?"

733
01:13:18,282 --> 01:13:28,041
"No, I am going to be out of England for six months. Here we are at your door. Let me come in for a moment. I have something to say to you."

734
01:13:29,322 --> 01:13:38,322
"That would be lovely. But won't you miss your train?" said Dorian Gray, as he went up the steps and opened the door with his key.

735
01:13:38,381 --> 01:13:40,281
"I have plenty of time," he answered.

736
01:13:40,881 --> 01:13:49,921
"The train doesn't go until twelve-fifteen, and it is only just eleven. All I have with me is this bag, and I can easily get to Victoria Station in twenty minutes."

737
01:13:51,561 --> 01:13:53,161
Dorian looked at him and smiled.

738
01:13:54,540 --> 01:13:57,020
"Come in or the fog will get into my house."

739
01:13:58,720 --> 01:14:00,800
Hallward followed Dorian into the library.

740
01:14:01,461 --> 01:14:05,501
There was a bright wood fire on one side of the room and two lamps on the other.

741
01:14:07,900 --> 01:14:10,020
"Would you like a drink?"asked Dorian.

742
01:14:11,300 --> 01:14:15,341
"No thanks, I won't have anything more," said the painter, taking his hat and coat off.

743
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:24,700
"And now, my dear Dorian, I want to speak to you seriously. Don't frown like that. You make it so much more difficult for me.""

744
01:14:26,580 --> 01:14:33,060
"What is it all about?" cried Dorian, throwing himself down on the sofa. "I hope it is not about myself.

745
01:14:33,161 --> 01:14:34,940
I am tired of myself tonight.

746
01:14:35,501 --> 01:14:37,400
I would prefer to be somebody different."

747
01:14:39,540 --> 01:14:44,720
"It is about yourself," answered Hallward, in his deep voice, "and I must say it to you."

748
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:48,600
Dorian breathed deeply and lit a cigarette.

749
01:14:50,140 --> 01:14:52,180
"Is it really necessary, Basil?"

750
01:14:53,460 --> 01:14:57,060
"I think you should know some of the terrible things that people are saying about you."

751
01:14:58,500 --> 01:15:05,741
"I don't want to know anything about them. I love scandals about other people, but scandals about myself don't interest me."

752
01:15:07,201 --> 01:15:24,661
"Every gentleman is interested in his good name, Dorian. You don't want people to talk of you as something terrible and corrupt. But I don't believe these rumours at all. At least I can't believe them when I see you. Corruption is a thing that writes itself across a man's face. It cannot be hidden."

753
01:15:24,720 --> 01:15:27,140
"My dear Basil -"

754
01:15:27,940 --> 01:15:48,160
"And yet, I rarely see you now and you never come to my house. When I hear all the terrible things people are whispering about you, I don't know what to say. Why have so many of your friends killed themselves? Young men from good families like Adrian Singleton and that poor young soldier?"

755
01:15:49,320 --> 01:15:54,279
"Stop, Basil. You are talking about things of which you know nothing," said Dorian.

756
01:15:54,879 --> 01:16:04,779
"I know how people talk in England. This is a country where people have two faces. They whisper rumours about people like myself, and then do much worse things when others are not looking."

757
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:24,079
"Dorian," cried Hallward, "that is not the question. I know England is bad, but that's the reason I want you to be a good influence on your friends. Instead you have lost all belief in goodness and honesty. You have filled those poor young men with a madness for pleasure."

758
01:16:25,439 --> 01:16:26,439
Dorian smiled.

759
01:16:27,779 --> 01:16:44,019
"How can you smile like that? I only want you to have a clean name. You have a wonderful influence. Let it be for good. Yet I wonder whether I know you? But I can't answer that question. I would need to see your soul."

760
01:16:45,719 --> 01:16:48,419
"To see my soul!" cried Dorian Gray.

761
01:16:48,939 --> 01:16:52,039
He jumped up from the sofa, turning almost white with fear.

762
01:16:53,699 --> 01:16:55,459
"Yes," answered Hallward.

763
01:16:56,359 --> 01:16:58,080
There was a deep sadness in his voice.

764
01:16:58,779 --> 01:17:02,659
"To see your soul. But only God can do that."

765
01:17:04,500 --> 01:17:07,139
A bitter laugh came from the lips of the younger man.

766
01:17:08,619 --> 01:17:13,019
"You will see it yourself, tonight!" he cried, picking up a lamp from the table.

767
01:17:13,679 --> 01:17:32,979
"Come, it is your own work. Why shouldn't you look at it? You can tell the world all about it after, if you want. Nobody will believe you. If they do believe you, they will like me better for it. Come, I tell you. You have talked enough about corruption. Now you will see it face to face."

768
01:17:34,439 --> 01:17:37,040
There was madness in every word he said.

769
01:17:37,099 --> 01:17:41,019
He felt a terrible delight that someone was going to share his secret.

770
01:17:41,079 --> 01:17:45,299
The man who had painted the portrait was going to share his shame.

771
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:49,319
The painter would suffer for the rest of his life with the memory of what he had done.

772
01:17:52,079 --> 01:17:53,858
"Yes," he continued, coming closer to him.

773
01:17:54,478 --> 01:17:59,378
"I will show you my soul. You will see what you think only God can see."

774
01:18:00,878 --> 01:18:01,858
Hallward jumped back.

775
01:18:03,158 --> 01:18:05,518
"You cannot say things like that, Dorian!" he cried.

776
01:18:05,879 --> 01:18:08,018
"They are horrible and they don't mean anything."

777
01:18:09,238 --> 01:18:11,498
"You think so?" He laughed again.

778
01:18:11,879 --> 01:18:15,059
"I know so. Dorian, you have to tell me -"

779
01:18:15,098 --> 01:18:18,398
"Don't touch me. Finish what you have to say."

780
01:18:20,459 --> 01:18:22,578
The painter felt extraordinarily sad.

781
01:18:23,358 --> 01:18:25,258
He walked over to the fire and stood there.

782
01:18:26,479 --> 01:18:31,218
"I am waiting, Basil," said the young man, in a hard, clear voice.

783
01:18:33,358 --> 01:18:34,098
He turned round.

784
01:18:35,738 --> 01:18:38,338
"What I have to say is this," he cried.

785
01:18:38,918 --> 01:18:54,518
"You must give me some answer to the horrible things people are saying against you. Tell me that they are not true, Dorian! Can't you see what I am going through? My God! Don't tell me that you are bad and corrupt and shameful."

786
01:18:56,178 --> 01:18:57,558
Dorian Gray smiled.

787
01:18:59,258 --> 01:19:02,118
"Come upstairs, Basil," he said, quietly.

788
01:19:02,959 --> 01:19:08,319
"I keep a diary of my life from day to day. I will show it to you if you come up with me."

789
01:19:10,478 --> 01:19:23,458
"I will come with you, Dorian, if you wish it. I see I have missed my train. It does not matter. I can go tomorrow. But don't ask me to read anything tonight. All I want is a simple answer to my question."

790
01:19:25,758 --> 01:19:32,359
"I will give it to you upstairs. I could not give it to you here. You will not have to read for long."

791
01:19:37,018 --> 01:19:37,758
CHAPTER TEN

792
01:19:39,698 --> 01:19:40,158
Basil Sees the Portrait

793
01:19:40,198 --> 01:19:43,178
He passed out of the room and began climbing the stairs.

794
01:19:44,398 --> 01:19:46,378
Basil Hallward followed close behind.

795
01:19:47,459 --> 01:19:50,738
They walked softly, as people always do at night.

796
01:19:50,798 --> 01:19:53,757
The lamp made strange shadows on the wall and stairs.

797
01:19:55,077 --> 01:19:58,077
When they reached the top, Dorian put the lamp down on the floor.

798
01:19:58,697 --> 01:20:01,117
He took the key out of his pocket and turned it in the lock.

799
01:20:02,878 --> 01:20:06,797
"You really want to know, Basil?" he asked in a low voice.

800
01:20:08,277 --> 01:20:08,617
"Yes."

801
01:20:09,877 --> 01:20:12,598
"I am delighted," he answered, smiling.

802
01:20:13,178 --> 01:20:25,657
Then he added, "You are the one man in the world I want to know everything about me. You have influenced my life more than you think." Taking up the lamp, he opened the door and went in.

803
01:20:26,717 --> 01:20:28,337
Cold air passed between them.

804
01:20:29,837 --> 01:20:34,118
"Shut the door behind you," he whispered, as he placed the lamp on the table.

805
01:20:35,997 --> 01:20:37,938
Hallward looked around the room in surprise.

806
01:20:39,057 --> 01:20:41,317
The room had clearly not been lived in for years.

807
01:20:41,877 --> 01:20:45,357
The whole place was covered with dust, and there were holes in the carpet.

808
01:20:46,017 --> 01:20:47,497
A mouse ran across the floor.

809
01:20:50,037 --> 01:20:59,257
"So you think that it is only God who sees the soul, Basil. Take the cover off the portrait, and you will see mine."

810
01:21:01,138 --> 01:21:03,517
The voice that spoke was cold and cruel.

811
01:21:05,057 --> 01:21:07,958
"You are mad, Dorian," said Hallward, frowning.

812
01:21:08,977 --> 01:21:15,377
"You won't take the cover off? Then I will do it myself," said the young man, throwing the old purple curtain to the ground.

813
01:21:17,897 --> 01:21:21,797
A cry of fear came from the painter's lips when he saw the face in the portrait.

814
01:21:22,557 --> 01:21:27,137
It was Dorian Gray's face he was looking at, and it still had some of that wonderful beauty.

815
01:21:27,177 --> 01:21:30,418
But now there were terrible signs of age and corruption.

816
01:21:31,337 --> 01:21:32,117
But who had done it?

817
01:21:33,177 --> 01:21:34,557
He held the lamp up to the picture.

818
01:21:35,477 --> 01:21:38,377
In the left hand corner was his name, painted in red.

819
01:21:39,857 --> 01:21:40,677
What had happened?

820
01:21:41,317 --> 01:21:42,217
He had never done that.

821
01:21:43,297 --> 01:21:44,837
Still, it was his own picture.

822
01:21:44,897 --> 01:21:48,037
He knew it, and it made his blood turn to ice.

823
01:21:48,958 --> 01:21:50,877
His own picture!

824
01:21:50,937 --> 01:21:51,757
What did it mean?

825
01:21:52,377 --> 01:21:53,356
Why had it changed?

826
01:21:54,676 --> 01:21:58,796
He turned, and looked at Dorian Gray with the eyes of a sick man.

827
01:22:01,036 --> 01:22:03,536
The young man was standing near the wall, watching him.

828
01:22:04,536 --> 01:22:06,976
He had taken the flower out of his coat, and was smelling it.

829
01:22:08,597 --> 01:22:10,977
"What does this mean?" cried Hallward, at last.

830
01:22:12,057 --> 01:22:14,137
His own voice sounded high and strange.

831
01:22:16,377 --> 01:22:39,717
"Years ago, when I was a boy," said Dorian Gray, closing his hand on the flower, "you met me and flattered me. You taught me to love my beauty. One day you introduced me to a friend of yours. He explained to me how wonderful it was to be young. You finished a portrait of me that showed me how wonderful it was to be beautiful. In a mad moment I made a wish -"

832
01:22:40,936 --> 01:22:51,397
"I remember it! Oh, how well I remember it! No! The thing is impossible. There must be something wrong with the paint. I tell you the thing is impossible."

833
01:22:53,057 --> 01:22:58,136
"Is anything really impossible?" said the young man, going over to the window.

834
01:22:59,777 --> 01:23:01,656
"You told me you had destroyed it."

835
01:23:02,616 --> 01:23:06,076
"I was wrong. It has destroyed me."

836
01:23:07,597 --> 01:23:16,356
"I don't believe it is my picture. There was nothing bad in it, nothing shameful. You were perfect to me. This is a face from hell."

837
01:23:17,936 --> 01:23:24,436
"It is the face of my soul. Each of us has Heaven and Hell in him, Basil," cried Dorian wildly.

838
01:23:25,976 --> 01:23:28,296
Hallward turned again to the portrait, and stared at it.

839
01:23:29,156 --> 01:23:32,076
"My God! Is this true?" he cried.

840
01:23:32,636 --> 01:23:39,576
"Is this what you have done with your life? You must be even worse than people say!"

841
01:23:39,656 --> 01:23:44,696
Hallward threw himself into the chair by the table and put his face in his hands.

842
01:23:44,756 --> 01:23:46,956
The lamp fell to the floor and went out.

843
01:23:48,516 --> 01:23:59,515
"Good God, Dorian! What an awful lesson! What an awful lesson!" There was no answer, but he could hear the young man crying at the window.

844
01:24:01,156 --> 01:24:12,455
"We must ask God for forgiveness. I worshipped you too much. I am punished for it. You worshipped yourself too much. We are both punished."

845
01:24:14,595 --> 01:24:17,295
Dorian Gray turned slowly around and looked at him.

846
01:24:18,396 --> 01:24:19,855
There were tears in his eyes.

847
01:24:21,675 --> 01:24:24,315
"It is too late, Basil," he said.

848
01:24:26,096 --> 01:24:29,375
"But don't you see that hellish thing staring at us?"

849
01:24:31,416 --> 01:24:32,815
Dorian Gray looked at the picture.

850
01:24:33,875 --> 01:24:36,995
Suddenly he felt that he hated Basil Hallward.

851
01:24:37,995 --> 01:24:42,115
He hated the man sitting at the table more than he hated anything in his life.

852
01:24:43,435 --> 01:24:44,695
He looked wildly around.

853
01:24:45,375 --> 01:24:47,955
Something shone on top of the painted cupboard that faced him.

854
01:24:48,815 --> 01:24:50,895
It was a knife he had left there some days before.

855
01:24:52,295 --> 01:24:55,455
He moved slowly towards it, passing Hallward as he did so.

856
01:24:56,595 --> 01:24:58,535
He took the knife in his hand and turned around.

857
01:24:59,355 --> 01:25:00,756
Hallward moved in his chair.

858
01:25:01,775 --> 01:25:05,355
He rushed at him, and stuck the knife into his neck again and again.

859
01:25:07,735 --> 01:25:10,076
He threw the knife down on the table and stood back.

860
01:25:12,275 --> 01:25:16,595
He could hear nothing but the sound of blood falling on to the carpet.

861
01:25:18,675 --> 01:25:21,735
He opened the door and went out on to the stairs.

862
01:25:23,235 --> 01:25:24,855
The house was completely quiet.

863
01:25:25,975 --> 01:25:26,815
No one was there.

864
01:25:29,695 --> 01:25:32,775
How quickly it had all been done!

865
01:25:32,875 --> 01:25:35,815
Feeling strangely calm, he walked over to the window and opened it.

866
01:25:36,756 --> 01:25:39,275
The wind had blown the fog away and the sky was clear.

867
01:25:40,396 --> 01:25:43,495
He looked down and saw a policeman walking down the street.

868
01:25:43,576 --> 01:25:46,775
He was shining a lamp in all the houses.

869
01:25:46,835 --> 01:25:48,975
Closing the window, he went back into the room.

870
01:25:49,735 --> 01:25:51,216
He did not look at the murdered man.

871
01:25:52,155 --> 01:25:55,554
He felt that the secret of the whole thing was not to think about it at all.

872
01:25:56,734 --> 01:25:59,874
The friend who had painted the terrible portrait had gone out of his life.

873
01:26:00,414 --> 01:26:01,274
That was enough.

874
01:26:03,214 --> 01:26:06,674
He picked up the lamp and walked out of the room, locking the door behind him.

875
01:26:07,974 --> 01:26:12,014
As he walked down the stairs he thought that he heard what sounded like cries of pain.

876
01:26:13,554 --> 01:26:15,134
He stopped several times, and waited.

877
01:26:16,655 --> 01:26:19,094
No, everything was still.

878
01:26:21,854 --> 01:26:24,854
When he reached the library, he saw the bag and coat in the corner.

879
01:26:26,134 --> 01:26:27,535
They must be hidden away somewhere.

880
01:26:28,374 --> 01:26:30,355
He unlocked a secret cupboard and threw them in.

881
01:26:31,054 --> 01:26:32,434
He could easily burn them later.

882
01:26:33,335 --> 01:26:34,454
Then he pulled out his watch.

883
01:26:35,495 --> 01:26:37,155
It was twenty minutes to two.

884
01:26:38,894 --> 01:26:40,254
He sat down and began to think.

885
01:26:41,214 --> 01:26:43,614
Basil Hallward had left the house at eleven.

886
01:26:44,374 --> 01:26:45,754
No one had seen him come in again.

887
01:26:46,634 --> 01:26:50,694
The servants were in bed… Paris!

888
01:26:50,754 --> 01:26:51,154
Yes.

889
01:26:51,655 --> 01:26:53,434
It was to Paris that Basil had gone.

890
01:26:54,094 --> 01:26:56,394
And by the midnight train as he had planned.

891
01:26:56,994 --> 01:26:59,335
It would be months before anyone suspected anything.

892
01:26:59,634 --> 01:27:00,174
Months!

893
01:27:00,974 --> 01:27:03,174
He could destroy everything long before then.

894
01:27:04,835 --> 01:27:06,274
Suddenly he had a thought.

895
01:27:07,594 --> 01:27:10,515
He put on his coat and hat and went into the front room.

896
01:27:11,555 --> 01:27:14,214
From the window he could see the policeman passing the house.

897
01:27:15,294 --> 01:27:17,335
He waited, and held his breath.

898
01:27:19,134 --> 01:27:23,195
After a few moments he went out of the house, shutting the door very gently behind him.

899
01:27:24,155 --> 01:27:25,614
Then he began ringing the bell.

900
01:27:26,875 --> 01:27:29,474
In about five minutes a servant appeared.

901
01:27:29,534 --> 01:27:33,555
He was half dressed and looked very sleepy.

902
01:27:33,614 --> 01:27:37,294
"I am sorry I had to wake you up, Francis," he said, stepping in.

903
01:27:37,794 --> 01:27:42,894
"But I have forgotten my key. What time is it?"

904
01:27:42,974 --> 01:27:47,515
"Ten minutes past two, sir," answered the man, looking at a clock.

905
01:27:47,574 --> 01:27:53,853
"Ten minutes past two? How horribly late! You must wake me at nine tomorrow. I have some work to do."

906
01:27:55,173 --> 01:27:55,813
"All right, sir."

907
01:27:55,893 --> 01:27:58,753
"Did anyone call this evening?"

908
01:27:59,673 --> 01:28:04,733
"Mr Hallward, sir. He stayed here until eleven, and then he went away to catch his train."

909
01:28:05,833 --> 01:28:09,573
"Oh! I am sorry I didn't see him. Did he leave any message?"

910
01:28:10,713 --> 01:28:13,514
"No, sir. He said he would write to you from Paris."

911
01:28:14,774 --> 01:28:18,173
"That is all, Francis. Don't forget to call me at nine tomorrow."

912
01:28:19,553 --> 01:28:20,013
"No, sir."

913
01:28:21,253 --> 01:28:22,853
The man went off to his bedroom.

914
01:28:24,993 --> 01:28:29,233
Dorian Gray threw his hat and coat upon the table and passed into the library.

915
01:28:30,594 --> 01:28:34,033
For a quarter of an hour he walked up and down the room, biting his lip and thinking.

916
01:28:35,193 --> 01:28:38,613
Then he took down a book from one of the cupboards, and began to turn the pages.

917
01:28:40,153 --> 01:28:49,493
"Alan Campbell, 152 Hertford Street, Mayfair." Yes, that was the man he wanted.

918
01:28:54,233 --> 01:28:55,114
CHAPTER ELEVEN

919
01:28:57,053 --> 01:28:57,513
The Problem of the Body

920
01:28:57,553 --> 01:29:02,333
At nine o'clock the next morning his servant came in with a cup of chocolate, and opened the curtains.

921
01:29:03,494 --> 01:29:07,853
Dorian was sleeping quite peacefully, lying with one hand under his cheek.

922
01:29:09,833 --> 01:29:12,413
As he opened his eyes a smile passed across his lips.

923
01:29:13,873 --> 01:29:16,314
He turned round, and began to drink his chocolate.

924
01:29:17,033 --> 01:29:19,813
The November sun came into the room, and the sky was bright.

925
01:29:20,293 --> 01:29:21,913
It was almost like a morning in May.

926
01:29:23,693 --> 01:29:26,013
Slowly he remembered what had happened the night before.

927
01:29:27,494 --> 01:29:30,613
The dead man was still sitting there, and in the sunlight now.

928
01:29:31,653 --> 01:29:33,233
How horrible that was!

929
01:29:34,073 --> 01:29:36,653
Such terrible things were for the darkness, not the day.

930
01:29:39,094 --> 01:29:43,373
After he had drunk his cup of chocolate, he went over to the table and wrote two letters.

931
01:29:44,173 --> 01:29:49,713
One he put in his pocket, and the other he handed to his servant.

932
01:29:49,774 --> 01:29:56,013
"Take this round to 152 Hertford Street, Francis. If Mr Campbell is out of town, get his address."

933
01:29:58,192 --> 01:30:02,432
When the servant had gone, he lit a cigarette, and began drawing on a piece of paper.

934
01:30:03,333 --> 01:30:06,392
First he drew flowers, then houses, then human faces.

935
01:30:07,772 --> 01:30:10,732
Suddenly he realized that every face he drew looked like Basil Hallward.

936
01:30:11,812 --> 01:30:14,172
He frowned and went over to lie on the sofa.

937
01:30:15,852 --> 01:30:17,652
An hour went past very slowly.

938
01:30:18,432 --> 01:30:20,412
Every second he kept looking up at the clock.

939
01:30:21,512 --> 01:30:23,792
As the minutes went by he became horribly worried.

940
01:30:24,792 --> 01:30:26,272
He got up and walked around the room.

941
01:30:27,053 --> 01:30:28,732
His hands were strangely cold.

942
01:30:30,112 --> 01:30:32,332
At last the door opened, and his servant entered.

943
01:30:34,033 --> 01:30:36,053
"Mr Campbell, sir," said the man.

944
01:30:37,072 --> 01:30:38,672
The colour came back to his cheeks.

945
01:30:39,932 --> 01:30:44,072
"Ask him to come in at once, Francis." He felt himself again.

946
01:30:44,752 --> 01:30:46,012
His fear had gone away.

947
01:30:47,393 --> 01:30:49,492
In a few moments Alan Campbell walked in.

948
01:30:50,252 --> 01:30:52,373
He looked very angry and rather worried.

949
01:30:53,812 --> 01:30:56,713
"Alan! This is kind of you. I thank you for coming."

950
01:30:58,192 --> 01:31:08,452
"I hoped never to enter your house again, Gray. But you said it was a question of life and death." His voice was hard and cold, and he kept his hands in the pockets of his coat.

951
01:31:09,652 --> 01:31:16,033
"Yes, it is a question of life and death, Alan. And to more than one person. Sit down."

952
01:31:17,592 --> 01:31:20,972
Campbell took a chair by the table, and Dorian sat opposite him.

953
01:31:21,772 --> 01:31:23,372
The two men's eyes met.

954
01:31:24,292 --> 01:31:26,312
In Dorian's there was great sadness.

955
01:31:26,893 --> 01:31:29,012
He knew that what he was going to do was terrible.

956
01:31:30,852 --> 01:31:54,031
After a moment of silence, Dorian said very quietly, "Alan, in a locked room at the top of the house, a dead man is sitting at a table. He has been dead for ten hours now. Don't stir, and don't look at me like that. You don't need to know who this man is. You don't need to know how or why he died. What you have to do is this -"

957
01:31:54,111 --> 01:32:06,311
"Stop, Gray. I don't want to know anything more. I don't care if what you tell me is true or not true. I don't want any part in your life. Keep your horrible secrets to yourself. They don't interest me any more."

958
01:32:07,351 --> 01:32:24,412
"Alan, they will have to interest you. I am awfully sorry for you, Alan. But I can't help myself. You are the one man who can save me. Alan, you are a scientist. You know about chemistry, and things of that kind. What you have got to do is to destroy the thing that is upstairs."

959
01:32:25,552 --> 01:32:28,611
"You are mad, Dorian. I will have nothing to do with this."

960
01:32:29,492 --> 01:32:31,091
"He killed himself, Alan."

961
01:32:31,951 --> 01:32:35,751
"I am glad of that. But who made him do it? You, I suppose."

962
01:32:37,091 --> 01:32:37,992
"Do you still refuse

963
01:32:38,031 --> 01:32:38,832
to do this for me?"

964
01:32:39,631 --> 01:32:44,271
"Of course I refuse. You have come to the wrong man. Go to some of your friends. Don't come to me."

965
01:32:45,431 --> 01:32:50,411
"Alan, it was murder. I killed him. You don't know what he made me suffer."

966
01:32:51,371 --> 01:32:56,671
"Murder! Good God, Dorian, is that what you have come to? I will have nothing to do with it."

967
01:32:58,231 --> 01:33:06,831
"You must have something to do with it. Don't ask any more questions. I have told you too much already. But you must do this. We were friends once, Alan."

968
01:33:07,712 --> 01:33:09,951
"Don't speak of those days, Dorian. They are dead."

969
01:33:11,471 --> 01:33:16,251
"They will hang me for this, Alan. Don't you understand? They will kill me for what I have done."

970
01:33:17,392 --> 01:33:18,471
Campbell got up to leave.

971
01:33:19,351 --> 01:33:21,492
"I will not have anything to do with this."

972
01:33:22,631 --> 01:33:23,451
"You refuse?"

973
01:33:24,091 --> 01:33:24,551
"Yes."

974
01:33:26,271 --> 01:33:29,011
The same look of sadness came into Dorian Gray's eyes.

975
01:33:30,032 --> 01:33:32,471
Then he took a piece of paper and wrote something on it.

976
01:33:33,371 --> 01:33:36,731
He read it over and pushed it across the table.

977
01:33:36,791 --> 01:33:40,371
Then he got up and went over to the window.

978
01:33:40,431 --> 01:33:43,511
Campbell looked at him in surprise and picked up the paper.

979
01:33:43,571 --> 01:33:48,151
As he read it, his face went white, and he fell back in his chair.

980
01:33:48,212 --> 01:33:51,831
After two or three minutes without speaking, Dorian came and stood next to him.

981
01:33:53,990 --> 01:33:58,070
"I am very sorry for you, Alan," he said, putting his hand on his shoulder.

982
01:33:58,771 --> 01:34:13,070
"But there is no other way. I have a letter written already. Here it is. You see the address. If you don't help me, I will send it. You know what will happen. But you are going to help me. It is impossible for you to refuse now."

983
01:34:15,350 --> 01:34:17,550
Campbell put his face in his hands.

984
01:34:18,730 --> 01:34:23,270
"The thing is quite simple, Alan. It has to be done. Face it, and do it."

985
01:34:25,050 --> 01:34:27,351
A terrible sound came from Campbell's lips.

986
01:34:28,711 --> 01:34:31,490
"Come, Alan, you must decide now."

987
01:34:34,050 --> 01:34:35,210
Alan paused for a moment.

988
01:34:36,450 --> 01:34:38,410
"Is there a fire in the room upstairs?"

989
01:34:39,230 --> 01:34:40,790
"Yes, there is a gas fire."

990
01:34:42,370 --> 01:34:45,550
"I must go home and get some... things."

991
01:34:46,790 --> 01:34:53,110
"No, Alan, you must not leave the house. Write out what you want, and my servant will get the things for you."

992
01:34:55,270 --> 01:35:01,210
It was nearly two o'clock when the servant returned with an enormous wooden box filled with the things Campbell had asked for.

993
01:35:03,630 --> 01:35:06,270
"You can have the rest of the day to yourself, Francis."

994
01:35:07,570 --> 01:35:08,231
"Thank you, sir."

995
01:35:09,911 --> 01:35:13,410
When the servant had left, the two men carried the box up the stairs.

996
01:35:13,731 --> 01:35:15,810
Dorian took out the key and turned it in the lock.

997
01:35:16,770 --> 01:35:22,070
Then he stopped and Campbell saw that his eyes were full of tears.

998
01:35:22,130 --> 01:35:24,710
"I don't think I can go in, Alan," he said.

999
01:35:26,231 --> 01:35:29,050
"I don't need you," said Campbell coldly.

1000
01:35:30,650 --> 01:35:31,890
Dorian half opened the door.

1001
01:35:33,090 --> 01:35:36,510
As he did so, he saw the face of the portrait staring in the sunlight.

1002
01:35:37,350 --> 01:35:40,050
He remembered that the night before he had forgotten to cover the picture.

1003
01:35:40,871 --> 01:35:43,790
He was about to rush forward when he saw something that made him jump back.

1004
01:35:44,990 --> 01:35:48,790
There was blood on one of the hands in the portrait.

1005
01:35:48,850 --> 01:35:49,930
How horrible it was!

1006
01:35:51,550 --> 01:35:53,949
He hurried into the room, trying not to look at the dead man.

1007
01:35:54,949 --> 01:35:57,329
Picking the curtain off the floor he threw it over the picture.

1008
01:35:58,029 --> 01:36:00,050
Then he rushed out of the room and down the stairs.

1009
01:36:03,549 --> 01:36:06,790
It was long after seven when Campbell came back into the library.

1010
01:36:07,769 --> 01:36:10,710
He was quiet and white in the face, but very calm.

1011
01:36:12,609 --> 01:36:15,509
"I have done what you asked me to do," he said.

1012
01:36:16,650 --> 01:36:20,470
"And now goodbye. Let us never see each other again."

1013
01:36:22,989 --> 01:36:27,589
"You have saved me, Alan. I cannot forget that," said Dorian, simply.

1014
01:36:29,589 --> 01:36:31,609
When Campbell had left he went upstairs.

1015
01:36:32,569 --> 01:36:34,290
There was a horrible smell in the room.

1016
01:36:35,470 --> 01:36:39,189
But the thing that had been sitting at the table was gone.

1017
01:36:43,609 --> 01:36:46,029
CHAPTER TWELVE

1018
01:36:46,069 --> 01:36:47,269
"Why Do You Look so Young?"

1019
01:36:47,349 --> 01:36:50,529
"Don't tell me that you are going to be good," cried Lord Henry.

1020
01:36:50,869 --> 01:36:53,529
"You're quite perfect. Don't change."

1021
01:36:55,130 --> 01:36:56,290
Dorian Gray shook his head.

1022
01:36:56,749 --> 01:37:08,830
"No, Harry, I have done too many terrible things in my life. I am not going to do any more. But tell me, what is happening here in London? I have been out of the country for more than a month."

1023
01:37:10,529 --> 01:37:13,889
"People are still discussing poor Basil's disappearance."

1024
01:37:15,489 --> 01:37:20,509
"Are they not bored with that yet?" said Dorian, pouring out some wine and frowning.

1025
01:37:21,549 --> 01:37:24,889
"My dear boy, they have only been talking about it for six weeks.

1026
01:37:25,449 --> 01:37:50,550
The British only need one subject of conversation every three months. They have been very lucky recently, though. First there was the scandal of my wife leaving me, and then Alan Campbell killed himself. Now there is the mysterious disappearance of an artist. The British police are saying that Basil did take the midnight train on the ninth of November, but the French police are sure that he never arrived in Paris at all."

1027
01:37:53,030 --> 01:37:57,329
"What do you think has happened to Basil?" asked Dorian, holding up his wine against the light.

1028
01:37:58,530 --> 01:38:10,409
"I have no idea. If Basil wants to hide himself, it is no business of mine. If he is dead, I don't want to think about him. Death is the only thing that ever frightens me. I hate it."

1029
01:38:11,869 --> 01:38:14,609
"Why?" said the younger man, in a tired voice.

1030
01:38:15,449 --> 01:38:34,509
"Because," said Lord Henry, "it is the only thing that is final. Let us have our coffee in the music room, Dorian. You must play Chopin to me. The man who ran away with my wife played Chopin beautifully. Poor Victoria! I was very fond of her. The house is quite lonely without her."

1031
01:38:36,849 --> 01:38:40,589
Dorian said nothing, but went into the next room and sat at the piano.

1032
01:38:41,589 --> 01:38:44,709
After the coffee had been brought in, he stopped playing.

1033
01:38:46,929 --> 01:38:50,209
"Harry," he said, looking over at Lord Henry.

1034
01:38:50,269 --> 01:38:51,890
"Do you think Basil was murdered?"

1035
01:38:53,409 --> 01:38:54,409
Lord Henry yawned.

1036
01:38:55,649 --> 01:39:14,630
"Everyone liked Basil. Who would want to murder him? He was not clever enough to have enemies. Of course he was a wonderful painter. But a man can paint like Velasquez and yet still be rather boring. Basil was really rather boring. The only thing that interested me about him was that he worshipped you."

1037
01:39:16,529 --> 01:39:19,730
"I was very fond of Basil," said Dorian sadly.

1038
01:39:21,229 --> 01:39:23,230
"But don't people say he was murdered?"

1039
01:39:23,929 --> 01:39:32,649
"Oh, some newspapers do. But I don't think it is likely. I know there are awful places in Paris, but Basil was not the sort of man to go to them."

1040
01:39:35,209 --> 01:39:41,449
"What would you say, Harry, if I told you that I had murdered Basil?" said the younger man.

1041
01:39:42,789 --> 01:39:46,689
He watched him carefully after he had spoken.

1042
01:39:46,749 --> 01:39:55,708
"No, Dorian, you would not murder anyone. It is ordinary people who murder. It is their way of finding the extraordinary pleasure that art gives us."

1043
01:39:57,168 --> 01:40:05,469
"A way of finding the extraordinary pleasure? Do you think that a man who has murdered could do it again. Don't tell me that."

1044
01:40:06,788 --> 01:40:11,548
"Oh! Anything becomes a pleasure if you do it too often," cried Lord Henry, laughing.

1045
01:40:12,249 --> 01:40:39,649
"That is one of the most important secrets of life. I believe, though, that murder is always a mistake. One should never do anything one cannot talk about after dinner. But let us pass from poor Basil. I wish I could believe that he has died some romantic death, but I can't. He probably fell into the Seine off a bus. I can see him now lying on his back in the dirty green water. During the last ten years he had not been painting well."

1046
01:40:41,868 --> 01:40:46,388
Lord Henry walked across the room and touched the head of a strange grey bird that he kept in the music room.

1047
01:40:47,368 --> 01:40:48,788
Then he turned to face Dorian.

1048
01:40:49,989 --> 01:41:14,128
"Yes," he continued, taking his handkerchief out of his pocket, "his painting seemed to me to have lost something. When you and he stopped being great friends, he stopped being a great artist. What was it that separated you? I suppose he bored you. If so, he never forgave you. By the way, what happened to that wonderful portrait he did of you? I don't think I have ever seen it since he finished it."

1049
01:41:15,768 --> 01:41:19,328
"I told you years ago that it was stolen."

1050
01:41:19,408 --> 01:41:30,548
"Oh! I remember. You never got it back? What a shame! It really was wonderful. I remember I wanted to buy it. I wish I had it now."

1051
01:41:30,628 --> 01:41:32,548
"I never really liked it," said Dorian.

1052
01:41:32,988 --> 01:41:38,329
"I am sorry I sat for it. The memory of the thing is hateful to me."

1053
01:41:38,408 --> 01:41:55,408
"How sad you look! Don't be so serious. Play me some music, Dorian. And, as you play, tell me in a low voice why you still look so young. I am only ten years older than you are, and I have grey hair and yellow skin. You are really wonderful, Dorian."

1054
01:41:56,487 --> 01:41:57,487
"Harry, please -"

1055
01:41:58,187 --> 01:42:12,528
"You have never looked more charming than you do tonight. You remind me of the day I first saw you. You were very shy, and absolutely extraordinary. You have changed, of course, but not in appearance. You are still the same."

1056
01:42:13,727 --> 01:42:15,467
"I am not the same, Harry."

1057
01:42:16,247 --> 01:42:30,107
"Yes, you are the same. I wish I could change places with you, Dorian. The world has cried out against us both, but it has always worshipped you. It always will worship you. Life has been your art."

1058
01:42:32,268 --> 01:42:34,987
Dorian got up from the piano, and passed his hand through his hair.

1059
01:42:36,247 --> 01:42:53,747
"Yes, life has been beautiful," he said, quietly, "but I am not going to have the same life, Harry. And you must not say these things to me. You don't know everything about me. I think that if you did, even you would turn away from me. You laugh. Don't laugh."

1060
01:42:55,387 --> 01:43:13,547
"Why have you stopped playing, Dorian? Let us go to the club. It has been a charming evening, and we must end it charmingly. There is someone I want to introduce to you - young Lord Poole. He has already copied your ties and he very much wants to meet you. He is quite charming and he reminds me of you."

1061
01:43:15,187 --> 01:43:19,288
"I hope not," said Dorian, with a sad look in his eyes.

1062
01:43:19,347 --> 01:43:25,207
"But I am tired tonight, Harry. I won't go to the club. It is nearly eleven, and I want to go to bed early."

1063
01:43:26,527 --> 01:43:30,167
"Please stay. You have never played so well as tonight."

1064
01:43:31,627 --> 01:43:35,627
"It is because I am going to be good," he answered, smiling.

1065
01:43:35,687 --> 01:43:38,727
"I am a little changed already."

1066
01:43:38,807 --> 01:43:42,147
"You can't change to me, Dorian," said Lord Henry.

1067
01:43:42,207 --> 01:43:47,887
"You and I will always be friends. Come round tomorrow. We shall go to lunch."

1068
01:43:47,968 --> 01:43:49,508
"Do you really want me to come, Harry?"

1069
01:43:50,667 --> 01:43:57,468
"Certainly. The park is quite lovely now. I don't think there have been such flowers since the year I met you."

1070
01:43:59,227 --> 01:44:02,428
"Very well. I shall be here at eleven," said Dorian.

1071
01:44:03,408 --> 01:44:04,127
"Good-night, Harry."

1072
01:44:08,447 --> 01:44:09,407
CHAPTER THIRTEEN

1073
01:44:11,467 --> 01:44:11,487
"To Kill the Past"

1074
01:44:11,508 --> 01:44:12,387
It was a lovely night.

1075
01:44:13,547 --> 01:44:16,407
He walked home, with his coat on his arm, smoking his cigarette.

1076
01:44:17,587 --> 01:44:19,307
Two young men in evening dress passed him.

1077
01:44:20,047 --> 01:44:23,888
He heard one of them whisper to the other, "That is Dorian Gray".

1078
01:44:25,528 --> 01:44:29,307
He remembered how pleased he used to be when he was stared at, or talked about.

1079
01:44:30,147 --> 01:44:32,127
He was tired of hearing his own name now.

1080
01:44:33,787 --> 01:44:36,528
When he reached home, he found his servant waiting up for him.

1081
01:44:37,087 --> 01:44:40,487
He sent him to bed, and threw himself down on the sofa in the library.

1082
01:44:41,827 --> 01:44:44,807
He began to think about some of the things that Lord Henry had said to him.

1083
01:44:46,327 --> 01:44:48,547
Was it really true that one could never change?

1084
01:44:49,587 --> 01:44:52,387
There had been a time when he had been good and innocent.

1085
01:44:53,688 --> 01:44:57,427
He had corrupted himself, and become a terrible influence on others.

1086
01:44:58,487 --> 01:45:00,487
He had even got pleasure from this corruption.

1087
01:45:01,567 --> 01:45:03,868
Yet his soul had once been the purest of all.

1088
01:45:04,827 --> 01:45:05,908
Was all that gone?

1089
01:45:06,688 --> 01:45:09,987
Was there no hope for him?

1090
01:45:10,048 --> 01:45:14,188
In one terrible moment of passion, he had asked to stay young for all time.

1091
01:45:14,868 --> 01:45:16,967
All his failure had been because of that.

1092
01:45:17,987 --> 01:45:21,847
He had not been punished, but perhaps punishment was what he had needed.

1093
01:45:22,807 --> 01:45:24,567
Punishment cleaned the soul.

1094
01:45:26,747 --> 01:45:32,627
The mirror that Lord Henry had given to him, so many years ago now, was standing on the table.

1095
01:45:32,688 --> 01:45:38,827
He picked it up, remembering that horrible night when he had first noticed the change in the picture.

1096
01:45:38,887 --> 01:45:43,407
Once, someone who had loved him passionately had written him a mad letter.

1097
01:45:43,467 --> 01:45:56,066
It had ended with these words: "The world is changed because you are made of gold." He repeated them to himself and suddenly realized that he hated his own beauty.

1098
01:45:57,166 --> 01:46:00,666
Throwing the mirror on the floor, he broke the glass into little pieces with his foot.

1099
01:46:01,746 --> 01:46:03,666
It was his beauty that had spoiled him.

1100
01:46:06,166 --> 01:46:07,866
It was better not to think of the past.

1101
01:46:08,326 --> 01:46:09,446
Nothing could change that.

1102
01:46:10,006 --> 01:46:11,387
He had to think of his future.

1103
01:46:12,246 --> 01:46:16,386
Alan Campbell had shot himself one night, and his terrible secret had died with him.

1104
01:46:17,286 --> 01:46:20,387
The interest in Basil Hallward's disappearance would soon pass away.

1105
01:46:20,786 --> 01:46:22,106
He was perfectly safe there.

1106
01:46:23,526 --> 01:46:25,626
What worried him was the death of his own soul.

1107
01:46:26,307 --> 01:46:29,026
Basil had painted the portrait that had destroyed his life.

1108
01:46:29,967 --> 01:46:31,626
He could not forgive him that.

1109
01:46:32,606 --> 01:46:34,586
It was the portrait that had done everything.

1110
01:46:35,346 --> 01:46:37,446
The murder had just been the madness of the moment.

1111
01:46:38,686 --> 01:46:41,346
As for Alan Campbell, he had killed himself.

1112
01:46:41,386 --> 01:46:43,246
It was nothing to do with Dorian Gray.

1113
01:46:45,206 --> 01:46:46,046
A new life!

1114
01:46:46,426 --> 01:46:47,326
That was what he wanted.

1115
01:46:48,006 --> 01:46:49,346
That was what he was waiting for.

1116
01:46:50,666 --> 01:46:52,006
Perhaps it had begun already.

1117
01:46:52,926 --> 01:46:54,886
He would never again spoil innocence.

1118
01:46:54,946 --> 01:46:55,786
He would be good.

1119
01:46:58,026 --> 01:47:00,846
He began to wonder if the portrait in the locked room had changed.

1120
01:47:01,566 --> 01:47:03,366
Was it still as horrible as it had been?

1121
01:47:04,187 --> 01:47:07,886
Perhaps if his life became pure, the face in the portrait would become beautiful again.

1122
01:47:08,547 --> 01:47:09,286
He would go and look.

1123
01:47:10,827 --> 01:47:12,926
He took the lamp from the table and went upstairs.

1124
01:47:14,327 --> 01:47:17,827
As he opened the door, a smile of happiness passed across his young face.

1125
01:47:19,046 --> 01:47:24,626
Yes, he would be good, and the ugly thing he had locked away would not frighten him any more.

1126
01:47:25,986 --> 01:47:28,967
He felt happier already.

1127
01:47:29,026 --> 01:47:33,066
He went in quietly, locking the door behind him.

1128
01:47:33,126 --> 01:47:38,766
Walking straight over to the portrait, he took off the purple curtain that was covering it.

1129
01:47:38,827 --> 01:47:40,886
An angry cry of pain came from him.

1130
01:47:41,626 --> 01:47:42,926
He could see no change.

1131
01:47:43,346 --> 01:47:47,126
The thing was still hateful - more hateful, even, than before.

1132
01:47:47,206 --> 01:47:50,325
The red mark on the hand seemed brighter and more like new blood.

1133
01:47:51,225 --> 01:47:53,386
And why was the red mark larger than it had been?

1134
01:47:54,286 --> 01:47:55,885
It was all over the fingers now.

1135
01:47:56,866 --> 01:48:00,985
There was blood on the painted feet, and blood on the hand that had not held the knife.

1136
01:48:02,226 --> 01:48:03,225
What did it all mean?

1137
01:48:04,445 --> 01:48:05,806
That he should go to the police?

1138
01:48:06,345 --> 01:48:08,745
That he should tell the whole story, and be put to death?

1139
01:48:09,965 --> 01:48:10,645
He laughed.

1140
01:48:11,005 --> 01:48:12,445
He felt the idea was absurd.

1141
01:48:13,165 --> 01:48:15,325
If he did tell them now, who would believe him?

1142
01:48:16,285 --> 01:48:18,485
There was nothing left of the murdered man anywhere.

1143
01:48:19,085 --> 01:48:21,705
He had destroyed everything belonging to Basil Hallward.

1144
01:48:22,605 --> 01:48:24,685
He himself had burned the bag and the coat.

1145
01:48:25,505 --> 01:48:27,265
They would simply say he was mad.

1146
01:48:29,125 --> 01:48:31,345
Was this murder to follow him all his life?

1147
01:48:32,025 --> 01:48:34,325
Was he always going to suffer because of his past?

1148
01:48:35,525 --> 01:48:36,385
Yet what could he do?

1149
01:48:37,265 --> 01:48:38,225
Go to the police?

1150
01:48:39,246 --> 01:48:39,605
Never.

1151
01:48:41,545 --> 01:48:45,845
There was only one thing they could use against him and that was the picture itself.

1152
01:48:46,845 --> 01:48:47,745
He would destroy it.

1153
01:48:48,566 --> 01:48:49,945
Why had he kept it so long?

1154
01:48:51,005 --> 01:48:53,905
Once it had given him pleasure to watch it changing and growing old.

1155
01:48:54,966 --> 01:48:56,805
Recently he had felt no such pleasure.

1156
01:48:57,066 --> 01:48:58,305
It had kept him awake at night.

1157
01:48:58,825 --> 01:49:01,886
When he had been away, he had been frightened that another person would see it.

1158
01:49:02,985 --> 01:49:05,445
Just the memory of it spoiled many moments of happiness.

1159
01:49:06,185 --> 01:49:07,185
He would destroy it.

1160
01:49:08,926 --> 01:49:11,705
He looked around and saw the knife that had killed Basil Hallward.

1161
01:49:12,566 --> 01:49:15,865
He had cleaned it many times until there was no mark left on it.

1162
01:49:16,705 --> 01:49:19,185
It was bright, and it shone.

1163
01:49:19,246 --> 01:49:20,345
It had killed the painter.

1164
01:49:20,965 --> 01:49:23,945
Now it would kill the painter's work, and all that it meant.

1165
01:49:24,365 --> 01:49:26,445
It would kill the past.

1166
01:49:26,505 --> 01:49:30,825
When that was dead he would be free.

1167
01:49:30,886 --> 01:49:36,645
He picked up the knife and pushed it into the picture.

1168
01:49:36,705 --> 01:49:39,105
There was a cry, and a crash.

1169
01:49:40,165 --> 01:49:45,085
The cry was so horrible that frightened servants woke and came out of their rooms.

1170
01:49:45,145 --> 01:49:49,185
Two gentlemen, who were passing in the Square below, stopped, and looked up at the great house.

1171
01:49:50,144 --> 01:49:52,584
They hurried on until they met a policeman, and brought him back.

1172
01:49:53,665 --> 01:49:57,064
The policeman rang the bell several times, but there was no answer.

1173
01:49:58,425 --> 01:50:01,665
Except for a light in one of the top windows, the house was all dark.

1174
01:50:03,604 --> 01:50:07,364
After a time, he went away and stood in the garden of the next house and watched.

1175
01:50:09,325 --> 01:50:12,264
"Whose house is that?" asked the older of the two gentlemen.

1176
01:50:13,364 --> 01:50:16,205
"Mr Dorian Gray's, sir," answered the policeman.

1177
01:50:17,924 --> 01:50:21,204
They looked at each other as they walked away, and laughed cruelly.

1178
01:50:22,144 --> 01:50:24,024
They knew who Dorian Gray was.

1179
01:50:26,184 --> 01:50:29,324
Inside the house the servants were talking in low whispers to each other.

1180
01:50:30,304 --> 01:50:31,745
Old Mrs Leaf was crying.

1181
01:50:32,804 --> 01:50:34,944
Francis was as white as death.

1182
01:50:37,344 --> 01:50:40,164
After about a quarter of an hour, they went fearfully upstairs.

1183
01:50:41,225 --> 01:50:43,084
They knocked, but there was no reply.

1184
01:50:44,205 --> 01:50:44,944
They called out.

1185
01:50:46,104 --> 01:50:47,184
Everything was still.

1186
01:50:48,624 --> 01:50:49,484
They tried the door.

1187
01:50:50,364 --> 01:50:51,064
It was locked.

1188
01:50:52,784 --> 01:50:55,944
Finally, they got on the roof and came into the room through the window.

1189
01:50:58,144 --> 01:51:01,904
When they entered the room they found a portrait hanging on the wall.

1190
01:51:03,065 --> 01:51:08,264
It showed Mr Dorian Gray as they had last seen him, young and beautiful.

1191
01:51:09,705 --> 01:51:13,925
Lying on the floor was a dead man in evening dress.

1192
01:51:13,984 --> 01:51:15,484
He had a knife in his heart.

1193
01:51:17,544 --> 01:51:22,344
He was old and horribly ugly.

1194
01:51:22,404 --> 01:51:26,724
It was not until they saw his rings that they recognized who the man was.
