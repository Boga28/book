CHAPTER ONE
Meet Maxim de Winter

2
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:09,340
What would I be today if I had not gone to
Monte Carlo with Mrs Van Hopper?

3
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,360
I would have lived another life.

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,599
I would have become a different person.

5
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:16,500
Mrs Van Hopper was not a pleasant woman.

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,770
She loved to meet people who were rich and
famous.

7
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:25,060
Every summer, Mrs Van Hopper stayed at the
Hotel Cote d'Azur, the biggest and most expensive

8
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:26,820
hotel in Monte Carlo.

9
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:31,140
Here, Mrs Van Hopper found out which well-known
people were staying in the town.

10
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,090
She always found an excuse to speak to them.

11
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:39,890
Then, pretending to know them well, she asked
her victims rude questions in her loud American

12
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:41,190
voice.

13
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:42,370
I was young and shy.

14
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:48,180
I hated my life with Mrs Van Hopper, but she
paid me a little money to be her companion.

15
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,390
I was not exactly a servant and certainly
not a friend.

16
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:56,340
We must have looked a strange pair as we walked
into the hotel restaurant that day.

17
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:59,570
Mrs Van Hopper walked in front of me on her
high-heeled shoes.

18
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:03,970
Her fat, heavy body swayed above her short
fat legs.

19
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:07,770
I followed slowly, my eyes looking down at
the floor.

20
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:12,950
With my straight hair and badly-fitting clothes
I looked like an awkward schoolgirl.

21
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:18,000
Mrs Van Hopper sat down at her usual table
and stared at everyone in the restaurant.

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,890
'There isn't one well-known person here,'
she said in her loud voice.

23
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:25,380
'There's no one I want to talk to.'

24
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:28,320
Mrs Van Hopper was very greedy.

25
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,240
She ordered a large lunch for herself.

26
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,310
Soon she was eating a large plateful of spaghetti.

27
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:35,620
We ate in silence.

28
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:38,229
The rich sauce ran down Mrs Van Hopper's chin.

29
00:01:38,229 --> 00:01:40,650
I looked away.

30
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:44,060
Then I saw that a new guest was sitting down
at the next table.

31
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:45,800
Mrs Van Hopper saw him too.

32
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,970
She put down her fork and stared at him hard.

33
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:52,530
How an excited look come into her small eyes.

34
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:54,840
'It's Max de Winter,' she said to me.

35
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,920
'The man who owns Manderley.

36
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:00,990
You must have heard of it - a beautiful old
house in the west of England.

37
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:03,210
He looks ill, doesn't he?

38
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:05,380
His wife died suddenly last year.

39
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:06,979
They say he's broken hearted.'

40
00:02:06,979 --> 00:02:10,840
I felt sorry for de Winter already.

41
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,739
He was Mrs Van Hopper's next victim.

42
00:02:12,739 --> 00:02:16,090
She finished her meal as quickly as possible.

43
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:17,870
I knew what she was going to do.

44
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:23,620
There was a long seat in the hotel lounge,
with a low table in front of it.

45
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:27,510
The seat was between the restaurant and the
main door of the hotel.

46
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:30,349
Everyone who left the restaurant had to walk
past this seat.

47
00:02:30,349 --> 00:02:36,560
'I'll take my coffee in the lounge,' Mrs Van
Hopper told the waiter, 'straight away.'

48
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,900
She turned to me, her eyes shining: 'Go upstairs
and find that letter from my nephew, Billy.

49
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:45,440
Bring it to me in the lounge and the photographs
too.

50
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,020
Billy met Max de Winter in London.

51
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:49,270
Be quick.'

52
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:53,410
I went up to Mrs Van Hopper's rooms as slowly
as I could.

53
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:56,430
I hoped that de Winter would get away before
I returned.

54
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:01,410
When I came back with the letter, Mrs Van
Hopper was already on the seat in the lounge.

55
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:03,820
De Winter was sitting next to her.

56
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:06,550
He was a dark-haired, handsome man.

57
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:10,290
His face was pale and his dark eyes had a
sad, lost look.

58
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:14,250
De Winter stood up politely as I gave Mrs
Van Hopper her letter.

59
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:16,849
'Mr de Winter is having coffee with us.

60
00:03:16,849 --> 00:03:21,800
Go and ask the waiter for another cup,' Mrs
Van Hopper told me.

61
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,730
'No, you are my guests,' said de Winter.

62
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:25,750
He called the waiter.

63
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:31,599
In a moment, de Winter was sitting on a small
chair and I was next to Mrs Van Hopper on

64
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:32,840
the long seat.

65
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:36,520
'I recognized you at once,' Mrs Van Hopper
said.

66
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:39,990
'I met you at my nephew's party, in London.

67
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:43,010
But I don't suppose you remember an old woman
like me?'

68
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:46,840
And Mrs Van Hopper gave de Winter one of her
biggest smiles.

69
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:52,970
'You are wrong, I could never forget you,'
said de Winter in a cold, hard voice.

70
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:56,730
'Billy's on holiday now,' Mrs Van Hopper went
on.

71
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:57,790
'He loves travelling.

72
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:02,110
But if he had a home like Manderley, he would
never leave it.

73
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:06,269
People say that Manderley's one of the most
beautiful houses in England.

74
00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:10,140
I wonder what you are doing here in Monte
Carlo?'

75
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,780
For a few moments there was silence.

76
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:14,159
Then de Winter spoke.

77
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,169
'Manderley was looking very lovely when I
came away.'

78
00:04:17,169 --> 00:04:19,079
There was another silence.

79
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:22,860
De Winter had not answered Mrs Van Hopper's
question.

80
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,930
She was not silent for long, of course.

81
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:30,009
She started to tell de Winter all the unpleasant
gossip of Monte Carlo.

82
00:04:30,009 --> 00:04:33,150
After his moment of rudeness, de Winter listened
to her politely.

83
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:37,520
I looked down at the floor and tried not to
hear Mrs Van Hopper's loud voice.

84
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,550
At last she had to stop.

85
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:42,229
A waiter came up to her with a message.

86
00:04:42,229 --> 00:04:45,689
Mrs Van Hopper's dressmaker was waiting for
her upstairs.

87
00:04:45,689 --> 00:04:47,729
De Winter stood up at once.

88
00:04:47,729 --> 00:04:50,650
'You mustn't keep your dressmaker waiting,'
he said.

89
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:52,439
Mrs Van Hopper smiled.

90
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:55,000
'You must have a drink with me,' she said.

91
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,969
'Why not tomorrow evening?

92
00:04:56,969 --> 00:04:58,449
I'm having a few friends...'

93
00:04:58,449 --> 00:05:00,839
'I'm sorry,' de Winter said quickly.

94
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:03,139
'I shall be away all day tomorrow.

95
00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:04,139
If you will excuse me...'

96
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:06,979
He turned and walked out of the lounge.

97
00:05:06,979 --> 00:05:12,800
'What a strange man Max de Winter is,' said
Mrs Van Hopper when we were standing in the

98
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,800
lift.

99
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,029
'He left so suddenly.

100
00:05:15,029 --> 00:05:18,099
But he is certainly an attractive man.

101
00:05:18,099 --> 00:05:21,169
By the way, dear, you were rather rude to
him.

102
00:05:21,169 --> 00:05:22,899
You must look at people when they are speaking.

103
00:05:22,899 --> 00:05:25,360
You are not a child, you know.'

104
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,199
Mrs Van Hopper was soon busy with her dressmaker.

105
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,999
I sat on a window seat, looking at the bright
day outside.

106
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,430
I could not go out.

107
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:36,710
Some of Mrs Van Hopper's friends were coming
to tea.

108
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:39,180
They were fat, rude women like herself.

109
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:44,759
My job was to talk to them, light their cigarettes
and tidy the room after they had gone.

110
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:47,330
There was a knock on the door.

111
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:50,020
A waiter came in with a note in his hand.

112
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:51,499
'Madame is in the bedroom,' I told him.

113
00:05:51,499 --> 00:05:54,099
But the note was for me.

114
00:05:54,099 --> 00:05:57,889
There were a few words in an unknown handwriting.

115
00:05:57,889 --> 00:05:59,969
'Forgive me.

116
00:05:59,969 --> 00:06:01,809
I was very rude after lunch.'

117
00:06:01,809 --> 00:06:05,960
The note was not signed, but I knew it was
from de Winter.

118
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,110
'Is there an answer?'

119
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:09,710
the waiter asked me.

120
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:10,869
I looked up.

121
00:06:10,869 --> 00:06:11,869
'No.

122
00:06:11,869 --> 00:06:15,219
No answer,' I said.

123
00:06:15,219 --> 00:06:18,050
After the waiter had gone, I put the note
in my pocket.

124
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:20,929
Mrs Van Hopper called me from her bedroom.

125
00:06:20,929 --> 00:06:29,319
I got up slowly, thinking about de Winter
and about Manderley.

126
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:44,080
CHAPTER TWO
A Day Out Together

127
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,580
The following day, Mrs Van Hopper woke up
with a sore throat and a high temperature.

128
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:52,169
I rang up her doctor and he came round at
once.

129
00:06:52,169 --> 00:06:55,520
'You have flu, Madame,' the doctor told her.

130
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,580
'You won't get better unless you stay quietly
in bed.

131
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,709
Your heart isn't strong.

132
00:07:00,709 --> 00:07:02,839
You'll need a nurse to look after you.

133
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:05,620
You must stay in bed for a week or two.'

134
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:08,319
'I'm sure I could look after Mrs Van Hopper,'
I said.

135
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,979
But the doctor said no.

136
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:13,530
To my surprise, Mrs Van Hopper agreed with
him.

137
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:16,370
Monte Carlo had begun to bore her.

138
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:17,959
She would enjoy staying in bed.

139
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:21,680
She would enjoy giving orders to the nurse
as well as to me.

140
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,830
The nurse soon arrived and I was no longer
wanted.

141
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:28,459
I went down to the restaurant by myself.

142
00:07:28,459 --> 00:07:29,550
I was glad to be alone.

143
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:33,529
It was half an hour before our usual lunch-time.

144
00:07:33,529 --> 00:07:34,949
The restaurant was almost empty.

145
00:07:34,949 --> 00:07:36,860
I went to our usual table.

146
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:40,129
Then I saw that de Winter was already at his
table.

147
00:07:40,129 --> 00:07:42,679
It was too late for me to go back.

148
00:07:42,679 --> 00:07:46,800
I sat down awkwardly trying not to look at
him.

149
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,610
As I picked up the menu, I knocked over the
flowers on the table.

150
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:54,389
The water went all over the cloth and ran
down on to my skirt.

151
00:07:54,389 --> 00:07:57,110
The waiter was at the other end of the restaurant
and saw nothing.

152
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:00,059
In a moment, de Winter was standing by my
chair.

153
00:08:00,059 --> 00:08:03,740
'You can't sit here now,' he said.

154
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:06,020
He called to the waiter who came up at once.

155
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:09,029
'Lay another place at my table,' de Winter
said.

156
00:08:09,029 --> 00:08:11,259
'This lady is lunching with me.'

157
00:08:11,259 --> 00:08:13,099
'Oh no,' I said.

158
00:08:13,099 --> 00:08:14,099
'I couldn't...'

159
00:08:14,099 --> 00:08:15,099
'Why not?' he said.

160
00:08:15,099 --> 00:08:17,949
'I want you to have lunch with me.

161
00:08:17,949 --> 00:08:19,619
I was going to ask you anyway.

162
00:08:19,619 --> 00:08:21,340
Come and sit down.

163
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:24,449
You needn't talk if you don't want to.'

164
00:08:24,449 --> 00:08:28,710
We ordered our food and sat for a time in
a pleasant, easy silence.

165
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:30,610
'What's happened to your friend?'

166
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:31,689
de Winter asked me.

167
00:08:31,689 --> 00:08:34,610
I told him about Mrs Van Hopper's illness.

168
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:37,860
'I'm sorry,' he said politely.

169
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:40,460
'You got my note, I suppose.

170
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:43,430
It's very kind of you to lunch with me after
my rudeness.'

171
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:46,279
'You were not rude,' I said.

172
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:48,930
'At least, she did not think you were.

173
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:52,600
She is always so curious about anyone important.'

174
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,839
'Important?

175
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:55,790
Why does she think that I'm important?'

176
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:57,570
de Winter asked.

177
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:00,610
'I think it's because of Manderley,' I said.

178
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:02,230
He did not answer.

179
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:05,300
I felt that he did not want to talk about
his home.

180
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:09,459
'Your friend is very different from you,'
he said at last.

181
00:09:09,459 --> 00:09:11,110
'And she's much older than you too.

182
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:13,279
Is she a relation?'

183
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,670
'Mrs Van Hopper is not my friend,' I said.

184
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:16,670
'I work for her.

185
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:20,430
I have to, I need the money.

186
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:23,350
I have no family and there is nothing else
I can do.'

187
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:26,209
De Winter asked me more questions about myself.

188
00:09:26,209 --> 00:09:28,500
I forgot my shyness.

189
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,500
I told him about my father, who had been a
painter.

190
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,570
I talked about my mother and her great love
for my father.

191
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:40,360
When my father had died very suddenly, my
mother had lived only a few weeks after him.

192
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:43,730
I suddenly realized that we had been sitting
at the table for more than an hour.

193
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:45,829
I began to apologize.

194
00:09:45,829 --> 00:09:50,240
'But I've enjoyed this hour so much,' de Winter
said.

195
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,680
'We are alike in some ways.

196
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,230
We are both alone in the world.

197
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:57,019
I have a sister, but that's all.'

198
00:09:57,019 --> 00:10:02,639
'You forget,' I told him, 'that you have a
home and I have none.'

199
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:08,580
'An empty house, even a very beautiful one,
can be lonely,' de Winter said.

200
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:12,629
I thought for a moment that he was going to
tell me about Manderley.

201
00:10:12,629 --> 00:10:17,459
But instead he said, 'Well, I suppose you
have a holiday this afternoon.

202
00:10:17,459 --> 00:10:20,250
What are you going to do?'

203
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:22,820
I told him that I was going to do some sketching.

204
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,803
I wanted to draw some of the old houses in
a nearby town.

205
00:10:24,803 --> 00:10:27,459
The bus left at half past two.

206
00:10:27,459 --> 00:10:31,310
'I'll drive you there in my car,' de Winter
said.

207
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:33,740
'Go upstairs and get your coat.'

208
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:35,670
I got my things very quietly.

209
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:38,529
I did not want Mrs Van Hopper to hear me.

210
00:10:38,529 --> 00:10:41,940
I ran down the stairs, holding my gloves in
one hand.

211
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:44,269
I felt excited and grown-up.

212
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:46,850
I did not feel shy with de Winter.

213
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:48,490
He enjoyed my company.

214
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:51,740
He had asked me to go out with him in his
car.

215
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:53,579
We soon reached the place where I wanted to
sketch.

216
00:10:53,579 --> 00:10:57,220
But the wind was too strong - it blew the
paper away.

217
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:01,550
We got into the car again and drove on, up
the steep mountain road.

218
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:04,370
Then suddenly the road came to an end.

219
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:06,220
De Winter stopped the car at the very edge.

220
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:08,420
Far below us lay the sea.

221
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:12,529
I felt cold and a little afraid.

222
00:11:12,529 --> 00:11:14,810
'Do you know this place?'

223
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:15,810
I said.

224
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:18,010
'Have you been here before?'

225
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,839
De Winter looked at me as though I were a
stranger.

226
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:21,879
He was lost in the past.

227
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:25,810
There was a strange, faraway look on his face.

228
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:30,079
He looked like a man walking in his sleep.

229
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:32,120
'It's getting late, shall we go home?'

230
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,120
I said.

231
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,790
Then he looked at me and smiled.

232
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:37,759
'I'm sorry,' he said.

233
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:40,000
'I should not have brought you up here.

234
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,339
Yes, I have been here before, many years ago.'

235
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:47,550
Those years seemed to stretch between us.

236
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:51,699
For the first time, I wished that I had not
come.

237
00:11:51,699 --> 00:11:55,629
De Winter turned the car carefully, and we
drove down the twisting road again.

238
00:11:55,629 --> 00:11:58,449
The sun was setting now and the air was cold
and clear.

239
00:11:58,449 --> 00:12:03,459
Then, at last, he began to talk about Manderley.

240
00:12:03,459 --> 00:12:07,639
He did not talk about his life there, but
about the house itself.

241
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:10,910
He told me about the gardens and the flowers
in the woods.

242
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:12,250
He told me about the sea.

243
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:17,800
It was so near that the sound of its waters
could always be heard from the house.

244
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,910
He told me about a little, secret valley close
to the sea.

245
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:28,339
This little valley, hidden away from the world,
was full of the scent of flowers.

246
00:12:28,339 --> 00:12:30,440
Then we were back in Monte Carlo.

247
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,320
We drove slowly through the brightly lit streets
towards the hotel.

248
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:36,300
I took my gloves from the shelf of the car.

249
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,350
There was a book there.

250
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:40,420
I looked at it, trying to read the title.

251
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:45,339
'You can take the book and look at it, if
you like,' de Winter said.

252
00:12:45,339 --> 00:12:49,089
I was glad and I held the book tightly in
my hand.

253
00:12:49,089 --> 00:12:52,589
I wanted to have something of his now that
our day was over.

254
00:12:52,589 --> 00:12:56,389
'Out you get,' he said, 'I must put the car
away.

255
00:12:56,389 --> 00:12:57,680
I won't see you tonight.

256
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,699
I shall be out.

257
00:12:58,699 --> 00:13:01,779
But thank you for today.'

258
00:13:01,779 --> 00:13:03,829
I walked slowly up the hotel steps.

259
00:13:03,829 --> 00:13:07,339
I felt like a child going home after a party.

260
00:13:07,339 --> 00:13:10,509
I thought of the long hours to bedtime.

261
00:13:10,509 --> 00:13:14,449
I could not meet Mrs Van Hopper and answer
the endless questions.

262
00:13:14,449 --> 00:13:17,670
I went into the lounge and ordered tea.

263
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:20,100
The waiter brought me tea that was nearly
cold.

264
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,540
The sandwiches were dry, but I ate them without
thinking.

265
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:26,180
In my mind I was with Max de Winter at Manderley.

266
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:31,319
If he loved his home so much, why had he left
it?

267
00:13:31,319 --> 00:13:33,389
I picked up the book he had given me.

268
00:13:33,389 --> 00:13:35,779
It was a book of poems.

269
00:13:35,779 --> 00:13:40,959
On the front page there was some writing - hard,
clear writing in black ink:

270
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:45,829
"Max - from Rebecca, 17th May."

271
00:13:45,829 --> 00:13:48,990
The name Rebecca stood out black and strong.

272
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:51,699
The "R" was tall, much bigger than the other
letters.

273
00:13:51,699 --> 00:13:54,279
I shut the book quickly.

274
00:13:54,279 --> 00:13:58,389
I remembered what Mrs Van Hopper had told
me about de Winter's wife.

275
00:13:58,389 --> 00:14:01,110
'It was dreadful,' she had said.

276
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:03,070
'Her death was in all the newspapers.

277
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:06,779
They say he never talks about it, never says
her name.

278
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:12,290
Rebecca was drowned, you know, in the sea
near Manderley.'

279
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:15,180
I stood up slowly, the book in my hand.

280
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:22,430
I walked unhappily to the lift and back to
Mrs Van Hopper.

281
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:32,079
CHAPTER THREE
In Love

282
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:36,600
I was twenty-one and de Winter was the first
man I had ever loved.

283
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,250
First love is not always happy.

284
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:41,860
It can sometimes be like a terrible illness.

285
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:44,779
Mrs Van Hopper had been in bed for about ten
days.

286
00:14:44,779 --> 00:14:47,730
She was bored now, and more bad tempered than
usual.

287
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:49,300
She asked me what I had been doing.

288
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:54,129
'You haven't got enough to do and so you are
doing nothing,' she said unpleasantly.

289
00:14:54,129 --> 00:14:56,759
'You never have any drawings to show me.

290
00:14:56,759 --> 00:14:59,769
When I ask you to do some shopping, you always
forget something.

291
00:14:59,769 --> 00:15:03,129
You are getting lazy without me to watch you.'

292
00:15:03,129 --> 00:15:04,220
I did not reply.

293
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:08,920
I could not tell Mrs Van Hopper that every
morning I drove with de Winter in his car.

294
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,540
Every day I had lunch with him at his table.

295
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:16,790
I have forgotten the places we went to, but
I have not forgotten the excitement of those

296
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:17,790
mornings.

297
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:21,820
I remember how I ran down the stairs because
the lift was too slow.

298
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:24,399
He was always waiting in his car, reading
the paper.

299
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:30,160
When he saw me, he would smile and say, 'Well,
how is the companion this morning?

300
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,040
Where would you like to go?'

301
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:36,269
If we had driven round-in circles, I would
not have cared.

302
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:39,480
I was happy to sit next to him, to be alone
with him.

303
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,600
But the time always went too quickly.

304
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,069
There was a clock in the car.

305
00:15:44,069 --> 00:15:47,629
I could not help looking at it as we drove
along.

306
00:15:47,629 --> 00:15:52,339
'If only we could keep our memories like scent
in a bottle,' I said one day.

307
00:15:52,339 --> 00:15:57,029
'And then we could open the bottle when we
wanted to remember the moment again.'

308
00:15:57,029 --> 00:15:58,830
'And what moment would you like to keep?'

309
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:00,660
de Winter said with a smile.

310
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,980
'I'm not sure,' I began.

311
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:08,140
Then I said quickly, 'I'd like to keep this
moment and never forget it.'

312
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:09,959
De Winter laughed.

313
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:13,100
I suddenly felt very young and very silly.

314
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:19,170
'I wish,' I said angrily, '... I wish I was
a woman of about thirty-six.

315
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:22,259
I wish I was wearing a lot of make-up and
had expensive clothes.'

316
00:16:22,259 --> 00:16:26,809
'You would not be in this car now if you were
like that,' he said.

317
00:16:26,809 --> 00:16:30,699
'Why do you ask me to come out in your car,
day after day?'

318
00:16:30,699 --> 00:16:31,939
I said.

319
00:16:31,939 --> 00:16:33,899
'I'm young, I know nothing.

320
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:37,129
I am not an interesting person at all.

321
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:38,869
You know all about me now.

322
00:16:38,869 --> 00:16:40,430
I have told you everything.

323
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:45,649
But I know nothing about you, nothing - except
that you live at Manderley and... and that

324
00:16:45,649 --> 00:16:48,420
your wife is dead.'

325
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:51,529
I had said the words, at last.

326
00:16:51,529 --> 00:16:52,839
Your wife.

327
00:16:52,839 --> 00:16:54,149
Your wife.

328
00:16:54,149 --> 00:16:55,180
He would never forgive me.

329
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:58,319
I shall never drive with him again, I thought.

330
00:16:58,319 --> 00:17:01,119
He slowed down the car and we stopped by the
side of the road.

331
00:17:01,119 --> 00:17:03,110
Then he turned to me and spoke.

332
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:07,470
'A little while ago, you said you wanted to
keep your memories.

333
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:09,949
For me, it is different.

334
00:17:09,949 --> 00:17:12,549
All my memories are unhappy.

335
00:17:12,549 --> 00:17:15,120
I want to forget them.

336
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:18,250
Something happened a year ago that changed
my whole life.

337
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:22,140
I want to forget everything that happened
to me before that time.

338
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:24,699
That's why I came to Monte Carlo.

339
00:17:24,699 --> 00:17:28,189
If you had not been here, I would have left
long ago.

340
00:17:28,189 --> 00:17:30,580
I ask you to drive with me because I like
you.

341
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:32,140
I enjoy your company.

342
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:37,030
If you don't believe me, you can get out of
the car now.'

343
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:38,440
I sat very still.

344
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,100
I could not speak.

345
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:43,320
I could feel the tears coming into my eyes.

346
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:48,140
'I want to go home now,' I said.

347
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:50,350
Without a word, he started the car and we
drove on.

348
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:53,760
The tears began to run down my cheeks.

349
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,659
Suddenly de Winter took my hand and kissed
it.

350
00:17:56,659 --> 00:17:59,029
Then he gave me his handkerchief.

351
00:17:59,029 --> 00:18:01,409
I wiped my red eyes.

352
00:18:01,409 --> 00:18:03,530
I had never felt more alone.

353
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:08,220
'To hell with this,' he said and put his arm
round my shoulders.

354
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:12,520
'You are so young, I don't know how to speak
to you.

355
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,929
Forget everything I told you.

356
00:18:13,929 --> 00:18:15,750
Let's start again.

357
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:18,090
My family always call me Maxim.

358
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:21,120
I'd like you to call me that too.'

359
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,610
I smiled then, and he laughed back at me.

360
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:26,340
The morning was happy again.

361
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:29,580
The afternoon with Mrs Van Hopper did not
matter.

362
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:33,029
I could look forward to tomorrow morning and
the morning after.

363
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:35,120
I could call him Maxim.

364
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,660
He had kissed me.

365
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:42,210
I had to play cards with Mrs Van Hopper that
afternoon, but I was still happy.

366
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:47,990
When we had finished our game, Mrs Van Hopper
said, 'Tell me, is Max de Winter still in

367
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:49,190
the hotel?'

368
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:50,190
'Yes.

369
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:52,220
Yes, I think so.

370
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:56,350
He comes into the restaurant sometimes,' I
said.

371
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:58,360
Someone has told her, I thought.

372
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,429
Someone has seen us together.

373
00:19:00,429 --> 00:19:02,200
I waited for her to ask more questions.

374
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,520
But she did not.

375
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:08,490
'He's an attractive man,' she said, 'but not
easy to know.

376
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:10,380
I never saw his wife.

377
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,809
People say she was very lovely.

378
00:19:12,809 --> 00:19:16,750
She was clever too, and always beautifully
dressed, of course.

379
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,809
Her death was very sudden.

380
00:19:18,809 --> 00:19:21,620
Everyone says he adored her.'

381
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,279
I did not answer.

382
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:27,250
I was thinking about Rebecca - beautiful and
clever.

383
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:28,990
People could not forget her.

384
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:33,270
Somehow, she and her beauty had not died.

385
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:36,750
In my bedroom was a book that Rebecca had
held in her hands.

386
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,570
His family called him Maxim.

387
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:40,730
Rebecca had called him Max.

388
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:43,399
I thought of the writing on that page.

389
00:19:43,399 --> 00:19:45,919
It was bold and full of life.

390
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:48,870
Rebecca was all the things that I would never
be.

391
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:52,890
I thought of all the letters Rebecca had written
to her husband.

392
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:55,529
They must have been full of the life they
had shared.

393
00:19:55,529 --> 00:19:58,230
I thought I could hear her voice calling him.

394
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:00,260
She called him Max.

395
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,830
It was her special name for him.

396
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:10,870
And I had to call him Maxim.

397
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:15,611
CHAPTER FOUR
I Leave Monte Carlo

398
00:20:15,611 --> 00:20:20,019
Two days later, everything had changed.

399
00:20:20,019 --> 00:20:23,519
Mrs Van Hopper and I were ready to leave Monte
Carlo.

400
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:25,059
All the trunks and bags were packed.

401
00:20:25,059 --> 00:20:27,870
All the drawers and cupboards were empty.

402
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:32,180
Mrs Van Hopper had read a letter from her
daughter at breakfast.

403
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:34,200
'Helen is sailing for New York on Saturday.

404
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,640
Her child's ill.

405
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,500
We are going too.

406
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,720
I'm tired of living here.

407
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,910
How would you like to see New York?'

408
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:46,320
The thought of leaving Monte Carlo and Maxim
de Winter was a terrible one.

409
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,860
My unhappiness must have shown on my face.

410
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:53,090
'What a strange child you are,' Mrs Van Hopper
said.

411
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:54,610
'I can't understand you.

412
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:56,880
I thought you didn't like Monte Carlo.'

413
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,760
'I've got used to it,' I said.

414
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,670
'Well, you'll have to get used to New York,
that's all.

415
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:04,890
We're going on the same boat as Helen.

416
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:06,880
You'll have to arrange everything at once.

417
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,640
Go down to the hotel office now.

418
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,000
You will be too busy to feel unhappy.'

419
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,730
She laughed unpleasantly at my sad face.

420
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:16,000
She walked over to the telephone.

421
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,010
She wanted to tell everyone that she was leaving.

422
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:21,980
I went into the bathroom and locked the door.

423
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:24,850
I wanted to be alone for a few minutes.

424
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:27,500
My happiness was at an end.

425
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:30,170
By tomorrow evening, I should be on the train.

426
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:34,010
The train would carry me away from Maxim,
mile by mile.

427
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:38,260
He would be sitting in the restaurant, reading
perhaps and not thinking of me.

428
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:40,401
Where would I say goodbye to him?

429
00:21:40,401 --> 00:21:45,020
In the lounge, with Mrs Van Hopper standing
near?

430
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:47,429
I was going and everything was over.

431
00:21:47,429 --> 00:21:51,460
We would say goodbye like two strangers.

432
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:53,750
Mrs Van Hopper knocked on the bathroom door.

433
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,850
'What are you doing in there?'

434
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:56,850
she said.

435
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:58,730
'There's no time to dream this morning.

436
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:01,170
There's too much to be done.'

437
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:04,980
I washed my face with cold water and came
out of the bathroom at once.

438
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:08,320
I spent the rest of the day packing and arranging
the journey.

439
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:12,010
In the evening, Mrs Van Hopper's friends came
to say goodbye.

440
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:15,780
We had dinner upstairs and Mrs Van Hopper
went to bed early.

441
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:18,779
I had not seen Maxim all day.

442
00:22:18,779 --> 00:22:21,470
I went down to the lounge at half past nine.

443
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:22,820
A waiter saw me.

444
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:25,080
He knew who I was looking for, of course.

445
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:28,450
'Mr de Winter is out this evening,' he told
me.

446
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:32,070
'He will not be back before midnight.'

447
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:35,000
I walked slowly back up the stairs.

448
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Tomorrow would be too late.

449
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,190
I should not be able to speak to him at all.

450
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:40,940
That night I cried.

451
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:44,610
My pillow was wet with tears.

452
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:47,919
In the morning, my eyes were red and swollen.

453
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:52,190
'You haven't got a cold, have you?' said Mrs
Van Hopper when she saw my face.

454
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:55,750
'No,' I said, 'I don't think so.'

455
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,919
I tried not to look at her.

456
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:02,539
'I hate waiting around when everything is
packed,' Mrs Van Hopper said bad temperedly.

457
00:23:02,539 --> 00:23:05,600
'We ought to have gone on the earlier train.'

458
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,230
She looked at her watch.

459
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:09,380
'I think we could still catch it.

460
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:11,980
Go down to the reception desk and ask.

461
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:14,210
Hurry up.'

462
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:17,090
So my last morning was to be taken away from
me.

463
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:19,340
I would not see Maxim.

464
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:21,400
Suddenly, I made up my mind.

465
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:25,770
Instead of going down to the reception desk,
I ran up the stairs.

466
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:27,390
I knew the number of his room.

467
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:29,570
I knocked on the door.

468
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:31,200
'Come in,' Maxim shouted.

469
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,500
I opened the door.

470
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,312
He was having breakfast at a small table in
his sitting-room.

471
00:23:35,312 --> 00:23:39,310
I stood by the door, feeling silly and awkward.

472
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:42,130
'What do you want?' he said.

473
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:44,039
'Is something wrong?'

474
00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:47,390
'I've come to say goodbye,' I said.

475
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:48,909
'We're going this morning.

476
00:23:48,909 --> 00:23:51,029
In about an hour.

477
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:54,210
I thought I would not see you again.'

478
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:55,360
Maxim stared at me.

479
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,820
'Why didn't you tell me about this before?'
he said.

480
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:01,340
'Mrs Van Hopper only decided to leave yesterday.

481
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:05,070
Her daughter sails for New York on Saturday
and we're going with her.

482
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:06,720
I don't want to go.

483
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,600
I'll hate New York.'

484
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,490
'Why go there, then?'

485
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:11,899
'I have to.

486
00:24:11,899 --> 00:24:14,010
I work for her, you know that.

487
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:16,110
I can't afford to leave her.'

488
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:18,200
'Sit down,' he said.

489
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,770
'Have some coffee.'

490
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:22,110
'I haven't time,' I told him.

491
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:24,260
'I should be downstairs now.'

492
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:28,750
'Never mind about that, I've got to talk to
you.'

493
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:30,480
I sat down at the table.

494
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,150
'So Mrs Van Hopper wants to go home,' said
Maxim.

495
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:39,330
'So do I. She goes to New York and I go to
Manderley.

496
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:40,549
Which do you prefer?

497
00:24:40,549 --> 00:24:42,419
You can take your choice.'

498
00:24:42,419 --> 00:24:44,090
'Please don't joke about it,' I said.

499
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:47,309
'I must say goodbye now.'

500
00:24:47,309 --> 00:24:49,159
'I'm not joking,' said Maxim.

501
00:24:49,159 --> 00:24:54,480
'Either you go to America with Mrs Van Hopper
or you come home to Manderley with me.'

502
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,570
'Do you want a secretary?'

503
00:24:56,570 --> 00:24:58,929
I asked, not understanding him.

504
00:24:58,929 --> 00:25:03,330
'No, I'm asking you to marry me, you little
fool.'

505
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:06,580
I sat with my hands in my lap, watching him
drink his coffee.

506
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:10,360
'You can't marry me,' I said at last.

507
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,580
'I'm different from you.

508
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:13,750
I don't belong to your kind of world.

509
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:16,040
I don't belong to a place like Manderley.'

510
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,940
'What do you know about Manderley?'

511
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:19,940
Maxim said.

512
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:21,510
'I want you to marry me.

513
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:23,940
Are you going to?'

514
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,860
I sat there, staring at him.

515
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:27,639
I could not think clearly.

516
00:25:27,639 --> 00:25:31,210
'The idea doesn't seem to please you,' Maxim
said.

517
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:34,559
'I'm sorry, I thought you loved me.'

518
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:37,950
'I do love you,' I said, 'I do.

519
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:39,419
I've been crying all night.

520
00:25:39,419 --> 00:25:41,000
I thought I would never see you again.'

521
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,760
When I said this, Maxim laughed and put his
hand over mine.

522
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,820
'One day I'll remind you of those words.

523
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:52,660
It's a pity you have to grow up,' he said.

524
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:54,230
Was Maxim laughing at me?

525
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:56,740
Was it all a joke?

526
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:58,279
He saw the look on my face.

527
00:25:58,279 --> 00:26:01,100
'I haven't done this very well, have I?'

528
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,100
Maxim said.

529
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:04,529
'Men don't usually propose at breakfast.

530
00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:06,399
But I'll take you to Venice for our honeymoon.

531
00:26:06,399 --> 00:26:08,850
We'll travel round Italy for a time.

532
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:12,149
Then, in the spring, we'll go back to Manderley.

533
00:26:12,149 --> 00:26:15,870
I want to show you Manderley so much.'

534
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:19,080
Maxim wanted to show me Manderley.

535
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,940
Suddenly I believed everything.

536
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:23,390
I would be Maxim's wife.

537
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:25,820
We would walk in the gardens of Manderley
together.

538
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:28,850
We would walk through that hidden valley to
the sea.

539
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:33,909
Mrs de Winter - I would be Mrs de Winter.

540
00:26:33,909 --> 00:26:39,500
'Am I going to tell Mrs Van Hopper or are
you?' said Maxim with a smile.

541
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:42,470
I had forgotten all about Mrs Van Hopper.

542
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:44,630
'You tell her,' I said.

543
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:45,730
'She'll be so angry.'

544
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:50,429
We got up from the table and walked out of
the room together.

545
00:26:50,429 --> 00:26:52,000
Maxim took my hand.

546
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,669
'I'm forty-two,' he said.

547
00:26:54,669 --> 00:26:57,110
'That must seem very old to you.'

548
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:59,220
'Oh, no,' I said.

549
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,150
'I don't like young men.'

550
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:04,380
I was still afraid that Maxim would change
his mind.

551
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:07,139
We came to the door of Mrs Van Hopper's rooms.

552
00:27:07,139 --> 00:27:10,330
'I think I'll talk to her alone,' Maxim said.

553
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:13,029
'I'll tell her we are getting married very
soon.

554
00:27:13,029 --> 00:27:14,700
We'll have a quiet wedding.

555
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,720
Everything can be arranged in a few days.'

556
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,799
'Of course,' I said.

557
00:27:17,799 --> 00:27:19,679
'I don't want a lot of fuss.'

558
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,180
I opened the door.

559
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,950
'Is that you?'

560
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:25,340
called Mrs Van Hopper.

561
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:26,340
'Where have you been?

562
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:29,440
What have you been doing all this time?'

563
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,650
I did not know whether to laugh or cry.

564
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,470
Maxim walked towards the sitting-room.

565
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:38,679
'I'm afraid it's all my fault,' he said and
then he shut the door.

566
00:27:38,679 --> 00:27:42,450
I went into my bedroom and waited.

567
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:45,470
I wondered what Maxim was saying to Mrs Van
Hopper.

568
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:47,640
Was he saying, 'I love her.

569
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:51,029
I want to marry her at once.'?

570
00:27:51,029 --> 00:27:52,029
Love.

571
00:27:52,029 --> 00:27:54,179
Maxim had not said anything to me about love.

572
00:27:54,179 --> 00:27:56,610
He had said we would get married.

573
00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:59,620
But he had not said that he loved me.

574
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:01,539
He had loved Rebecca, of course.

575
00:28:01,539 --> 00:28:04,130
How could he love me, after her?

576
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:06,799
I would be a companion for him.

577
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:08,830
Someone to make him laugh perhaps.

578
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:12,080
The book of poems was beside me, on the bed.

579
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,080
I opened it.

580
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:17,730
I read again, 'Max, from Rebecca.'

581
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:19,559
She was dead.

582
00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:21,831
But the writing still looked fresh and alive.

583
00:28:21,831 --> 00:28:26,690
I took some scissors and cut the page out
of the book.

584
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:27,960
I tore up the page.

585
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,789
I lit a match and set fire to the pieces.

586
00:28:30,789 --> 00:28:35,399
The paper twisted, blackened and turned to
ashes.

587
00:28:35,399 --> 00:28:37,519
The letter "R" was the last to be burnt.

588
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:39,820
Then the flame destroyed it.

589
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:41,580
I washed my hands.

590
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:44,260
I felt better, much better now.

591
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:48,590
As I stood there, the door opened and Maxim
came in.

592
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:51,139
'Everything is all right,' he said.

593
00:28:51,139 --> 00:28:53,000
'She could not speak at first.

594
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
She was too surprised.

595
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,210
Go in and talk to her.

596
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:58,779
I'm going downstairs to arrange about her
train.

597
00:28:58,779 --> 00:29:01,919
I don't want her to come to the wedding.'

598
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:05,539
Maxim was smiling, but he said nothing about
being happy.

599
00:29:05,539 --> 00:29:07,710
He said nothing about love.

600
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:10,639
I walked slowly into Mrs Van Hopper's bedroom.

601
00:29:10,639 --> 00:29:13,590
She was standing by the window, smoking a
cigarette.

602
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:16,120
She turned round and looked at me carefully.

603
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:21,809
'Well,' she said, 'you are more clever than
I thought.

604
00:29:21,809 --> 00:29:23,299
How did you do it?'

605
00:29:23,299 --> 00:29:25,800
I did not know what to say.

606
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:30,149
Mrs Van Hopper was smiling, but there was
no kindness in her smile.

607
00:29:30,149 --> 00:29:33,649
'It was lucky for you that I was ill,' she
said.

608
00:29:33,649 --> 00:29:36,029
'You certainly made the most of your time.

609
00:29:36,029 --> 00:29:39,130
He tells me that he wants to marry you in
a few days.

610
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:41,030
Well, I can't stop you.

611
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:44,250
He's much older than you, you know.'

612
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:46,571
'He's only forty-two,' I said.

613
00:29:46,571 --> 00:29:48,090
'I know what I'm doing.'

614
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:51,870
Mrs Van Hopper looked at me again with the
same unpleasant smile.

615
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:53,740
'I hope you do.

616
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:57,080
You won't find it easy to look after Manderley.

617
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:00,370
You haven't any experience and you're too
shy.

618
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:03,059
Max de Winter is very attractive, of course.

619
00:30:03,059 --> 00:30:05,920
But I think you're making a big mistake.'

620
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,630
I did not say anything.

621
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:09,970
I was young and shy, I knew that.

622
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:11,649
But I was going to be Mrs de Winter.

623
00:30:11,649 --> 00:30:13,970
I was going to live at Manderley.

624
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:15,799
And I was going to make Maxim happy.

625
00:30:15,799 --> 00:30:19,309
Mrs Van Hopper put out her cigarette.

626
00:30:19,309 --> 00:30:21,130
She walked slowly towards me.

627
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:25,610
'Of course,' she said, 'you know why he is
marrying you, don't you?

628
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:26,821
He's not in love with you.

629
00:30:26,821 --> 00:30:31,080
The truth is he's lonely by himself at Manderley.

630
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,710
He can't live in that empty house without
Rebecca.

631
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:37,630
He's marrying you because he can't go on living
there alone.'

632
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:54,610
CHAPTER FIVE
I Come to Manderley

633
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:58,630
Wе саmе to Manderley early in May.

634
00:30:58,630 --> 00:31:01,190
It was the best time of year, before the heat
of summer.

635
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:04,120
When we left London, it was raining hard.

636
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:08,110
I remember Maxim saying, 'This is London rain.

637
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:10,809
The sun will be shining for you when we come
to Manderley.'

638
00:31:10,809 --> 00:31:12,100
He was right.

639
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:16,590
Long before we reached Manderley, there was
blue sky over our heads.

640
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:18,419
I was glad to see the sun.

641
00:31:18,419 --> 00:31:20,929
I welcomed it as a sign of happiness.

642
00:31:20,929 --> 00:31:24,520
'Feeling better?' said Maxim, looking at me.

643
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,539
I smiled at him and took his hand.

644
00:31:26,539 --> 00:31:29,000
It was so easy for Maxim.

645
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,320
He was going back to his own home.

646
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:34,759
But for me, everything was new and strange.

647
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:37,370
I was going to Manderley for the first time.

648
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:41,090
And I was going there as the second wife of
Maxim de Winter.

649
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:45,000
'Only two more miles,' said Maxim at last.

650
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,230
'Can you see those trees on the hill in front
of us?

651
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:51,470
Manderley is in the valley beyond those trees.'

652
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:55,130
I tried to smile but suddenly I felt lonely
and afraid.

653
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:58,240
I was like a child on her first day at school.

654
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:03,019
Turning a corner, we came to a crossroads
and the beginning of a high wall.

655
00:32:03,019 --> 00:32:05,259
'Here we are,' Maxim said.

656
00:32:05,259 --> 00:32:06,970
'Manderley at last.'

657
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:10,240
I could hear the excitement in his voice.

658
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,759
The road turned again.

659
00:32:12,759 --> 00:32:16,500
On the left, were two high iron gates and
beside them a small lodge.

660
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:19,659
The gates were wide open for us.

661
00:32:19,659 --> 00:32:22,190
People were looking out of the windows of
the lodge.

662
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,470
They were looking at me.

663
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:25,980
I sat back in my seat.

664
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:29,559
I wanted to hide from their curious eyes.

665
00:32:29,559 --> 00:32:32,509
'You mustn't mind if people stare at you,'
Maxim said.

666
00:32:32,509 --> 00:32:34,940
'They are all very interested in you.

667
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:36,129
Don't worry.

668
00:32:36,129 --> 00:32:40,160
Be yourself and everyone at Manderley will
love you.

669
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,440
Mrs Danvers looks after the house.

670
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,429
She's been housekeeper here for years.

671
00:32:44,429 --> 00:32:46,429
Leave everything to her.

672
00:32:46,429 --> 00:32:49,740
She may be rather strange at first, but don't
worry about that.

673
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:52,759
She will soon get used to you.'

674
00:32:52,759 --> 00:32:56,180
We were going along the drive now that led
up to the house.

675
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:58,889
The drive turned and twisted like a snake.

676
00:32:58,889 --> 00:33:00,980
The tall trees met over our heads.

677
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:05,460
Only a little sunlight came through their
thick branches.

678
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:07,649
Everything was very quiet.

679
00:33:07,649 --> 00:33:09,870
On and on we went.

680
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:12,250
Then suddenly the trees came to an end.

681
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:14,039
The sun shone again.

682
00:33:14,039 --> 00:33:20,590
Beautiful high bushes covered with bright
red flowers stood on either side of us.

683
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:22,559
We were not far from the house now.

684
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:23,700
The drive widened.

685
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:28,809
We turned the last corner and there was Manderley.

686
00:33:28,809 --> 00:33:30,389
The old house was perfect.

687
00:33:30,389 --> 00:33:35,730
It was built in a small hollow and its grey
stones glowed in the sunlight.

688
00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:38,770
Smooth green lawns surrounded the house.

689
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:44,259
Beyond the lawns were gardens and beyond the
gardens, the sea.

690
00:33:44,259 --> 00:33:48,090
Maxim drove up to the wide stone steps and
stopped the car in front of them.

691
00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:50,980
At the top of the steps, a big door stood
wide open.

692
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:53,940
I saw that the hall beyond was full of people.

693
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:56,980
I could see their faces, all turned towards
us.

694
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:59,409
I was suddenly shy and afraid again.

695
00:33:59,409 --> 00:34:01,309
'What's the matter?'

696
00:34:01,309 --> 00:34:02,309
I said.

697
00:34:02,309 --> 00:34:04,620
'Who are all those people?'

698
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:06,220
'I'm sorry,' Maxim said.

699
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:08,970
'This must be Mrs Danvers' idea.

700
00:34:08,970 --> 00:34:10,950
Everyone who works at Manderley is here.

701
00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:12,860
Don't look so frightened.

702
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:14,580
You won't have to say anything.

703
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:16,360
I'll do it all.'

704
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,850
An old man with a kind face came down the
steps.

705
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:22,270
'Well, here we are, Frith,' said Maxim.

706
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:23,300
'Everyone well?'

707
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:26,390
'Yes, thank you, sir,' said Frith.

708
00:34:26,390 --> 00:34:30,060
'We are all very glad to see you at home again.

709
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:31,710
We hope you are well.

710
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:33,700
And Madam too, of course.'

711
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:36,580
'Yes, we are both well, thank you, Frith.

712
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:39,950
But we're tired from the drive and we want
our tea.

713
00:34:39,950 --> 00:34:42,200
I didn't expect all these people.'

714
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:45,760
'Mrs Danvers' orders, sir,' said Frith.

715
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,620
'I thought so,' Maxim said.

716
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:50,650
'Come on,' he said to me.

717
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:53,870
'It won't take long and then you can have
your tea in peace.'

718
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:58,020
We went together up the wide stone steps.

719
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:01,080
Inside the open door, the servants stood in
two lines.

720
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:04,780
A tall, thin woman dressed in black came towards
us.

721
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:07,810
Her pale, thin face was hard.

722
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:10,370
There was no welcome in her dark eyes.

723
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:14,360
The hand she placed in mine was cold and heavy,
like something dead.

724
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:18,720
'This is Mrs Danvers, our housekeeper,' said
Maxim.

725
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:22,200
The woman began to speak in a cold, lifeless
voice.

726
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:25,150
I remember nothing of what she said.

727
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:27,790
I suppose she was welcoming me to Manderley.

728
00:35:27,790 --> 00:35:32,830
As I thanked her, Mrs Danvers looked at me
with her hard, dark eyes.

729
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:37,591
I dropped my gloves on the floor and Mrs Danvers
picked them up with a twisted little smile

730
00:35:37,591 --> 00:35:39,080
on her lips.

731
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:45,850
She could see that I was awkward and shy,
and a little afraid of my new life at Manderley.

732
00:35:45,850 --> 00:35:46,890
Maxim noticed nothing.

733
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:50,520
He thanked Mrs Danvers quickly and took me
into the library for tea.

734
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:53,020
We were alone at last.

735
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:56,430
A dog ran up from the fireside to greet us.

736
00:35:56,430 --> 00:36:01,010
He went first to Maxim and then sat down beside
me.

737
00:36:01,010 --> 00:36:02,540
I was glad of the dog's friendly welcome.

738
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:05,800
The library was a large comfortable room.

739
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:09,880
Its walls were covered with books from the
floor to the ceiling.

740
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:13,590
Comfortable chairs stood on either side of
a great open fireplace.

741
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:18,430
From its long windows I could see the lawns
and beyond the lawns, the sea.

742
00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:19,940
There was a quiet peace in the room.

743
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:24,580
It was a place for rest, for reading and for
quiet thinking.

744
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:27,950
Tea was brought to us by Frith and a younger
servant.

745
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:31,690
There was a special table and a snow-white
cloth to cover it.

746
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:36,790
The teapot and kettle were of silver and the
china was very fine.

747
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:39,920
There were sandwiches, bread and butter and
several kinds of cake.

748
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:42,120
There was far too much food for two people.

749
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:46,650
But this was the tea served at Manderley every
day.

750
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:50,390
Maxim sat in a chair by the fire reading the
letters that had been waiting for him.

751
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:53,350
Now and again, he looked up at me and smiled.

752
00:36:53,350 --> 00:36:58,260
I leant back in my chair, drinking my tea
and trying to feel at home.

753
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:00,170
It was true.

754
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:04,920
Manderley was my home now - my home and Maxim's.

755
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,640
But somehow I still could not believe it.

756
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:12,030
My thoughts were interrupted by the opening
of the door.

757
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:13,480
It was Frith.

758
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,890
'Excuse me, Madam,' he said.

759
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:19,440
'Mrs Danvers asked if you would like to see
your room.'

760
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,440
Maxim looked up from his letters.

761
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:24,710
'What do the rooms in the east wing look like
now?' he said.

762
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:27,780
'Very nice indeed, sir,' Frith replied.

763
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:30,490
'I think you will be very comfortable there.'

764
00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:32,490
'Have you been making changes?'

765
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:33,490
I asked.

766
00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:35,590
'Oh, nothing much,' said Maxim.

767
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:38,850
'They have been getting the rooms in the east
wing ready for us.

768
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:42,110
There is a lovely view of the rose-garden
from there.

769
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:44,230
You go and make friends with Mrs Danvers.

770
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:45,230
I'll come up later.'

771
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:49,110
I got up slowly and went out with Frith into
the hall.

772
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:52,420
I did not want to be alone with Mrs Danvers.

773
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:58,100
The hall seemed very big, and my footsteps
sounded very loud on the stone floor.

774
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:01,540
Mrs Danvers was standing at the top of the
wide flight of stairs.

775
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:05,280
Her dark eyes watched me as I walked slowly
up the stairs towards her.

776
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,810
'I hope I haven't kept you waiting,' I said.

777
00:38:08,810 --> 00:38:13,780
'It is my duty to wait for you, Madam,' Mrs
Danvers said.

778
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:17,620
'I'm here to carry out your orders.'

779
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:19,040
She led me along a wide passage.

780
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:22,610
We passed through doors and up and down wide
stairs.

781
00:38:22,610 --> 00:38:26,500
At last Mrs Danvers opened a door leading
into a small room.

782
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:30,660
This room led into a large, light bedroom
with wide windows.

783
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:32,640
I went at once to a window and looked out.

784
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:35,030
The rose-garden lay below me.

785
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:38,410
Beyond the rose-garden, the smooth grass stretched
to the woods.

786
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:43,230
'You can't see the sea from here,' I said,
turning to Mrs Danvers.

787
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:48,710
'No, not from this wing,' she answered, 'and
you can't hear it either.

788
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:50,920
You would never know the sea was so near.'

789
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:56,300
Mrs Danvers spoke in a strange way, as though
this was somehow important to her.

790
00:38:56,300 --> 00:39:00,610
'I'm sorry about that; I like the sea,' I
said.

791
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:03,490
'But this is a very charming room.

792
00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:05,490
I'm sure I shall be comfortable here.'

793
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:10,540
'Mr de Winter gave very careful orders in
his letter about this room.

794
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:13,760
The rooms here have been specially arranged
for you.'

795
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,980
'Then this was not his bedroom before?'

796
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:17,490
'Oh, no, Madam.

797
00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:20,830
He has never used this room.'

798
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:22,310
There was silence.

799
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:23,860
I did not know what to say.

800
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:26,800
I wished Mrs Danvers would go away.

801
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:31,830
'I suppose you have been at Manderley for
many years,' I said.

802
00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:33,370
'Yes, Madam.

803
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:36,150
I came here when the first Mrs de Winter was
a bride.'

804
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:37,940
Her voice was suddenly harsh.

805
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:40,280
There was some colour in her pale face now.

806
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:43,510
And for a moment I saw a look of hatred in
her eyes.

807
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:48,790
'Mrs Danvers,' I heard myself saying, 'I hope
we shall be friends.

808
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:51,460
This sort of life is new to me.

809
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:53,410
I do want to make Mr de Winter happy.

810
00:39:53,410 --> 00:39:56,620
I know I can leave the housekeeping to you.

811
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:58,390
I shan't want to make any changes.'

812
00:39:58,390 --> 00:40:00,940
'Very well,' she said.

813
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:03,660
'I hope you will be satisfied.

814
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:06,380
I have been looking after the house for the
past year.

815
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:12,040
When the late Mrs de Winter was alive, there
were lots of parties and visitors, of course.

816
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,680
She liked to look after everything herself.'

817
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:18,450
'I would rather leave it to you, Mrs Danvers,'
I said.

818
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:21,060
'And I'm sure we'll be very comfortable in
these rooms.'

819
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:25,610
'Mr de Winter said you would rather be on
this side of the house.

820
00:40:25,610 --> 00:40:29,270
They used the rooms in the west wing when
Mrs de Winter was alive.

821
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:32,390
The windows there look down to the sea.'

822
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:37,030
There was a sound outside the door and Mrs
Danvers stopped talking.

823
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:38,370
Maxim came into the room.

824
00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:40,690
'Well, what do you think?'

825
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:41,690
Maxim said to me.

826
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:43,230
'I hope you like the rooms.

827
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:45,730
I think you've done very well, Mrs Danvers.'

828
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:48,380
'Thank you, sir,' she said.

829
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:51,120
Then she turned and went quietly out of the
room.

830
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:53,500
Maxim walked to the window.

831
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:56,670
'I love the rose-garden,' he said.

832
00:40:56,670 --> 00:40:59,740
'There's something very quiet and peaceful
about this room.

833
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:02,870
How did you get on with Mrs Danvers?

834
00:41:02,870 --> 00:41:04,950
She's a strange woman in many ways.

835
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:08,260
I think that some of the young servants are
afraid of her.'

836
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:12,480
'I expect we'll get on well when she knows
me better,' I said.

837
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:15,700
'She may not like me at first, of course.'

838
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:16,920
'Not like you?

839
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:22,820
Why shouldn't she like you?' said Maxim and
he came across the room and kissed me gently.

840
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:24,960
'Let's forget about Mrs Danvers,' he said.

841
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:28,240
'Come along, and I'll show you Manderley.'

842
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:32,020
I felt happier as I walked through the house
with Maxim.

843
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:37,290
We looked at the pictures in the long gallery
and at most of the rooms downstairs.

844
00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:38,770
Maxim put his arm round my shoulder.

845
00:41:38,770 --> 00:41:42,890
I began to feel that Manderley really was
my home.

846
00:41:42,890 --> 00:41:46,030
After dinner, we sat in the library.

847
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:48,540
The curtains were drawn and more logs put
on the fire.

848
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:51,162
It was new for us to sit together quietly
like this.

849
00:41:51,162 --> 00:41:56,850
In Italy we had walked about in the evenings,
or gone for a drive.

850
00:41:56,850 --> 00:41:58,550
Maxim sat in the chair to the left of the
fireplace.

851
00:41:58,550 --> 00:41:59,550
He picked up the paper.

852
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:04,900
He put a cushion behind his head and lit a
cigarette.

853
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:06,840
This is what he always did, I thought.

854
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:09,160
This is what he did before he knew me.

855
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:13,520
It is what he has done every evening for years.

856
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:14,840
Maxim did not look at me.

857
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:17,140
He went on reading his paper.

858
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:20,030
He was comfortable, the master of his house.

859
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:22,640
I poured myself another cup of coffee.

860
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:27,380
I bent down to the dog and stroked its soft
ears.

861
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:30,790
Suddenly I shivered as though a door had opened
behind me.

862
00:42:30,790 --> 00:42:34,250
Someone else had sat in my chair.

863
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:37,360
Someone else had poured coffee and stroked
the dog.

864
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:39,510
I was sitting in Rebecca's chair.

865
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:43,200
I was leaning against Rebecca's cushion.

866
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:51,210
The dog, Jasper, came to me because in the
past he had come to Rebecca.

867
00:42:51,210 --> 00:43:01,370
CHAPTER SIX
In the Morning-Room

868
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:03,480
Life at Manderley was very carefully planned.

869
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:06,590
The same things happened at the same time
every day.

870
00:43:06,590 --> 00:43:09,910
I remember our first morning there very clearly.

871
00:43:09,910 --> 00:43:13,200
I had slept well and came downstairs a little
after nine o'clock.

872
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:19,130
To my surprise, I found that Maxim had nearly
finished his breakfast.

873
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:20,950
Maxim looked up at me and smiled.

874
00:43:20,950 --> 00:43:23,530
'I always get up early here,' he said.

875
00:43:23,530 --> 00:43:26,420
'Looking after Manderley takes a lot of my
time.

876
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:27,790
I work very hard.

877
00:43:27,790 --> 00:43:29,200
But you don't have to.

878
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:32,240
Help yourself to anything you want.'

879
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:34,590
I remember the size of that breakfast.

880
00:43:34,590 --> 00:43:37,790
It was the normal Manderley breakfast, but
far too much for two people.

881
00:43:37,790 --> 00:43:42,920
As I took an egg and some coffee, I wondered
what happened to the food that was left.

882
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:46,000
Would it be eaten or thrown away?

883
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,730
I would never know of course.

884
00:43:47,730 --> 00:43:49,640
I would certainly be too afraid to ask.

885
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:54,830
'My sister, Beatrice, is coming over to lunch
with her husband,' Maxim told me.

886
00:43:54,830 --> 00:43:56,930
'She invited herself, of course.

887
00:43:56,930 --> 00:43:59,580
I suppose she wants to have a look at you.'

888
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:01,180
They're coming today?'

889
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:03,840
I said, feeling less happy than before.

890
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:06,420
'Yes, but she won't stay long.

891
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:07,610
I think you'll like Beatrice.

892
00:44:07,610 --> 00:44:10,090
She believes in telling the truth.

893
00:44:10,090 --> 00:44:12,780
If she doesn't like you, she'll tell you so.'

894
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:14,860
Maxim stood up and lit a cigarette.

895
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:17,580
'I've so many things to do this morning.

896
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:19,210
Why don't you go into the garden.

897
00:44:19,210 --> 00:44:21,940
You don't mind being alone, do you?'

898
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:24,010
'Of course not,' I said.

899
00:44:24,010 --> 00:44:26,410
'I shall be perfectly happy.'

900
00:44:26,410 --> 00:44:29,750
But I did not feel very happy as Maxim walked
out of the room.

901
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:33,110
I had thought we would spend our first morning
at Manderley together.

902
00:44:33,110 --> 00:44:38,200
I had thought that perhaps we would walk down
to the sea, or sit under the great tree on

903
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:39,300
the lawn.

904
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:41,500
I finished my breakfast alone.

905
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:45,010
I left the dining-room and went into the library.

906
00:44:45,010 --> 00:44:46,570
The room was cold.

907
00:44:46,570 --> 00:44:48,770
The fire was laid, but not lit.

908
00:44:48,770 --> 00:44:51,770
I looked round for a box of matches, but I
could not find one.

909
00:44:51,770 --> 00:44:55,240
I went across the hall and into the dining-room
once more.

910
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:57,720
Yes, there was a box of matches on the table.

911
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:59,430
I picked it up.

912
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:02,120
At that moment, Frith came into the room.

913
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:06,990
'Oh, Frith,' I said awkwardly, 'I could not
find any matches.

914
00:45:06,990 --> 00:45:09,380
I thought I would light the fire in the library.

915
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:11,650
It's rather cold in there.'

916
00:45:11,650 --> 00:45:17,370
'The fire in the library is not usually lit
until the afternoon, Madam,' he said.

917
00:45:17,370 --> 00:45:20,870
'Mrs de Winter always used the morning-room
before lunch.

918
00:45:20,870 --> 00:45:23,150
There is a good fire in there.

919
00:45:23,150 --> 00:45:27,120
Of course, I can give orders for the fire
in the library to be lit.'

920
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:29,200
'Oh no,' I said.

921
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,580
'I'll go into the morning-room.

922
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:33,630
Thank you, Frith.'

923
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:38,450
'Mrs de Winter always wrote her letters in
the morning-room after breakfast.

924
00:45:38,450 --> 00:45:42,580
The house telephone is there too, if you want
to talk to Mrs Danvers.'

925
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:45,890
'Thank you, Frith,' I said.

926
00:45:45,890 --> 00:45:49,790
I went into the hall again, I did not know
which way to go.

927
00:45:49,790 --> 00:45:53,460
I could not tell Frith that I had never seen
the morning-room.

928
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:55,410
Maxim had not shown it to me the night before.

929
00:45:55,410 --> 00:46:01,410
'You go through the drawing-room to the morning-room,
Madam,' Frith said, watching me.

930
00:46:01,410 --> 00:46:03,000
'Then turn to your left.'

931
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,430
'Thank you, Frith,' I said.

932
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:09,090
I felt very stupid.

933
00:46:09,090 --> 00:46:11,820
I found my way into the little morning-room.

934
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:16,450
I was glad to see the dog, Jasper, there,
sitting in front of the fire.

935
00:46:16,450 --> 00:46:19,770
The morning-room was quite small and very
different from the library.

936
00:46:19,770 --> 00:46:23,450
It was a woman's room, graceful and charming.

937
00:46:23,450 --> 00:46:27,060
Someone had chosen everything in this room
with the greatest care.

938
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:33,920
Each chair, each rug, each small ornament
had been put there to make the room perfect.

939
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:37,230
Flowers filled the room, glowing blood-red
flowers.

940
00:46:37,230 --> 00:46:40,800
They were the same flowers we had seen in
the drive.

941
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:44,600
A beautiful old writing-desk stood near the
window.

942
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:47,710
I went over and opened the desk carefully.

943
00:46:47,710 --> 00:46:51,420
Every drawer was labelled and everything was
in order.

944
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:55,570
Inside one of the drawers was a flat leather
book: 'Guests at Manderley'.

945
00:46:55,570 --> 00:46:58,150
I opened the book.

946
00:46:58,150 --> 00:47:02,220
The writing inside the book and the writing
on the labels was the same.

947
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:04,820
I had seen that tall sloping writing before.

948
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:07,290
It was Rebecca's writing.

949
00:47:07,290 --> 00:47:09,440
This was Rebecca's desk.

950
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:12,170
I sat down and opened the Guest Book.

951
00:47:12,170 --> 00:47:14,240
Every page was covered with the same writing.

952
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:19,350
I felt that Rebecca would come back into the
room at any moment.

953
00:47:19,350 --> 00:47:23,970
The mistress of the house would come in and
find me, a stranger, sitting at her desk.

954
00:47:23,970 --> 00:47:25,780
Suddenly the telephone on the desk began to
ring.

955
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:27,000
My heart jumped.

956
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,520
I picked up the phone.

957
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:29,520
'Who is it?'

958
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:30,520
I said.

959
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:32,810
'Who do you want?'

960
00:47:32,810 --> 00:47:38,930
'Mrs de Winter?' said a hard, deep voice,
'Mrs de Winter?'

961
00:47:38,930 --> 00:47:40,220
My hand was shaking.

962
00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:42,940
'I'm afraid you have made a mistake,' I said.

963
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:46,640
'Mrs de Winter has been dead for over a year.'

964
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:49,700
I suddenly realized what I had said.

965
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:53,050
'It's Mrs Danvers, Madam,' said the voice.

966
00:47:53,050 --> 00:47:55,830
'I'm speaking to you on the house telephone.'

967
00:47:55,830 --> 00:48:00,080
'I'm so sorry, Mrs Danvers,' I said.

968
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:01,560
'I didn't know what I was saying.

969
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:04,500
I did not expect the telephone to ring.'

970
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:08,000
'I wondered if you had seen the menus for
the day.

971
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,960
You will find the list on the desk beside
you.'

972
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:13,900
I found the piece of paper and looked at it
quickly.

973
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:15,930
'Yes, Mrs Danvers.

974
00:48:15,930 --> 00:48:17,860
Yes, very nice indeed.'

975
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:21,300
'I'm very sorry to have disturbed you, Madam.'

976
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:23,850
'You didn't disturb me at all.

977
00:48:23,850 --> 00:48:26,330
Thank you, Mrs Danvers,' I said.

978
00:48:26,330 --> 00:48:29,830
I put down the phone and looked at the desk.

979
00:48:29,830 --> 00:48:31,150
I felt very stupid.

980
00:48:31,150 --> 00:48:34,650
Rebecca would not have answered like that.

981
00:48:34,650 --> 00:48:37,160
I thought of Rebecca sitting at that desk.

982
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:40,960
Here she had chosen her guests and written
letters to her friends.

983
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:42,810
Who could I write to?

984
00:48:42,810 --> 00:48:44,640
I knew nobody.

985
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:47,870
Then I thought of Mrs Van Hopper, far away
in New York.

986
00:48:47,870 --> 00:48:51,200
I took a piece of paper and a pen.

987
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:54,180
'Dear Mrs Van Hopper,' I began.

988
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:58,320
As I wrote I noticed my own handwriting for
the first time.

989
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:00,460
How weak and childish it was!

990
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:12,890
It was like the writing of a schoolgirl.

991
00:49:12,890 --> 00:49:15,960
CHAPTER SEVEN
You Are So Very Different...

992
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:22,170
When I heard the sound of a car in the drive,
I stood up in sudden fear.

993
00:49:22,170 --> 00:49:24,550
Beatrice and her husband had arrived.

994
00:49:24,550 --> 00:49:26,720
They were earlier than I expected.

995
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:28,200
And Maxim had not come back.

996
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:31,670
I could not meet them by myself.

997
00:49:31,670 --> 00:49:33,340
I ran quickly out of the morning-room.

998
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:35,740
I took a door to the left.

999
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:37,580
I was in a stone corridor.

1000
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:40,370
A servant stared at me in surprise.

1001
00:49:40,370 --> 00:49:45,160
I hurried up some stairs, hoping that I could
find my way to my bedroom in the east wing.

1002
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:48,580
I could stay there until Maxim came back.

1003
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:49,790
Somehow I lost my way.

1004
00:49:49,790 --> 00:49:53,510
But I went on and came to a wide staircase.

1005
00:49:53,510 --> 00:49:55,090
I went up it.

1006
00:49:55,090 --> 00:49:56,460
All was quiet and dark.

1007
00:49:56,460 --> 00:50:00,490
I was in a corridor with doors on either side.

1008
00:50:00,490 --> 00:50:03,530
I walked on and at last I came to a long window.

1009
00:50:03,530 --> 00:50:04,940
I looked out.

1010
00:50:04,940 --> 00:50:08,020
Below me I could see green lawns and the sea.

1011
00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:12,280
The sea was bright green, with white-topped
waves.

1012
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:15,820
It was closer than I thought, much closer.

1013
00:50:15,820 --> 00:50:18,390
I knew then that I had walked right round
the house.

1014
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:21,690
I was standing in the corridor of the west
wing.

1015
00:50:21,690 --> 00:50:27,760
Yes, Mrs Danvers was right, you could hear
the sea from here.

1016
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:30,320
I was glad that my rooms were in the east
wing.

1017
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:33,310
I loved the quiet beauty of the rose-garden.

1018
00:50:33,310 --> 00:50:35,160
The sea was too near here.

1019
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:39,970
As I turned to go back to the stairs, I heard
a door open behind me.

1020
00:50:39,970 --> 00:50:42,450
Mrs Danvers stood there.

1021
00:50:42,450 --> 00:50:45,180
We stared at one another for a moment without
speaking.

1022
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:50,700
'I lost my way,' I said, 'I was trying to
find my room.'

1023
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:53,320
'This is the west wing,' she said.

1024
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:55,660
'Did you go into any of the rooms?

1025
00:50:55,660 --> 00:50:58,670
If you wish to see them, please tell me.

1026
00:50:58,670 --> 00:51:00,550
I could show them to you now.'

1027
00:51:00,550 --> 00:51:02,250
I shook my head.

1028
00:51:02,250 --> 00:51:05,250
'No, no thank you,' I said.

1029
00:51:05,250 --> 00:51:06,610
'I must go downstairs.'

1030
00:51:06,610 --> 00:51:10,420
As I began to walk towards the stairs, Mrs
Danvers followed me.

1031
00:51:10,420 --> 00:51:16,300
'If you want to see the rooms in the west
wing, I can show them to you at any time.'

1032
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:19,740
'It's very kind of you, Mrs Danvers,' I said.

1033
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:21,350
'I will let you know.'

1034
00:51:21,350 --> 00:51:23,800
Mrs Danvers walked beside me.

1035
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:28,160
'Major and Mrs Lacy have been here some time,'
she said.

1036
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:29,180
'Didn't you hear their car?

1037
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:31,700
Frith took them to the morning-room.

1038
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:34,710
I think you know your way now, don't you?'

1039
00:51:34,710 --> 00:51:37,550
'Yes, Mrs Danvers,' I said.

1040
00:51:37,550 --> 00:51:40,930
I knew then that she had been watching me,
laughing at my fear.

1041
00:51:40,930 --> 00:51:44,040
As I went into the drawing-room, I looked
back.

1042
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:48,170
Mrs Danvers was still watching me from the
top of the stairs.

1043
00:51:48,170 --> 00:51:51,620
I could hear the sound of voices from the
morning-room.

1044
00:51:51,620 --> 00:51:55,680
I stood for a moment and then walked in.

1045
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:58,070
'Here she is at last,' Maxim said.

1046
00:51:58,070 --> 00:51:59,530
'Where have you been hiding?

1047
00:51:59,530 --> 00:52:02,770
Here is Beatrice and this is Giles.

1048
00:52:02,770 --> 00:52:05,560
And this is Frank Crawley, our agent.'

1049
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:10,380
Beatrice was tall, broad-shouldered and very
much like Maxim.

1050
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:15,820
She shook hands with me and said to Maxim,
'She's quite different from what I expected.

1051
00:52:15,820 --> 00:52:18,230
Not like your description at all.'

1052
00:52:18,230 --> 00:52:20,680
Everyone laughed, but they seemed friendly.

1053
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:22,690
Giles was a big, heavy man.

1054
00:52:22,690 --> 00:52:26,890
His eyes smiled at me from behind his thick
glasses.

1055
00:52:26,890 --> 00:52:30,370
Frank Crawley was a thin man with a pleasant,
worried face.

1056
00:52:30,370 --> 00:52:34,570
Maxim had told me how hard Frank Crawley worked
for Manderley.

1057
00:52:34,570 --> 00:52:39,480
The men began to talk together and I had to
answer Beatrice's questions.

1058
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:41,230
'What do you think of Manderley?'

1059
00:52:41,230 --> 00:52:42,260
she asked me.

1060
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:45,100
'I haven't seen much of it yet,' I said.

1061
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:47,530
'The house is beautiful, of course.

1062
00:52:47,530 --> 00:52:51,770
I haven't seen the gardens, but I'm sure I
shall never get tired of them.

1063
00:52:51,770 --> 00:52:53,280
I love walking.

1064
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:55,920
I can swim too, when the weather is warmer.'

1065
00:52:55,920 --> 00:53:00,970
'My dear, the water is always far too cold
here,' said Beatrice.

1066
00:53:00,970 --> 00:53:03,850
'I don't mind that, I love swimming.

1067
00:53:03,850 --> 00:53:06,030
Is it safe to swim in the bays?'

1068
00:53:06,030 --> 00:53:08,430
Everyone stopped talking.

1069
00:53:08,430 --> 00:53:10,770
I realized what I had said.

1070
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:13,570
Rebecca had been drowned in the bay.

1071
00:53:13,570 --> 00:53:15,480
I could not look at Maxim.

1072
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:18,580
I bent down to stroke the dog's head.

1073
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:22,280
Then, thank God, Frith came in to say that
lunch was ready.

1074
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:24,510
Beatrice walked with me through the hall.

1075
00:53:24,510 --> 00:53:29,370
'You know,' she said, 'you are much younger
than I expected.

1076
00:53:29,370 --> 00:53:33,010
Tell me, do you love Maxim very much?'

1077
00:53:33,010 --> 00:53:35,710
Beatrice looked at my surprised face and laughed.

1078
00:53:35,710 --> 00:53:37,420
'Don't answer,' she said.

1079
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:39,750
'I can see that you do.

1080
00:53:39,750 --> 00:53:40,870
Maxim looks very well.

1081
00:53:40,870 --> 00:53:43,170
We were all very worried about him last year.

1082
00:53:43,170 --> 00:53:45,640
But of course, you know the whole story.'

1083
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:48,230
But Beatrice was wrong.

1084
00:53:48,230 --> 00:53:51,880
I did not know what had happened down in the
bay.

1085
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:53,180
Maxim had told me nothing.

1086
00:53:53,180 --> 00:53:57,120
I had never asked him about Rebecca's death.

1087
00:53:57,120 --> 00:53:59,360
Beatrice talked to Maxim all through lunch.

1088
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:01,330
Frank Crawley told me a lot about Manderley.

1089
00:54:01,330 --> 00:54:05,480
I could see that he loved it as much as Maxim
did.

1090
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:08,690
When lunch was over, I could see that Maxim
was tired.

1091
00:54:08,690 --> 00:54:11,210
I wished we hadn't had visitors so soon.

1092
00:54:11,210 --> 00:54:14,000
I took Beatrice out on to the terrace.

1093
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,070
She asked me how I had met Maxim.

1094
00:54:16,070 --> 00:54:19,620
I told her about Mrs Van Hopper and how surprised
she had been.

1095
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:23,600
'It was rather a shock to us too,' Beatrice
said.

1096
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:27,070
'Maxim said in his letter that you were very
young and pretty.

1097
00:54:27,070 --> 00:54:29,770
We expected a very modern sort of girl.'

1098
00:54:29,770 --> 00:54:32,320
Beatrice laughed and I laughed with her.

1099
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:33,990
'Poor Maxim.

1100
00:54:33,990 --> 00:54:36,670
He had a terrible time,' Beatrice said.

1101
00:54:36,670 --> 00:54:38,980
'Let's hope you have made him forget all about
it.

1102
00:54:38,980 --> 00:54:40,480
He loves Manderley so much.

1103
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:42,880
But you never know what he is thinking.

1104
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:45,910
How do you get on with Mrs Danvers?'

1105
00:54:45,910 --> 00:54:48,950
I was surprised by Beatrice's question.

1106
00:54:48,950 --> 00:54:52,260
'She frightens me a little,' I said.

1107
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:56,180
'She may try to make things unpleasant for
you,' Beatrice went on.

1108
00:54:56,180 --> 00:54:58,540
'She's very jealous, of course.

1109
00:54:58,540 --> 00:55:00,320
She must hate you being here.'

1110
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:01,320
'Why?'

1111
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:02,320
I asked.

1112
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:05,480
'Why must she hate me being at Manderley?'

1113
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:12,420
'My dear child,' Beatrice answered slowly,
'I thought Maxim had told you.

1114
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:14,910
Mrs Danvers adored Rebecca.

1115
00:55:14,910 --> 00:55:15,980
She still does.'

1116
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:19,630
At that moment, the men came out of the house.

1117
00:55:19,630 --> 00:55:24,530
A servant brought rugs and chairs and we all
sat under the great tree on the lawn.

1118
00:55:24,530 --> 00:55:26,360
I hoped everyone would go soon.

1119
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:28,820
I wanted to be alone with Maxim.

1120
00:55:28,820 --> 00:55:32,410
I was sitting on a rug, leaning against Maxim's
chair.

1121
00:55:32,410 --> 00:55:35,570
I listened to the others talking.

1122
00:55:35,570 --> 00:55:37,190
The afternoon was sleepy and peaceful.

1123
00:55:37,190 --> 00:55:39,900
Everything was quiet and still.

1124
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:42,280
Even the sea seemed far away.

1125
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:45,650
This is what I wanted, I thought.

1126
00:55:45,650 --> 00:55:48,530
This is how I thought life at Manderley would
be.

1127
00:55:48,530 --> 00:55:50,410
This moment was safe.

1128
00:55:50,410 --> 00:55:52,730
It could not be touched.

1129
00:55:52,730 --> 00:55:56,250
Here we sat together, Maxim and I, hand in
hand.

1130
00:55:56,250 --> 00:55:59,200
The past and the future did not matter at
all.

1131
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:02,220
At this moment I was not afraid.

1132
00:56:02,220 --> 00:56:04,170
The moment passed.

1133
00:56:04,170 --> 00:56:05,170
Beatrice stood up.

1134
00:56:05,170 --> 00:56:07,360
'We must be going,' she said.

1135
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:09,750
'We've got people coming to dinner.'

1136
00:56:09,750 --> 00:56:11,830
We all got up and Giles looked up at the sky.

1137
00:56:11,830 --> 00:56:15,600
'I'm afraid we're going to have some rain,'
he said.

1138
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:19,270
We all walked slowly back to the drive.

1139
00:56:19,270 --> 00:56:20,270
Beatrice took my hand.

1140
00:56:20,270 --> 00:56:22,550
Then she bent down and kissed me.

1141
00:56:22,550 --> 00:56:26,240
'Forgive me if I've asked you a lot of rude
questions, my dear.

1142
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:28,920
As I said before, you are not what we expected.

1143
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:31,740
You are so very different from Rebecca.'

1144
00:56:31,740 --> 00:56:38,200
As we reached the car, the sun went behind
a cloud and a little rain began to fall.

1145
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:42,010
Maxim and I watched the car drive away.

1146
00:56:42,010 --> 00:56:52,870
We turned and walked back into the house.

1147
00:56:52,870 --> 00:57:02,640
CHAPTER EIGHT
The Happy Valley

1148
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:08,510
As we stood in the hall, Maxim put his arm
round my shoulders.

1149
00:57:08,510 --> 00:57:10,290
'Thank God that's over,' he said.

1150
00:57:10,290 --> 00:57:14,020
'Get a coat quickly and let's go out.

1151
00:57:14,020 --> 00:57:17,510
Never mind the rain, I want a walk.'

1152
00:57:17,510 --> 00:57:19,240
Maxim looked white and ill.

1153
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:22,080
Had Beatrice said something to make him angry?

1154
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:23,560
I could not remember.

1155
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:25,970
'Just a moment,' I said.

1156
00:57:25,970 --> 00:57:27,960
'I'll get my coat from upstairs.'

1157
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:31,230
'There are plenty of raincoats downstairs,'
Maxim said.

1158
00:57:31,230 --> 00:57:34,380
'Robert, will you fetch a coat for Mrs de
Winter?'

1159
00:57:34,380 --> 00:57:38,760
Maxim was standing in the drive now, calling
to Jasper.

1160
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:40,400
'Come on, you lazy little fellow.

1161
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:42,170
You're too fat.'

1162
00:57:42,170 --> 00:57:45,560
Jasper ran round in circles, barking loudly.

1163
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:48,610
The young servant, Robert, ran out of the
hall, carrying a raincoat.

1164
00:57:48,610 --> 00:57:50,460
I put it on quickly.

1165
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:53,770
It was too big, of course, and too long.

1166
00:57:53,770 --> 00:57:57,450
But Maxim was waiting impatiently and there
was no time to change the coat.

1167
00:57:57,450 --> 00:58:00,490
We set off together across the lawns to the
woods.

1168
00:58:00,490 --> 00:58:02,540
Jasper ran on in front.

1169
00:58:02,540 --> 00:58:06,970
'I soon get tired of my family,' Maxim said.

1170
00:58:06,970 --> 00:58:10,560
'Beatrice is very kind-hearted, but she always
says the wrong thing.'

1171
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:14,930
I was not sure what Beatrice had said and
I thought it better not to ask.

1172
00:58:14,930 --> 00:58:17,450
'What did you think of Beatrice?'

1173
00:58:17,450 --> 00:58:18,810
Maxim asked me.

1174
00:58:18,810 --> 00:58:21,850
'What did she talk to you about after lunch?'

1175
00:58:21,850 --> 00:58:25,181
'I think I did most of the talking,' I said.

1176
00:58:25,181 --> 00:58:27,300
'I was telling her about how we met.

1177
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:29,530
She said I was quite different from what she
expected.'

1178
00:58:29,530 --> 00:58:32,780
'What on earth did she expect?'

1179
00:58:32,780 --> 00:58:35,650
'Someone much smarter, I think.

1180
00:58:35,650 --> 00:58:38,660
A modern young woman.'

1181
00:58:38,660 --> 00:58:39,660
Maxim did not answer.

1182
00:58:39,660 --> 00:58:43,760
He bent down and threw a stick for Jasper
to run after.

1183
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:47,870
We climbed the grass bank above the lawns
and walked down into the woods.

1184
00:58:47,870 --> 00:58:51,630
The trees grew very close together over our
heads and it was very dark.

1185
00:58:51,630 --> 00:58:54,490
We walked on last year's leaves.

1186
00:58:54,490 --> 00:58:57,010
The green shoots of flowers were beginning
to show through.

1187
00:58:57,010 --> 00:59:01,390
Jasper was silent now, with his nose to the
ground.

1188
00:59:01,390 --> 00:59:03,050
We came to a clearing in the woods.

1189
00:59:03,050 --> 00:59:06,210
There were two paths, going in opposite directions.

1190
00:59:06,210 --> 00:59:11,120
Jasper ran on ahead and took the right-hand
path without waiting for us.

1191
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:12,790
'Not that way,' called Maxim.

1192
00:59:12,790 --> 00:59:14,790
'Come on, old boy.'

1193
00:59:14,790 --> 00:59:16,710
The dog looked back at us.

1194
00:59:16,710 --> 00:59:18,940
He stood there, wagging his tail.

1195
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:21,100
'Why does he want to go that way?'

1196
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:22,100
I asked.

1197
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:25,400
'I suppose he's used to it,' Maxim said quickly.

1198
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:28,840
'It leads to a small bay where we used to
keep a boat.

1199
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:32,380
Come on, Jasper, old boy, this way.'

1200
00:59:32,380 --> 00:59:35,590
We turned on to the left-hand path, not saying
anything.

1201
00:59:35,590 --> 00:59:38,830
I looked over my shoulder and saw that Jasper
was following us.

1202
00:59:38,830 --> 00:59:43,220
'This path brings us to the valley I told
you about,' Maxim told me.

1203
00:59:43,220 --> 00:59:45,420
'You can smell the flowers already.

1204
00:59:45,420 --> 00:59:49,430
Never mind the rain, it will bring out the
scent.'

1205
00:59:49,430 --> 00:59:52,710
Maxim seemed all right again now, happy and
cheerful.

1206
00:59:52,710 --> 00:59:54,990
He began talking about Frank Crawley.

1207
00:59:54,990 --> 00:59:58,890
He told me what a good agent he was and how
he loved Manderley.

1208
00:59:58,890 --> 01:00:03,460
I held Maxim's arm and looked up into his
face.

1209
01:00:03,460 --> 01:00:05,740
Talking about Manderley always made Maxim
happy again.

1210
01:00:05,740 --> 01:00:08,840
We had reached the top of a small hill.

1211
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:12,660
The path ran down into a little valley, by
the side of a stream.

1212
01:00:12,660 --> 01:00:15,700
'There,' said Maxim, 'look at that.'

1213
01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:20,290
There were no dark trees in this valley, no
thick bushes.

1214
01:00:20,290 --> 01:00:25,230
On either side of the narrow path stood high
graceful bushes covered with flowers.

1215
01:00:25,230 --> 01:00:27,550
The flowers were pink, white and gold.

1216
01:00:27,550 --> 01:00:31,040
They were things of beauty and grace.

1217
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:34,720
The soft summer rain fell and the air was
full of a sweet scent.

1218
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:39,510
There was no sound except for the noise of
a little stream and the quiet rain on the

1219
01:00:39,510 --> 01:00:41,070
leaves.

1220
01:00:41,070 --> 01:00:43,970
When Maxim spoke, his voice was gentle and
low.

1221
01:00:43,970 --> 01:00:48,780
'We call it the Happy Valley,' he said.

1222
01:00:48,780 --> 01:00:50,530
We stood still, not speaking.

1223
01:00:50,530 --> 01:00:54,190
I looked down at the clear white flowers.

1224
01:00:54,190 --> 01:00:56,780
Maxim picked up a fallen flower and gave it
to me.

1225
01:00:56,780 --> 01:01:01,560
As I rubbed it between my hands, the scent
was sweet and strong.

1226
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:06,030
A bird began to sing, a high, clear sound.

1227
01:01:06,030 --> 01:01:08,330
Other birds began to sing too.

1228
01:01:08,330 --> 01:01:11,150
I had never been in so beautiful a place.

1229
01:01:11,150 --> 01:01:16,330
As we walked along the path, drops of rain
fell on my hands and face.

1230
01:01:16,330 --> 01:01:18,440
I held Maxim's hand.

1231
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:31,670
The Happy Valley was the heart of Manderley,
the Manderley I would soon know and love.

1232
01:01:31,670 --> 01:01:36,570
CHAPTER NINE
The Cottage in the Bay

1233
01:01:36,570 --> 01:01:40,810
We came to the end of the path.

1234
01:01:40,810 --> 01:01:44,560
The bushes made an arch over our heads so
that we had to bend down.

1235
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:48,280
I stood straight again, brushing the rain
from my head.

1236
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:50,990
I saw that the valley was behind us.

1237
01:01:50,990 --> 01:01:54,670
We were standing in a little narrow bay.

1238
01:01:54,670 --> 01:01:58,720
There, almost at our feet was the sea.

1239
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:01,380
Maxim looked down at me, smiling at the surprise
on my face.

1240
01:02:01,380 --> 01:02:04,460
'It is a surprise, isn't it?' he said.

1241
01:02:04,460 --> 01:02:06,740
'No one ever expects it.'

1242
01:02:06,740 --> 01:02:09,750
Maxim picked up a stone and threw it across
the beach for Jasper.

1243
01:02:09,750 --> 01:02:12,980
'Fetch it, good boy,' he said.

1244
01:02:12,980 --> 01:02:16,480
Jasper ran after the stone, barking with excitement.

1245
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:19,990
We both went down to the water's edge and
threw more stones.

1246
01:02:19,990 --> 01:02:25,080
The tide was coming up into the bay and the
water was beginning to cover the stones.

1247
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:27,840
Maxim turned to me, laughing and wiping the
hair out of his eyes.

1248
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:30,780
I rolled up the long sleeves of the raincoat.

1249
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:33,230
It was a happy moment.

1250
01:02:33,230 --> 01:02:34,810
Then we saw that Jasper had gone.

1251
01:02:34,810 --> 01:02:37,320
We called and whistled, but he did not come.

1252
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:39,870
'Has he gone back to the Happy Valley?'

1253
01:02:39,870 --> 01:02:40,870
I asked.

1254
01:02:40,870 --> 01:02:44,590
'He was by that rock a minute ago,' said Maxim.

1255
01:02:44,590 --> 01:02:47,800
We walked up the beach towards the valley
again.

1256
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:51,330
'Jasper, Jasper,' called Maxim.

1257
01:02:51,330 --> 01:02:57,170
In the distance, beyond a line of rocks to
the right of the beach, I heard a sharp bark.

1258
01:02:57,170 --> 01:02:58,570
'Do you hear that?'

1259
01:02:58,570 --> 01:02:59,570
I said.

1260
01:02:59,570 --> 01:03:01,010
'He's gone over this way.'

1261
01:03:01,010 --> 01:03:02,980
I began to climb up the wet rocks.

1262
01:03:02,980 --> 01:03:07,420
'Come back,' Maxim said sharply, 'we don't
want to go that way.'

1263
01:03:07,420 --> 01:03:09,690
'I must get him,' I said.

1264
01:03:09,690 --> 01:03:10,810
'He may be hurt.'

1265
01:03:10,810 --> 01:03:13,060
'He's all right,' said Maxim.

1266
01:03:13,060 --> 01:03:14,060
'Leave him.

1267
01:03:14,060 --> 01:03:16,230
He knows the way home.'

1268
01:03:16,230 --> 01:03:18,910
I began climbing over the rocks towards Jasper.

1269
01:03:18,910 --> 01:03:20,920
I thought Maxim was being very unkind.

1270
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:24,480
I got to the top of the largest rock and looked
beyond it.

1271
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:26,700
There was another bay.

1272
01:03:26,700 --> 01:03:30,910
A small stone wall across the bay made it
into a small harbour.

1273
01:03:30,910 --> 01:03:32,960
In the bay was a green and white buoy, but
no boat.

1274
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:36,760
The woods came right down to the shore.

1275
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:41,660
At the edge of the woods was a low stone building,
a cottage or a boat-house.

1276
01:03:41,660 --> 01:03:45,280
There was a man standing on the shore, dressed
like a fisherman.

1277
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:47,890
Jasper was barking at him and running round
and round.

1278
01:03:47,890 --> 01:03:52,090
The man took no notice of the dog.

1279
01:03:52,090 --> 01:03:55,180
'Jasper,' I shouted, 'Jasper, come here.'

1280
01:03:55,180 --> 01:03:58,000
The dog looked up, but he did not come to
me.

1281
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,930
I looked back, but I could not see Maxim.

1282
01:04:00,930 --> 01:04:04,580
I climbed down into the bay and the man looked
at me for the first time.

1283
01:04:04,580 --> 01:04:07,830
There was something strange about him.

1284
01:04:07,830 --> 01:04:10,090
He had small, stupid looking eyes.

1285
01:04:10,090 --> 01:04:15,120
His face was fat and round and he had thick,
red lips.

1286
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:16,970
'Bad weather, isn't it?'

1287
01:04:16,970 --> 01:04:19,580
the man said with a stupid smile.

1288
01:04:19,580 --> 01:04:21,150
'It's not very nice weather,' I said.

1289
01:04:21,150 --> 01:04:25,110
'Come on Jasper, we must go home now.'

1290
01:04:25,110 --> 01:04:27,000
But Jasper ran away, barking.

1291
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,700
'Have you got any string?'

1292
01:04:28,700 --> 01:04:31,570
I asked the man.

1293
01:04:31,570 --> 01:04:33,750
'I want something to tie the dog.

1294
01:04:33,750 --> 01:04:35,970
He won't follow me.'

1295
01:04:35,970 --> 01:04:39,810
'I know that dog, it's not yours.

1296
01:04:39,810 --> 01:04:42,290
It comes from the house.'

1297
01:04:42,290 --> 01:04:45,900
'He's Mr de Winter's dog,' I said kindly.

1298
01:04:45,900 --> 01:04:48,540
'I must take him back.'

1299
01:04:48,540 --> 01:04:52,990
The man said nothing, but stared at me in
the same stupid way.

1300
01:04:52,990 --> 01:04:54,450
I walked up the shore to the cottage.

1301
01:04:54,450 --> 01:04:56,650
Perhaps there was some string there.

1302
01:04:56,650 --> 01:05:00,040
The grass round the little house had grown
very long.

1303
01:05:00,040 --> 01:05:02,860
The windows had pieces of wood over them.

1304
01:05:02,860 --> 01:05:05,270
I pushed at the door.

1305
01:05:05,270 --> 01:05:08,230
To my surprise it opened and I went inside.

1306
01:05:08,230 --> 01:05:11,910
The room was furnished and there were books
on the shelves.

1307
01:05:11,910 --> 01:05:15,180
But everything was covered with thick dust.

1308
01:05:15,180 --> 01:05:17,130
The air was damp and still.

1309
01:05:17,130 --> 01:05:20,780
Another door at the end of the room led into
a small boat-house.

1310
01:05:20,780 --> 01:05:23,830
I saw some string on a shelf and an old knife.

1311
01:05:23,830 --> 01:05:26,810
I cut a piece of string for Jasper and went
out of the cottage.

1312
01:05:26,810 --> 01:05:30,490
There was something frightening about that
small, dark room.

1313
01:05:30,490 --> 01:05:33,000
I was glad to be outside again.

1314
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:37,150
The man was still watching me, staring like
a child.

1315
01:05:37,150 --> 01:05:40,140
Jasper was quiet now and let me tie the string.

1316
01:05:40,140 --> 01:05:44,660
'I saw you go in there,' the man said.

1317
01:05:44,660 --> 01:05:47,540
'She doesn't go in there now.

1318
01:05:47,540 --> 01:05:49,720
She's gone in the sea.

1319
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:52,120
She won't come back, will she?'

1320
01:05:52,120 --> 01:05:53,880
'No,' I said.

1321
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:57,480
'She won't come back.'

1322
01:05:57,480 --> 01:06:00,200
'I didn't say anything, did I?'

1323
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:02,510
The man's eyes were full of fear.

1324
01:06:02,510 --> 01:06:06,860
He turned away and walked back towards the
sea.

1325
01:06:06,860 --> 01:06:08,890
Maxim was waiting for me beside the rocks.

1326
01:06:08,890 --> 01:06:10,330
He looked angry.

1327
01:06:10,330 --> 01:06:12,572
'I'm sorry,' I said.

1328
01:06:12,572 --> 01:06:14,870
'I had to get some string for Jasper.

1329
01:06:14,870 --> 01:06:17,940
Who is that man?'

1330
01:06:17,940 --> 01:06:18,940
'That's Ben.

1331
01:06:18,940 --> 01:06:21,120
He's a bit mad, but he won't hurt you.

1332
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:23,080
Where did you get that string?'

1333
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:24,910
'I found it in the cottage.

1334
01:06:24,910 --> 01:06:25,910
The door was open.

1335
01:06:25,910 --> 01:06:27,180
There's dust everywhere.

1336
01:06:27,180 --> 01:06:29,320
The place ought to be cleaned.'

1337
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:32,020
'The door should be locked,' Maxim said.

1338
01:06:32,020 --> 01:06:34,340
He was walking very fast now.

1339
01:06:34,340 --> 01:06:37,410
He went up past the cottage and on to a path
through the woods.

1340
01:06:37,410 --> 01:06:41,030
It was very different here from the Happy
Valley.

1341
01:06:41,030 --> 01:06:43,880
The path was steep and the trees were thick,
and dark.

1342
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:47,520
It was cold now and my legs ached.

1343
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:49,900
Jasper was tired too, and walked very slowly.

1344
01:06:49,900 --> 01:06:54,500
'Come on, Jasper, for God's sake,' said Maxim
angrily.

1345
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:57,650
'Pull at that string, can't you?' he said
to me.

1346
01:06:57,650 --> 01:07:01,240
'It's your fault,' I said, 'you walk so fast.'

1347
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:03,720
'If you had listened to me, we would be home
by now.

1348
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:05,810
There was no need for you to go after Jasper.'

1349
01:07:05,810 --> 01:07:08,910
'I thought you would come with me,' I answered.

1350
01:07:08,910 --> 01:07:11,980
'Why should I run after the damned dog?'

1351
01:07:11,980 --> 01:07:13,640
Maxim said, not looking at me.

1352
01:07:13,640 --> 01:07:15,740
'That's an excuse.

1353
01:07:15,740 --> 01:07:17,560
You didn't want to go over the rocks,' I answered.

1354
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:19,400
'All right, I didn't.

1355
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:21,050
I didn't want to go to the other bay.

1356
01:07:21,050 --> 01:07:24,040
I never go near the place or that damned cottage.

1357
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:26,440
If you had my memories, you would not go there
either.

1358
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:30,220
You wouldn't talk about it or even think about
it.'

1359
01:07:30,220 --> 01:07:31,730
Maxim's face was white.

1360
01:07:31,730 --> 01:07:33,500
His eyes had a dark, lost look.

1361
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:36,300
I took his hand and held it tight.

1362
01:07:36,300 --> 01:07:38,830
'Please, Maxim, please,' I said.

1363
01:07:38,830 --> 01:07:40,460
'I don't want you to look like that.

1364
01:07:40,460 --> 01:07:41,750
I'm sorry, darling.

1365
01:07:41,750 --> 01:07:43,890
Please don't let us quarrel.'

1366
01:07:43,890 --> 01:07:47,250
'We should have stayed in Italy,' Maxim said.

1367
01:07:47,250 --> 01:07:49,830
'I was a fool to bring you back to Manderley.'

1368
01:07:49,830 --> 01:07:52,530
I had to run to keep up with him now.

1369
01:07:52,530 --> 01:07:56,770
At last we came to the top of the path and
out on to the lawn.

1370
01:07:56,770 --> 01:07:58,520
Maxim's face was hard.

1371
01:07:58,520 --> 01:08:01,070
He walked straight into the house and spoke
to Frith.

1372
01:08:01,070 --> 01:08:04,090
'We want tea at once,' said Maxim.

1373
01:08:04,090 --> 01:08:07,330
Then he went quickly into the library and
shut the door.

1374
01:08:07,330 --> 01:08:10,640
I tried to keep back my tears.

1375
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:12,590
Frith must not see them.

1376
01:08:12,590 --> 01:08:14,880
I turned away as he helped me off with the
raincoat.

1377
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:17,290
He picked up a handkerchief.

1378
01:08:17,290 --> 01:08:19,799
'Is this yours, Madam?' he said.

1379
01:08:19,799 --> 01:08:25,690
I put the handkerchief in my pocket and walked
slowly across the hall to the library.

1380
01:08:25,690 --> 01:08:29,219
Maxim was sitting in his usual chair, with
Jasper at his feet.

1381
01:08:29,219 --> 01:08:33,779
I walked across the room and knelt down by
Maxim's chair.

1382
01:08:33,779 --> 01:08:36,989
'Don't be angry with me any more,' I said.

1383
01:08:36,989 --> 01:08:39,509
Maxim looked down at me.

1384
01:08:39,509 --> 01:08:41,769
'I'm not angry with you,' he said.

1385
01:08:41,769 --> 01:08:44,639
'But I've made you unhappy,' I replied.

1386
01:08:44,639 --> 01:08:47,380
'I want you to be happy so much.

1387
01:08:47,380 --> 01:08:49,279
I love you.'

1388
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:52,100
'Do you?' he said.

1389
01:08:52,100 --> 01:08:54,100
His eyes were full of pain and fear.

1390
01:08:54,100 --> 01:08:56,900
'What is it, darling?'

1391
01:08:56,900 --> 01:08:57,900
I said.

1392
01:08:57,900 --> 01:08:58,900
'Why do you look like that?'

1393
01:08:58,900 --> 01:09:01,599
The door opened before Maxim could answer.

1394
01:09:01,599 --> 01:09:04,639
It was Frith and Robert with the tea.

1395
01:09:04,639 --> 01:09:08,750
The small table was put near the fire and
covered with the white cloth.

1396
01:09:08,750 --> 01:09:11,409
Frith brought in the silver teapot and kettle.

1397
01:09:11,409 --> 01:09:14,710
Then came the cups, the sandwiches and cakes.

1398
01:09:14,710 --> 01:09:16,779
Everything was the same as yesterday.

1399
01:09:16,779 --> 01:09:19,519
When the servants had gone, I looked at Maxim's
face.

1400
01:09:19,519 --> 01:09:21,759
The colour had come back into it.

1401
01:09:21,759 --> 01:09:23,349
He took a sandwich.

1402
01:09:23,349 --> 01:09:27,009
'Pour me a cup of tea, darling,' he said to
me.

1403
01:09:27,009 --> 01:09:29,159
'And forgive me for being so unkind.'

1404
01:09:29,159 --> 01:09:32,759
There was nothing more to say.

1405
01:09:32,759 --> 01:09:36,790
Maxim smiled at me and picked up his paper.

1406
01:09:36,790 --> 01:09:40,890
Maxim's smile was like a pat on the head given
to Jasper.

1407
01:09:40,890 --> 01:09:42,960
I was not hungry and I felt very tired.

1408
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:47,880
I gave Jasper a piece of cake and took out
the handkerchief to wipe my hands.

1409
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:50,389
The handkerchief was not mine.

1410
01:09:50,389 --> 01:09:53,839
It must have come from the raincoat pocket.

1411
01:09:53,839 --> 01:09:59,440
There were some letters in the corner - a
tall "R" and "de W." It was Rebecca's.

1412
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:05,650
The raincoat, too wide, too long for me, must
have been hers too.

1413
01:10:05,650 --> 01:10:07,250
Rebecca had worn that raincoat.

1414
01:10:07,250 --> 01:10:09,880
She had left the handkerchief in the pocket.

1415
01:10:09,880 --> 01:10:12,900
I could smell a scent, a scent I knew.

1416
01:10:12,900 --> 01:10:16,539
I shut my eyes and tried to remember what
it was.

1417
01:10:16,539 --> 01:10:18,860
Suddenly I knew.

1418
01:10:18,860 --> 01:10:22,989
The scent on the handkerchief was the scent
of the flowers in the Happy Valley.

1419
01:10:22,989 --> 01:10:30,760
Was there nowhere I could escape from Rebecca?

1420
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:45,530
CHAPTER TEN
Questions and Answers

1421
01:10:45,530 --> 01:10:51,309
The weather was wet and cold for over a week.

1422
01:10:51,309 --> 01:10:53,119
We did not go down to the beach again.

1423
01:10:53,119 --> 01:10:56,300
I could see the sea from the terrace and the
lawns.

1424
01:10:56,300 --> 01:10:59,369
It looked cold and grey.

1425
01:10:59,369 --> 01:11:03,289
When I stood on the terrace, I could hear
the sound of great waves on the shore.

1426
01:11:03,289 --> 01:11:09,190
I began to understand why some people hated
the low, angry voice of the sea.

1427
01:11:09,190 --> 01:11:12,159
I was glad that our rooms were in the east
wing.

1428
01:11:12,159 --> 01:11:16,889
If I could not sleep, I went to the window
and looked out on to the rose-garden.

1429
01:11:16,889 --> 01:11:21,769
I was not troubled by the sea's unhappy music.

1430
01:11:21,769 --> 01:11:23,829
Sometimes I thought about the cottage down
in the bay.

1431
01:11:23,829 --> 01:11:27,789
There were so many questions I wanted to ask
Maxim.

1432
01:11:27,789 --> 01:11:30,369
I could not forget the lost look in Maxim's
eyes.

1433
01:11:30,369 --> 01:11:37,090
I could not forget his words: 'I was a fool
to bring you back to Manderley.'

1434
01:11:37,090 --> 01:11:38,760
It was all my fault.

1435
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:40,440
I had gone down into the bay.

1436
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:43,010
I had reminded Maxim of the past.

1437
01:11:43,010 --> 01:11:45,870
We lived our lives together sleeping, eating,
walking.

1438
01:11:45,870 --> 01:11:51,010
But, every hour of the day, the past made
a wall between us.

1439
01:11:51,010 --> 01:11:54,800
I became nervous and afraid.

1440
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:58,150
I did not want anyone to talk about the sea
or boats.

1441
01:11:58,150 --> 01:12:01,269
When visitors came to Manderley, I was shy
and awkward.

1442
01:12:01,269 --> 01:12:04,699
I knew that they compared me with Rebecca.

1443
01:12:04,699 --> 01:12:07,300
She had been charming, interested in everyone.

1444
01:12:07,300 --> 01:12:11,429
I was dull and stupid, like a schoolgirl.

1445
01:12:11,429 --> 01:12:15,460
One afternoon, I was having tea alone when
the wife of the bishop called.

1446
01:12:15,460 --> 01:12:18,940
She was a kind woman and tried hard to make
me talk.

1447
01:12:18,940 --> 01:12:20,800
At last she said,

1448
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:26,070
'Will your husband hold the Manderley Fancy
Dress Ball this year?

1449
01:12:26,070 --> 01:12:29,040
I remember the last one so well.

1450
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:30,719
It was such a lovely sight.

1451
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:33,260
I shall never forget it.'

1452
01:12:33,260 --> 01:12:36,199
I smiled and said, 'We have not decided.

1453
01:12:36,199 --> 01:12:39,150
There have been so many things to do.'

1454
01:12:39,150 --> 01:12:43,610
I could not tell the woman that Maxim had
never spoken about the ball.

1455
01:12:43,610 --> 01:12:47,860
'Manderley looked so beautiful,' the bishop's
wife went on.

1456
01:12:47,860 --> 01:12:52,800
'And there was dancing, and music and flowers
everywhere.'

1457
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:55,010
'Yes,' I said.

1458
01:12:55,010 --> 01:12:57,860
'Yes, I must ask Maxim about it.'

1459
01:12:57,860 --> 01:13:02,659
'We came to a garden-party too, one summer,'
the bishop's wife went on.

1460
01:13:02,659 --> 01:13:04,770
'It was a lovely day.

1461
01:13:04,770 --> 01:13:06,570
We all had tea in the rose-garden.

1462
01:13:06,570 --> 01:13:08,699
It was such a clever idea.

1463
01:13:08,699 --> 01:13:12,820
Of course, she was a clever person.'

1464
01:13:12,820 --> 01:13:15,000
She stopped, her face rather red.

1465
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:19,420
I heard myself saying, 'Rebecca must have
been a wonderful person...'

1466
01:13:19,420 --> 01:13:23,100
I had said her name at last.

1467
01:13:23,100 --> 01:13:24,280
'Rebecca.'

1468
01:13:24,280 --> 01:13:26,220
I had said it aloud.

1469
01:13:26,220 --> 01:13:28,489
'You never met her then?'

1470
01:13:28,489 --> 01:13:29,739
the woman asked.

1471
01:13:29,739 --> 01:13:32,059
'Yes, she was a lovely person.

1472
01:13:32,059 --> 01:13:34,120
So full of life.

1473
01:13:34,120 --> 01:13:35,120
Everyone loved her.'

1474
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:39,160
'She was so good at everything too,' I said.

1475
01:13:39,160 --> 01:13:42,070
'Clever, beautiful and fond of sport.'

1476
01:13:42,070 --> 01:13:45,740
'Rebecca was certainly beautiful,' my visitor
went on.

1477
01:13:45,740 --> 01:13:48,579
'I remember her on the night of the Ball.

1478
01:13:48,579 --> 01:13:51,050
She had a cloud of dark hair.

1479
01:13:51,050 --> 01:13:55,039
Her skin was very white.

1480
01:13:55,039 --> 01:13:56,039
And she had such a lovely dress.'

1481
01:13:56,039 --> 01:13:58,750
'She looked after everything in the house,
too,' I said.

1482
01:13:58,750 --> 01:14:01,520
'I'm afraid I leave it all to the housekeeper.'

1483
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:04,760
'Oh well, you are very young, aren't you?

1484
01:14:04,760 --> 01:14:06,760
We can't all do everything.

1485
01:14:06,760 --> 01:14:09,289
I must go now.

1486
01:14:09,289 --> 01:14:11,860
Do ask your husband to have another ball.'

1487
01:14:11,860 --> 01:14:16,480
'Yes, of course I will.'

1488
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:19,050
I sat in the library after my visitor had
gone.

1489
01:14:19,050 --> 01:14:24,580
I thought about Manderley, full of people
in beautiful costumes, dancing in the hall.

1490
01:14:24,580 --> 01:14:28,840
I thought of Rebecca, lively and beautiful,
arranging everything.

1491
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:32,940
What must people think about me?

1492
01:14:32,940 --> 01:14:34,639
I suddenly sat up straight.

1493
01:14:34,639 --> 01:14:37,820
I did not mind.

1494
01:14:37,820 --> 01:14:38,820
I did not care.

1495
01:14:38,820 --> 01:14:41,579
I was Mrs de Winter now, not Rebecca.

1496
01:14:41,579 --> 01:14:44,010
I decided that I would find out more about
the Fancy Dress Ball.

1497
01:14:44,010 --> 01:14:46,330
But I did not want to ask Maxim.

1498
01:14:46,330 --> 01:14:51,050
Later that afternoon, Frank Crawley came up
to the house.

1499
01:14:51,050 --> 01:14:55,159
'I have been hearing about the Fancy Dress
Ball, Frank,' I said.

1500
01:14:55,159 --> 01:14:59,090
'I did not know you had dances here.'

1501
01:14:59,090 --> 01:15:00,980
Frank did not reply at once.

1502
01:15:00,980 --> 01:15:05,570
Then he said, 'The Manderley Ball was held
every year.

1503
01:15:05,570 --> 01:15:07,409
People came from miles around.

1504
01:15:07,409 --> 01:15:10,159
They even came down from London.'

1505
01:15:10,159 --> 01:15:13,610
'It must have been a lot of work,' I said.

1506
01:15:13,610 --> 01:15:16,000
'I suppose Rebecca did most of it.'

1507
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,699
Frank looked straight ahead.

1508
01:15:17,699 --> 01:15:20,800
'We all helped,' he said.

1509
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:23,670
'Will you ask Maxim about the Ball?'

1510
01:15:23,670 --> 01:15:24,710
I asked.

1511
01:15:24,710 --> 01:15:27,820
'It does seem a good idea.'

1512
01:15:27,820 --> 01:15:30,090
Frank did not answer me.

1513
01:15:30,090 --> 01:15:34,500
'I went into that cottage in the bay a few
days ago,' I said.

1514
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:35,910
'It's very dirty.

1515
01:15:35,910 --> 01:15:39,050
Why doesn't someone do something about it?'

1516
01:15:39,050 --> 01:15:43,940
'Maxim would tell me if he wanted anything
done,' Frank replied.

1517
01:15:43,940 --> 01:15:45,930
'Are they Rebecca's things?'

1518
01:15:45,930 --> 01:15:46,930
I asked.

1519
01:15:46,930 --> 01:15:49,440
'Yes,' Frank said.

1520
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:52,179
'Did Rebecca use the cottage a lot?'

1521
01:15:52,179 --> 01:15:53,909
'Yes, she did.

1522
01:15:53,909 --> 01:15:56,440
She slept in the cottage sometimes.

1523
01:15:56,440 --> 01:15:59,929
She had moonlight picnics on the shore.'

1524
01:15:59,929 --> 01:16:02,560
I noticed that Frank always called Rebecca
'she'.

1525
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:04,469
He never used her name.

1526
01:16:04,469 --> 01:16:07,500
'Why is there a buoy in the bay?'

1527
01:16:07,500 --> 01:16:08,500
I asked.

1528
01:16:08,500 --> 01:16:09,780
'There's no boat there.

1529
01:16:09,780 --> 01:16:10,780
What happened to it?

1530
01:16:10,780 --> 01:16:14,159
Was it the boat Rebecca was sailing when she
died?'

1531
01:16:14,159 --> 01:16:17,320
'Yes,' said Frank, quietly.

1532
01:16:17,320 --> 01:16:20,210
'It turned over and sank.

1533
01:16:20,210 --> 01:16:22,300
She was washed overboard and drowned.

1534
01:16:22,300 --> 01:16:26,900
The sea is sometimes very rough in the bay.'

1535
01:16:26,900 --> 01:16:28,610
'Couldn't anyone have helped her?'

1536
01:16:28,610 --> 01:16:30,350
I asked.

1537
01:16:30,350 --> 01:16:32,340
'Nobody saw the accident.

1538
01:16:32,340 --> 01:16:34,389
Nobody knew she was sailing.

1539
01:16:34,389 --> 01:16:36,800
She often went out alone like that.'

1540
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:39,280
'When did they find her?'

1541
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:41,090
I felt I must know everything now.

1542
01:16:41,090 --> 01:16:44,869
I had been thinking about that terrible night
for so long.

1543
01:16:44,869 --> 01:16:47,679
'They found her two months later.

1544
01:16:47,679 --> 01:16:51,380
The sea had carried her forty miles up the
coast.

1545
01:16:51,380 --> 01:16:54,670
Maxim had to identify the body.'

1546
01:16:54,670 --> 01:16:57,860
Suddenly I was ashamed of all my questions.

1547
01:16:57,860 --> 01:17:01,410
'Frank,' I said, 'I'm sorry I asked you all
those questions.

1548
01:17:01,410 --> 01:17:04,239
But everything is so strange to me at Manderley.

1549
01:17:04,239 --> 01:17:10,449
And when I meet anyone new, I know what they
are thinking: "How different she is from Rebecca."

1550
01:17:10,449 --> 01:17:11,449
'

1551
01:17:11,449 --> 01:17:16,810
'Mrs de Winter, you mustn't think that,' said
Frank, looking at me for the first time.

1552
01:17:16,810 --> 01:17:19,889
'I am so glad you have married Maxim.

1553
01:17:19,889 --> 01:17:22,349
It will make such a difference to his life.

1554
01:17:22,349 --> 01:17:28,540
And Manderley needs someone like you, someone
young, fresh and charming.'

1555
01:17:28,540 --> 01:17:32,389
'But Rebecca was so charming - and clever.

1556
01:17:32,389 --> 01:17:34,699
People still remember her.'

1557
01:17:34,699 --> 01:17:39,719
'Maxim would be very unhappy to hear you talking
like this, Mrs de Winter.

1558
01:17:39,719 --> 01:17:41,840
Forget the past, as Maxim has done.

1559
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:44,420
None of us want to bring back the past.

1560
01:17:44,420 --> 01:17:48,730
Your job here is to lead us away from it.'

1561
01:17:48,730 --> 01:17:49,730
I was much happier now.

1562
01:17:49,730 --> 01:17:52,820
But I had to ask Frank one more question.

1563
01:17:52,820 --> 01:17:56,349
Tell me, Frank,' I said.

1564
01:17:56,349 --> 01:17:59,170
'Was Rebecca very beautiful?'

1565
01:17:59,170 --> 01:18:02,060
Frank turned away from me so that I could
not see his face.

1566
01:18:02,060 --> 01:18:05,540
'Yes,' he said slowly.

1567
01:18:05,540 --> 01:18:30,429
'Yes, I suppose she was the most beautiful
woman I ever saw in my life.'

1568
01:18:30,429 --> 01:18:41,489
CHAPTER ELEVEN
The China Cupid

1569
01:18:41,489 --> 01:19:04,389
Frank had 

1570
01:19:04,389 --> 01:19:06,489
told me to forget the past.

1571
01:19:06,489 --> 01:19:07,610
I wanted to.

1572
01:19:07,610 --> 01:19:11,150
But Frank did not sit in the morning room
every day as I did.

1573
01:19:11,150 --> 01:19:14,840
He did not sit at Rebecca's desk and touch
the things she had touched.

1574
01:19:14,840 --> 01:19:18,360
Dear God, I did not want to think about Rebecca.

1575
01:19:18,360 --> 01:19:20,270
I wanted to be happy.

1576
01:19:20,270 --> 01:19:22,139
I wanted Maxim to be happy too.

1577
01:19:22,139 --> 01:19:26,199
But Rebecca was always in my thoughts and
dreams.

1578
01:19:26,199 --> 01:19:30,920
Beatrice, Maxim's sister, had promised to
give me a wedding present.

1579
01:19:30,920 --> 01:19:32,699
She did not forget.

1580
01:19:32,699 --> 01:19:36,429
One day, Robert brought a large parcel into
the morning-room where I was sitting alone.

1581
01:19:36,429 --> 01:19:40,130
I cut the string excitedly and tore off the
dark brown paper.

1582
01:19:40,130 --> 01:19:43,670
Beatrice had sent me four big books about
painting.

1583
01:19:43,670 --> 01:19:48,080
She knew that I enjoyed sketching and she
had really tried to please me.

1584
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:52,750
I was glad to have something at Manderley
that belonged to me.

1585
01:19:52,750 --> 01:19:55,119
I looked round the room for somewhere to put
the books.

1586
01:19:55,119 --> 01:19:58,809
I stood them in a row on top of the desk and
looked at them.

1587
01:19:58,809 --> 01:20:01,930
But the books were far too heavy.

1588
01:20:01,930 --> 01:20:04,150
First one fell and then the others followed.

1589
01:20:04,150 --> 01:20:09,440
A little china ornament which always stood
on the desk was knocked on to the floor.

1590
01:20:09,440 --> 01:20:11,579
The ornament broke into many pieces.

1591
01:20:11,579 --> 01:20:17,500
It was a beautiful little cupid and one of
the loveliest things in the house.

1592
01:20:17,500 --> 01:20:19,760
I was suddenly very frightened.

1593
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:24,340
I found an envelope in a drawer and carefully
put the pieces of china into it.

1594
01:20:24,340 --> 01:20:28,269
Then, like a child, I hid the envelope in
the desk.

1595
01:20:28,269 --> 01:20:32,999
I decided to put my new books in the library
and I said nothing about the cupid.

1596
01:20:32,999 --> 01:20:39,650
The following day, after lunch, Frith brought
our coffee to the library as usual.

1597
01:20:39,650 --> 01:20:43,039
Instead of leaving, he stood by Maxim's chair.

1598
01:20:43,039 --> 01:20:45,949
'Could I speak to you, sir?' he said.

1599
01:20:45,949 --> 01:20:47,820
Maxim looked up from his paper.

1600
01:20:47,820 --> 01:20:51,010
'Yes, Frith, what is it?'

1601
01:20:51,010 --> 01:20:52,719
'It's about Robert, sir.

1602
01:20:52,719 --> 01:20:54,679
He's very upset.

1603
01:20:54,679 --> 01:20:59,570
Mrs Danvers has accused him of taking a valuable
ornament from the morning-room.

1604
01:20:59,570 --> 01:21:03,449
Mrs Danvers noticed it was missing late this
morning.

1605
01:21:03,449 --> 01:21:06,510
She says that Robert must have taken it or
broken it.

1606
01:21:06,510 --> 01:21:10,369
Robert says he knows nothing about it.'

1607
01:21:10,369 --> 01:21:13,420
'Perhaps it was one of the maids,' said Maxim.

1608
01:21:13,420 --> 01:21:16,170
I knew he hated any kind of trouble with the
servants.

1609
01:21:16,170 --> 01:21:17,570
'No, sir.

1610
01:21:17,570 --> 01:21:22,219
No one except Robert has been in the room,
apart from Madam, of course.

1611
01:21:22,219 --> 01:21:25,719
Mrs Danvers doesn't let the maids clean the
morning-room.'

1612
01:21:25,719 --> 01:21:29,219
'Well, Mrs Danvers had better come and see
me.

1613
01:21:29,219 --> 01:21:31,489
What ornament was it?'

1614
01:21:31,489 --> 01:21:34,050
'The china cupid, sir.

1615
01:21:34,050 --> 01:21:35,909
It stands on the desk.'

1616
01:21:35,909 --> 01:21:37,699
'Oh dear,' said Maxim.

1617
01:21:37,699 --> 01:21:39,040
'That's very valuable.

1618
01:21:39,040 --> 01:21:41,130
It must be found.

1619
01:21:41,130 --> 01:21:43,480
I'll see Mrs Danvers at once.'

1620
01:21:43,480 --> 01:21:48,679
'Very good, sir,' said Frith and quietly left
the room.

1621
01:21:48,679 --> 01:21:54,540
'Darling,' I said to Maxim when we were alone,
'I meant to tell you before, but I forgot.

1622
01:21:54,540 --> 01:21:58,039
I broke the cupid yesterday.'

1623
01:21:58,039 --> 01:21:59,039
'You broke it?

1624
01:21:59,039 --> 01:22:01,809
Why didn't you say so when Frith was here?

1625
01:22:01,809 --> 01:22:04,020
You'll have to explain to Mrs Danvers now.'

1626
01:22:04,020 --> 01:22:05,219
'Oh no.

1627
01:22:05,219 --> 01:22:07,539
Please, Maxim, you tell her.

1628
01:22:07,539 --> 01:22:09,300
Let me go upstairs.'

1629
01:22:09,300 --> 01:22:12,130
'Don't be silly,' said Maxim angrily.

1630
01:22:12,130 --> 01:22:14,219
'Anyone would think you were afraid of Mrs
Danvers.'

1631
01:22:14,219 --> 01:22:16,210
'I am afraid of her.

1632
01:22:16,210 --> 01:22:18,710
At least not afraid, but...'

1633
01:22:18,710 --> 01:22:23,159
The door opened without a sound and Mrs Danvers
came into the room.

1634
01:22:23,159 --> 01:22:25,499
I looked nervously at Maxim.

1635
01:22:25,499 --> 01:22:28,409
His face was half amused, half angry.

1636
01:22:28,409 --> 01:22:33,219
'It's all a mistake, Mrs Danvers,' Maxim told
her.

1637
01:22:33,219 --> 01:22:35,989
'Mrs de Winter broke the cupid herself.

1638
01:22:35,989 --> 01:22:38,110
She forgot to tell us.'

1639
01:22:38,110 --> 01:22:40,179
I felt like a child again.

1640
01:22:40,179 --> 01:22:45,510
'I'm so sorry,' I said, 'I never thought Robert
would get into trouble.'

1641
01:22:45,510 --> 01:22:51,510
'Is it possible to repair the cupid, Madam?'
said Mrs Danvers.

1642
01:22:51,510 --> 01:22:53,489
She did not seem surprised.

1643
01:22:53,489 --> 01:22:57,119
I felt she had known the truth all the time.

1644
01:22:57,119 --> 01:22:59,280
'I'm afraid not,' I said.

1645
01:22:59,280 --> 01:23:01,869
'It's in hundreds of pieces.'

1646
01:23:01,869 --> 01:23:04,449
'What did you do with the pieces?' said Maxim.

1647
01:23:04,449 --> 01:23:08,580
They are in an envelope in a drawer of the
writing desk.'

1648
01:23:08,580 --> 01:23:10,789
'Find the pieces, Mrs Danvers.

1649
01:23:10,789 --> 01:23:13,389
Try to get them mended in London.'

1650
01:23:13,389 --> 01:23:18,820
'I never thought that Mrs de Winter had broken
the ornament,' said Mrs Danvers.

1651
01:23:18,820 --> 01:23:24,599
As she left the room I could see the scorn
and hatred in her eyes.

1652
01:23:24,599 --> 01:23:26,580
'I'm very sorry, darling,' I said.

1653
01:23:26,580 --> 01:23:29,010
'It was very silly and careless of me.'

1654
01:23:29,010 --> 01:23:31,010
'Forget it,' said Maxim.

1655
01:23:31,010 --> 01:23:34,059
'But you do act strangely sometimes.

1656
01:23:34,059 --> 01:23:36,619
More like a servant than the mistress of Manderley.

1657
01:23:36,619 --> 01:23:41,880
Even when we have visitors, you sit on the
edge of your chair and say only "yes" and

1658
01:23:41,880 --> 01:23:42,880
"no".'

1659
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:44,350
'I can't help being shy.'

1660
01:23:44,350 --> 01:23:46,409
'I know you can't, darling.

1661
01:23:46,409 --> 01:23:48,749
But you must learn to hide it.'

1662
01:23:48,749 --> 01:23:50,239
'I do try.

1663
01:23:50,239 --> 01:23:52,650
But I'm not used to this kind of life.

1664
01:23:52,650 --> 01:23:56,719
People look at me and ask me so many questions.'

1665
01:23:56,719 --> 01:23:57,870
'What does it matter?

1666
01:23:57,870 --> 01:24:00,119
They are interested in us, that's all.'

1667
01:24:00,119 --> 01:24:03,510
'They can't find me very interesting,' I said.

1668
01:24:03,510 --> 01:24:06,070
'I suppose that's why you married me.

1669
01:24:06,070 --> 01:24:08,289
You knew I was dull and quiet.

1670
01:24:08,289 --> 01:24:10,960
No one would ever gossip about me.'

1671
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:13,800
Maxim threw his paper on the ground and got
up from his chair.

1672
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:18,710
His face was dark with anger and his voice
was hard.

1673
01:24:18,710 --> 01:24:21,380
'What do you know about any gossip down here?'
he said.

1674
01:24:21,380 --> 01:24:23,010
'Who's been talking to you?'

1675
01:24:23,010 --> 01:24:24,110
'No one.

1676
01:24:24,110 --> 01:24:26,309
No one at all.'

1677
01:24:26,309 --> 01:24:28,219
Maxim stared at me.

1678
01:24:28,219 --> 01:24:33,530
'Perhaps I did a very selfish thing when I
married you,' he said slowly.

1679
01:24:33,530 --> 01:24:37,880
'I am so much older than you.'

1680
01:24:37,880 --> 01:24:39,510
I felt cold and frightened.

1681
01:24:39,510 --> 01:24:42,880
'Age doesn't matter,' I said.

1682
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:44,239
'I'm happy.

1683
01:24:44,239 --> 01:24:47,340
You know I love you more than anything else
in the world.

1684
01:24:47,340 --> 01:24:48,739
I love Manderley too.

1685
01:24:48,739 --> 01:24:50,429
I love everything here.

1686
01:24:50,429 --> 01:24:54,269
You're happy too, darling, aren't you?'

1687
01:24:54,269 --> 01:24:55,869
Maxim did not answer.

1688
01:24:55,869 --> 01:24:57,969
He stood staring out of the window.

1689
01:24:57,969 --> 01:25:02,349
'If you don't think we're happy, you must
tell me,' I went on.

1690
01:25:02,349 --> 01:25:04,739
'I don't want you to lie to me.'

1691
01:25:04,739 --> 01:25:07,510
Maxim took my face in his hands.

1692
01:25:07,510 --> 01:25:11,039
'How can I answer you?' he said.

1693
01:25:11,039 --> 01:25:15,670
'If you are happy, then we are both happy.'

1694
01:25:15,670 --> 01:25:17,900
He kissed me and walked across the room.

1695
01:25:17,900 --> 01:25:21,030
'But you are disappointed in me.

1696
01:25:21,030 --> 01:25:23,530
You think I am not right for Manderley.

1697
01:25:23,530 --> 01:25:25,800
If only I hadn't broken that cupid.

1698
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:28,280
Was it very valuable?'

1699
01:25:28,280 --> 01:25:31,130
'I think so,' Maxim answered.

1700
01:25:31,130 --> 01:25:33,949
'It was a wedding present.

1701
01:25:33,949 --> 01:25:37,130
Rebecca knew a lot about china.'

1702
01:25:37,130 --> 01:25:39,639
Maxim went on staring straight in front of
him.

1703
01:25:39,639 --> 01:25:43,060
He is thinking about Rebecca, I said to myself.

1704
01:25:43,060 --> 01:25:47,199
I have broken one of their wedding presents.

1705
01:25:47,199 --> 01:25:49,870
Maxim went back to his chair and picked up
his paper.

1706
01:25:49,870 --> 01:25:53,989
I sat on the long seat under the window.

1707
01:25:53,989 --> 01:26:08,079
After a time, Jasper came to me and climbed
on to my lap.

1708
01:26:08,079 --> 01:26:19,519
CHAPTER TWELVE
In the West Wing

1709
01:26:19,519 --> 01:26:22,159
Maxim had to go up to London at the end of
June.

1710
01:26:22,159 --> 01:26:24,810
It was the first time that I had been left
alone at Manderley.

1711
01:26:24,810 --> 01:26:29,969
I was sure that Maxim would have a terrible
accident or even be killed.

1712
01:26:29,969 --> 01:26:31,699
I was too worried to eat any lunch.

1713
01:26:31,699 --> 01:26:35,920
At about two o'clock, Robert brought me a
message.

1714
01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:38,730
Maxim had arrived safely in London after a
good journey.

1715
01:26:38,730 --> 01:26:43,280
I felt happy again and also rather hungry.

1716
01:26:43,280 --> 01:26:47,239
I went back into the dining-room and took
an apple and some biscuits.

1717
01:26:47,239 --> 01:26:50,760
Then I called Jasper and we went together
into the woods.

1718
01:26:50,760 --> 01:26:54,480
As I sat there I felt happier than I had ever
been at Manderley.

1719
01:26:54,480 --> 01:26:56,510
I could not understand it.

1720
01:26:56,510 --> 01:27:02,210
I had not wanted Maxim to go to London, but
now I was glad to be alone.

1721
01:27:02,210 --> 01:27:04,889
I walked through the Happy Valley to the bay.

1722
01:27:04,889 --> 01:27:06,580
The sea was very calm.

1723
01:27:06,580 --> 01:27:09,809
Jasper ran up the rocks leading to the next
bay.

1724
01:27:09,809 --> 01:27:12,640
'Not that way, Jasper,' I called.

1725
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:14,820
The dog took no notice.

1726
01:27:14,820 --> 01:27:17,090
Oh well, it doesn't matter, I thought.

1727
01:27:17,090 --> 01:27:18,199
Maxim isn't here.

1728
01:27:18,199 --> 01:27:21,369
And I climbed over the rocks after Jasper.

1729
01:27:21,369 --> 01:27:25,699
The tide was out and there was very little
water in the bay.

1730
01:27:25,699 --> 01:27:27,809
The white and green buoy was still there.

1731
01:27:27,809 --> 01:27:32,219
I could read the name on it now: Je Reviens.

1732
01:27:32,219 --> 01:27:36,110
A strange name for a boat - "I'll come back".

1733
01:27:36,110 --> 01:27:40,110
And that boat would never come back now.

1734
01:27:40,110 --> 01:27:43,070
I walked slowly across the beach to the cottage.

1735
01:27:43,070 --> 01:27:47,260
The sun was shining today and the cottage
did not look frightening any more.

1736
01:27:47,260 --> 01:27:48,560
I pushed open the door.

1737
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:50,590
Everything was exactly as before.

1738
01:27:50,590 --> 01:27:55,809
There was a sound in the boat-house and Jasper
ran up to the doorway, barking angrily.

1739
01:27:55,809 --> 01:27:57,280
'Is anybody there?'

1740
01:27:57,280 --> 01:27:58,300
I said.

1741
01:27:58,300 --> 01:28:02,840
I looked through the door and saw Ben sitting
by the wall.

1742
01:28:02,840 --> 01:28:05,289
He looked very frightened.

1743
01:28:05,289 --> 01:28:07,460
'I think you should come out,' I said.

1744
01:28:07,460 --> 01:28:11,340
'Mr de Winter doesn't like people coming in
here.'

1745
01:28:11,340 --> 01:28:15,249
Ben followed me out into the sunshine.

1746
01:28:15,249 --> 01:28:17,880
'I'm not doing anything wrong,' he said.

1747
01:28:17,880 --> 01:28:20,920
'You won't lock me up, will you?'

1748
01:28:20,920 --> 01:28:25,460
His whole body was shaking with fear and tears
were rolling down his fat, round face.

1749
01:28:25,460 --> 01:28:27,650
'I didn't do anything.

1750
01:28:27,650 --> 01:28:29,980
I didn't tell anyone,' he said.

1751
01:28:29,980 --> 01:28:31,699
'That's all right, Ben.

1752
01:28:31,699 --> 01:28:34,170
No one's going to hurt you.

1753
01:28:34,170 --> 01:28:36,749
But don't go into the cottage again.'

1754
01:28:36,749 --> 01:28:38,610
Ben smiled.

1755
01:28:38,610 --> 01:28:42,190
'You're not like the other one,' he said.

1756
01:28:42,190 --> 01:28:44,600
'She was tall and dark.

1757
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:47,250
She had eyes like a snake.

1758
01:28:47,250 --> 01:28:49,590
She came here at night.

1759
01:28:49,590 --> 01:28:52,020
She saw me once, looking at her.

1760
01:28:52,020 --> 01:28:53,739
"You'll be locked up.

1761
01:28:53,739 --> 01:28:56,170
People will hurt you," she said.

1762
01:28:56,170 --> 01:28:59,199
But you won't lock me up, will you?'

1763
01:28:59,199 --> 01:29:02,219
'No, of course not, Ben,' I said.

1764
01:29:02,219 --> 01:29:05,960
Ben smiled again and went off down the beach
to the sea.

1765
01:29:05,960 --> 01:29:08,360
I went up towards the wood.

1766
01:29:08,360 --> 01:29:10,389
Jasper followed me.

1767
01:29:10,389 --> 01:29:11,969
When I looked back, Ben had gone.

1768
01:29:11,969 --> 01:29:16,610
But I had a strange feeling that someone was
watching me.

1769
01:29:16,610 --> 01:29:20,400
Someone tall and dark, who watched and listened.

1770
01:29:20,400 --> 01:29:25,480
I started to run up the path and did not feel
safe until I reached the lawn.

1771
01:29:25,480 --> 01:29:28,820
The house stood there, safe and secure.

1772
01:29:28,820 --> 01:29:31,290
The sun shone on something metal in the drive.

1773
01:29:31,290 --> 01:29:33,560
A green sports car was parked there.

1774
01:29:33,560 --> 01:29:38,380
I had never seen it before and I hoped the
visitor did not want to stay to tea.

1775
01:29:38,380 --> 01:29:42,139
As I walked across the lawn, I looked up at
the west wing.

1776
01:29:42,139 --> 01:29:46,130
One of the shutters was open and a man stood
at the window.

1777
01:29:46,130 --> 01:29:50,179
Then another figure, dressed in black, closed
the shutter.

1778
01:29:50,179 --> 01:29:51,880
I was sure it was Mrs Danvers.

1779
01:29:51,880 --> 01:29:53,409
But who was the man?

1780
01:29:53,409 --> 01:29:58,210
And why had he come when Maxim was away in
London?

1781
01:29:58,210 --> 01:30:01,520
I walked up the steps, through the hall and
into the morning-room.

1782
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:03,440
I could smell cigarette smoke.

1783
01:30:03,440 --> 01:30:07,300
Then I heard voices and, without thinking,
I hid behind the door.

1784
01:30:07,300 --> 01:30:12,300
I heard Mrs Danvers say, 'I expect she went
into the library.

1785
01:30:12,300 --> 01:30:14,630
Wait here while I go and see.'

1786
01:30:14,630 --> 01:30:16,539
She was talking about me of course.

1787
01:30:16,539 --> 01:30:18,120
I did not know what to do.

1788
01:30:18,120 --> 01:30:22,190
Jasper had moved towards the drawing-room,
wagging his tail.

1789
01:30:22,190 --> 01:30:27,719
'Hallo, Jasper, old boy,' said a man's voice
and Jasper ran back into the morning-room.

1790
01:30:27,719 --> 01:30:28,790
The man followed.

1791
01:30:28,790 --> 01:30:31,190
He saw me standing behind the door.

1792
01:30:31,190 --> 01:30:33,929
I have never seen anyone more surprised.

1793
01:30:33,929 --> 01:30:40,039
'I beg your pardon,' the man said, looking
down at me with a rather unpleasant smile.

1794
01:30:40,039 --> 01:30:45,460
He was a big, handsome man, but his face was
red and his eyes were a hard blue.

1795
01:30:45,460 --> 01:30:47,059
His breath smelt of whisky.

1796
01:30:47,059 --> 01:30:49,469
'I'm so sorry,' he said.

1797
01:30:49,469 --> 01:30:51,500
'I called to see Danny.

1798
01:30:51,500 --> 01:30:53,440
She's an old friend of mine.'

1799
01:30:53,440 --> 01:30:55,889
He lit a cigarette and looked round the room.

1800
01:30:55,889 --> 01:30:58,630
'How's old Max?' he asked.

1801
01:30:58,630 --> 01:31:02,309
'Maxim's very well, he's in London,' I said.

1802
01:31:02,309 --> 01:31:03,309
'What?

1803
01:31:03,309 --> 01:31:04,710
He's left you all alone?

1804
01:31:04,710 --> 01:31:07,010
That's not fair, is it?'

1805
01:31:07,010 --> 01:31:09,110
The man gave an unpleasant laugh.

1806
01:31:09,110 --> 01:31:10,869
I did not like him at all.

1807
01:31:10,869 --> 01:31:13,360
At that moment, Mrs Danvers came back.

1808
01:31:13,360 --> 01:31:16,100
She looked at me angrily.

1809
01:31:16,100 --> 01:31:21,400
'Well, Danny,' the man said, 'aren't you going
to introduce me to the new bride?'

1810
01:31:21,400 --> 01:31:25,650
'This is Mr Favell, Madam,' said Mrs Danvers.

1811
01:31:25,650 --> 01:31:27,170
'How do you do?'

1812
01:31:27,170 --> 01:31:28,300
I said politely.

1813
01:31:28,300 --> 01:31:30,719
'Will you stay to tea?'

1814
01:31:30,719 --> 01:31:32,150
The man laughed again.

1815
01:31:32,150 --> 01:31:35,230
'Now isn't that kind, Danny,' he said.

1816
01:31:35,230 --> 01:31:37,030
'But I had better be going.

1817
01:31:37,030 --> 01:31:40,140
Come and look at my car,' he said to me.

1818
01:31:40,140 --> 01:31:41,880
'It's a good car.

1819
01:31:41,880 --> 01:31:44,050
Much faster than the one Max has.'

1820
01:31:44,050 --> 01:31:47,550
I did not like the way that Favell spoke about
Maxim.

1821
01:31:47,550 --> 01:31:49,210
I did not want to look at his car.

1822
01:31:49,210 --> 01:31:51,659
But I followed him out into the hall.

1823
01:31:51,659 --> 01:31:53,300
'Goodbye, Danny.

1824
01:31:53,300 --> 01:31:54,840
Take care of yourself.

1825
01:31:54,840 --> 01:31:57,420
You know my telephone number.'

1826
01:31:57,420 --> 01:32:00,830
'Dear old Manderley,' Favell said as we walked
out of the house.

1827
01:32:00,830 --> 01:32:03,030
'What do you think of it?

1828
01:32:03,030 --> 01:32:04,869
Aren't you lonely living here?'

1829
01:32:04,869 --> 01:32:07,769
'I'm very fond of Manderley,' I said.

1830
01:32:07,769 --> 01:32:12,050
'I have enjoyed meeting you,' Favell said,
standing by his car.

1831
01:32:12,050 --> 01:32:16,230
'But I'd rather you didn't tell Max about
my visit.

1832
01:32:16,230 --> 01:32:18,969
I'm afraid your husband doesn't like me very
much.

1833
01:32:18,969 --> 01:32:23,239
He might be cross with poor old Danny.'

1834
01:32:23,239 --> 01:32:26,840
'No, all right,' I said awkwardly.

1835
01:32:26,840 --> 01:32:29,420
'I won't say anything to Maxim.'

1836
01:32:29,420 --> 01:32:31,590
He got into the car and started the engine.

1837
01:32:31,590 --> 01:32:33,929
'That's very kind,' he said.

1838
01:32:33,929 --> 01:32:37,099
'Perhaps I'll come back and see you one day.

1839
01:32:37,099 --> 01:32:38,099
Goodbye.'

1840
01:32:38,099 --> 01:32:41,349
Favell drove away noisily and much too fast.

1841
01:32:41,349 --> 01:32:43,590
I walked slowly back to the house.

1842
01:32:43,590 --> 01:32:45,869
Mrs Danvers had gone.

1843
01:32:45,869 --> 01:32:47,989
I wondered who Favell was.

1844
01:32:47,989 --> 01:32:50,099
He had certainly been to Manderley before.

1845
01:32:50,099 --> 01:32:53,540
And, like Rebecca, he called Maxim 'Max'.

1846
01:32:53,540 --> 01:32:55,369
Had Favell known Rebecca?

1847
01:32:55,369 --> 01:32:57,900
What had he been doing in the west wing?

1848
01:32:57,900 --> 01:33:01,079
There were some very valuable things in the
house.

1849
01:33:01,079 --> 01:33:03,190
Perhaps the man was a thief.

1850
01:33:03,190 --> 01:33:05,230
I decided to go up to the west wing.

1851
01:33:05,230 --> 01:33:08,090
I must see that everything was all right.

1852
01:33:08,090 --> 01:33:11,469
The house seemed very quiet as I began to
walk up the stairs.

1853
01:33:11,469 --> 01:33:15,230
My heart was beating in a strange, excited
way.

1854
01:33:15,230 --> 01:33:21,050
I was again in the corridor where I had stood
on my first morning at Manderley.

1855
01:33:21,050 --> 01:33:24,380
I turned the handle of the nearest door and
went inside.

1856
01:33:24,380 --> 01:33:26,360
Everything was dark.

1857
01:33:26,360 --> 01:33:28,900
I found the light and switched it on.

1858
01:33:28,900 --> 01:33:32,130
I was surprised to see that the room was completely
furnished.

1859
01:33:32,130 --> 01:33:35,540
There was no dust and everything was clean
and tidy.

1860
01:33:35,540 --> 01:33:40,179
The room, a bedroom, was the most beautiful
I had ever seen.

1861
01:33:40,179 --> 01:33:44,570
There were flowers on the dressing table and
on the table beside the bed.

1862
01:33:44,570 --> 01:33:46,650
A satin dressing-gown lay on a chair.

1863
01:33:46,650 --> 01:33:50,830
There was a pair of slippers under a chair.

1864
01:33:50,830 --> 01:33:53,570
I walked slowly into the middle of the room.

1865
01:33:53,570 --> 01:33:55,989
No, it was not used.

1866
01:33:55,989 --> 01:33:57,560
It was not lived in any more.

1867
01:33:57,560 --> 01:34:00,090
The air was not fresh.

1868
01:34:00,090 --> 01:34:03,249
Rebecca would never come back to this room
again.

1869
01:34:03,249 --> 01:34:06,320
I could hear the sea clearly.

1870
01:34:06,320 --> 01:34:08,809
I went to the window and opened a shutter.

1871
01:34:08,809 --> 01:34:14,940
Yes, I was standing at the window where I
had seen Mrs Danvers and Favell.

1872
01:34:14,940 --> 01:34:17,309
I felt afraid and my legs began to tremble.

1873
01:34:17,309 --> 01:34:20,679
I sat down on the stool by the dressing-table.

1874
01:34:20,679 --> 01:34:24,429
I looked round the room, the most beautiful
in Manderley.

1875
01:34:24,429 --> 01:34:27,760
A room that was never used now.

1876
01:34:27,760 --> 01:34:29,310
I got up and went to the chair.

1877
01:34:29,310 --> 01:34:31,530
I touched the satin dressing-gown.

1878
01:34:31,530 --> 01:34:35,770
I picked up the slippers and held them in
my hand.

1879
01:34:35,770 --> 01:34:37,929
On the bed lay Rebecca's nightdress.

1880
01:34:37,929 --> 01:34:41,640
I went to the bed and held the nightdress
to my face.

1881
01:34:41,640 --> 01:34:45,550
It was cold and smelt of the flowers in the
Happy Valley.

1882
01:34:45,550 --> 01:34:50,420
As I stood looking down at the bed, I heard
a step behind me.

1883
01:34:50,420 --> 01:34:51,969
I turned quickly.

1884
01:34:51,969 --> 01:34:53,260
It was Mrs Danvers.

1885
01:34:53,260 --> 01:34:55,699
I shall never forget the look on her face.

1886
01:34:55,699 --> 01:35:01,010
It was a look of strange, terrible excitement.

1887
01:35:01,010 --> 01:35:04,120
She came nearer and I could feel her breath
on my face.

1888
01:35:04,120 --> 01:35:09,090
'Is there anything the matter, Madam?

1889
01:35:09,090 --> 01:35:10,820
Are you feeling unwell?'

1890
01:35:10,820 --> 01:35:12,559
Mrs Danvers said quietly.

1891
01:35:12,559 --> 01:35:16,670
'I did not expect to see you here, Mrs Danvers.

1892
01:35:16,670 --> 01:35:18,969
I came up to fasten one of the shutters.'

1893
01:35:18,969 --> 01:35:24,179
'I will fasten it,' Mrs Danvers said.

1894
01:35:24,179 --> 01:35:26,989
Mrs Danvers came back from the window and
stood beside me.

1895
01:35:26,989 --> 01:35:30,610
'You opened the shutter yourself, didn't you?'

1896
01:35:30,610 --> 01:35:31,610
she said.

1897
01:35:31,610 --> 01:35:35,039
'You wanted to see this room, didn't you?

1898
01:35:35,039 --> 01:35:37,730
Now you are here, let me show you everything.'

1899
01:35:37,730 --> 01:35:42,059
Her voice now was as soft and sweet as honey.

1900
01:35:42,059 --> 01:35:45,360
'It's a lovely room, isn't it?

1901
01:35:45,360 --> 01:35:46,610
That was her bed.

1902
01:35:46,610 --> 01:35:49,550
I keep it just as it was.

1903
01:35:49,550 --> 01:35:51,210
This was her nightdress.

1904
01:35:51,210 --> 01:35:53,929
She was wearing it the night before she died.

1905
01:35:53,929 --> 01:35:56,619
These are her slippers.'

1906
01:35:56,619 --> 01:36:01,369
Mrs Danvers put the slippers back under the
chair and walked across the room to a large

1907
01:36:01,369 --> 01:36:02,369
wardrobe.

1908
01:36:02,369 --> 01:36:05,090
'All her evening clothes are here.

1909
01:36:05,090 --> 01:36:06,690
Her furs, too.

1910
01:36:06,690 --> 01:36:12,369
Mr de Winter was always buying clothes for
her, beautiful clothes.'

1911
01:36:12,369 --> 01:36:15,499
Mrs Danvers held my arm tightly with her long
thin fingers.

1912
01:36:15,499 --> 01:36:18,460
Her eyes looked deep into mine.

1913
01:36:18,460 --> 01:36:22,949
'I blame myself for the accident,' she said.

1914
01:36:22,949 --> 01:36:25,030
'I was out that evening.

1915
01:36:25,030 --> 01:36:28,719
When I came in, I heard she had gone down
to the bay.

1916
01:36:28,719 --> 01:36:30,550
I was worried.

1917
01:36:30,550 --> 01:36:32,889
The wind was blowing hard.

1918
01:36:32,889 --> 01:36:36,150
Mr de Winter came in at about eleven.

1919
01:36:36,150 --> 01:36:39,520
The wind was blowing harder, and still she
had not come back.

1920
01:36:39,520 --> 01:36:42,869
'I sat on my bed until after five.

1921
01:36:42,869 --> 01:36:46,050
Then I put on my coat and went down to the
bay.

1922
01:36:46,050 --> 01:36:48,880
I saw at once that the boat had gone.'

1923
01:36:48,880 --> 01:36:51,969
Mrs Danvers' hand fell back to her side.

1924
01:36:51,969 --> 01:36:55,679
'That is why Mr de Winter doesn't use these
rooms any more.

1925
01:36:55,679 --> 01:36:57,869
Listen to the sea.'

1926
01:36:57,869 --> 01:37:03,210
Even with the shutters and windows closed,
I could hear the dull, harsh sound of the

1927
01:37:03,210 --> 01:37:04,780
sea in the bay.

1928
01:37:04,780 --> 01:37:10,020
'I come into these room and dust them every
day,' Mrs Danvers said.

1929
01:37:10,020 --> 01:37:13,010
'If you want to come again, ask me.

1930
01:37:13,010 --> 01:37:15,849
No one comes here but me.

1931
01:37:15,849 --> 01:37:19,619
'Sometimes I feel she is standing here, behind
me.

1932
01:37:19,619 --> 01:37:22,130
I feel her everywhere.

1933
01:37:22,130 --> 01:37:23,920
In the morning-room and in the hall.

1934
01:37:23,920 --> 01:37:28,070
You feel her too, don't you?'

1935
01:37:28,070 --> 01:37:32,679
I tried to smile, but I felt sick and ill.

1936
01:37:32,679 --> 01:37:35,800
'Do you think she can see us now?'

1937
01:37:35,800 --> 01:37:37,670
Mrs Danvers asked me.

1938
01:37:37,670 --> 01:37:42,849
'Do you think the dead watch the living?'

1939
01:37:42,849 --> 01:37:47,090
'I don't know,' I said.

1940
01:37:47,090 --> 01:37:48,090
'I don't know.'

1941
01:37:48,090 --> 01:37:54,960
'Sometimes I think she watches you and Mr
de Winter together,' Mrs Danvers whispered.

1942
01:37:54,960 --> 01:37:56,570
We stood there by the door, staring at one
another.

1943
01:37:56,570 --> 01:38:00,600
I could not take my eyes away from hers.

1944
01:38:00,600 --> 01:38:03,949
Then I turned and walked into the corridor.

1945
01:38:03,949 --> 01:38:06,659
I went down the stairs and through the door
to the east wing.

1946
01:38:06,659 --> 01:38:09,170
I pushed open the door to my own bedroom.

1947
01:38:09,170 --> 01:38:12,050
I shut the door of the room and locked it.

1948
01:38:12,050 --> 01:38:18,210
Then I lay down on my bed and closed my eyes.

1949
01:38:18,210 --> 01:38:33,920
I felt terribly sick.

1950
01:38:33,920 --> 01:38:39,199
CHAPTER THIRTEEN
More About Jack Favell

1951
01:38:39,199 --> 01:38:40,920
Maxim rang up the next morning.

1952
01:38:40,920 --> 01:38:44,999
I heard the phone ring while I was having
breakfast and Frith answered it.

1953
01:38:44,999 --> 01:38:48,260
I hoped that Maxim would ask for me but he
did not.

1954
01:38:48,260 --> 01:38:53,960
'Mr de Winter will be back at about six this
evening,' Frith told me.

1955
01:38:53,960 --> 01:38:55,280
'All right, Frith.

1956
01:38:55,280 --> 01:38:57,060
Thank you,' I said.

1957
01:38:57,060 --> 01:38:59,909
I went on eating breakfast as slowly as I
could.

1958
01:38:59,909 --> 01:39:02,639
Jasper was sitting at my feet.

1959
01:39:02,639 --> 01:39:05,579
I wondered what I should do all day.

1960
01:39:05,579 --> 01:39:06,789
I had slept badly.

1961
01:39:06,789 --> 01:39:09,969
I could not forget my visit to the west wing.

1962
01:39:09,969 --> 01:39:12,820
I knew now how much Mrs Danvers hated me.

1963
01:39:12,820 --> 01:39:16,300
About ten o'clock, the telephone rang again.

1964
01:39:16,300 --> 01:39:18,270
This time it was Beatrice.

1965
01:39:18,270 --> 01:39:20,639
'Well, my dear, how are you?'

1966
01:39:20,639 --> 01:39:21,639
she said.

1967
01:39:21,639 --> 01:39:24,260
'Shall I come and have lunch with you today?'

1968
01:39:24,260 --> 01:39:27,510
'I'd like you to come very much, Beatrice,'
I said.

1969
01:39:27,510 --> 01:39:29,590
'All right, my dear.

1970
01:39:29,590 --> 01:39:31,150
See you later.'

1971
01:39:31,150 --> 01:39:32,749
I put the phone down.

1972
01:39:32,749 --> 01:39:34,249
I was glad that Beatrice was coming.

1973
01:39:34,249 --> 01:39:36,960
It gave me something to look forward to.

1974
01:39:36,960 --> 01:39:38,969
I wandered out on to the lawn.

1975
01:39:38,969 --> 01:39:41,809
I felt different from yesterday.

1976
01:39:41,809 --> 01:39:43,860
I wanted Maxim to come home.

1977
01:39:43,860 --> 01:39:46,929
I tried not to remember my visit to the west
wing.

1978
01:39:46,929 --> 01:39:51,360
But I could not stop thinking about Favell
and his friendship with Mrs Danvers.

1979
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:54,460
I began to feel that Mrs Danvers was watching
me.

1980
01:39:54,460 --> 01:39:57,960
There were so many rooms that Maxim and I
never used.

1981
01:39:57,960 --> 01:40:03,199
It was easy for Mrs Danvers to watch me from
one of their windows.

1982
01:40:03,199 --> 01:40:05,679
Beatrice arrived by car at about half past
twelve.

1983
01:40:05,679 --> 01:40:08,320
This time I went out to the drive to meet
her.

1984
01:40:08,320 --> 01:40:11,699
'Well, my dear, here I am,' she said.

1985
01:40:11,699 --> 01:40:14,239
'It's a lovely day, isn't it?'

1986
01:40:14,239 --> 01:40:16,329
She gave me a kiss and then looked at me carefully.

1987
01:40:16,329 --> 01:40:18,869
'You don't look well,' Beatrice said.

1988
01:40:18,869 --> 01:40:20,989
'You are much too thin.

1989
01:40:20,989 --> 01:40:22,780
Your face is pale, too.

1990
01:40:22,780 --> 01:40:24,309
What's wrong with you?'

1991
01:40:24,309 --> 01:40:25,590
'Nothing,' I said.

1992
01:40:25,590 --> 01:40:27,639
'My face is always pale.'

1993
01:40:27,639 --> 01:40:31,739
'You looked quite different when I saw you
before,' Beatrice told me.

1994
01:40:31,739 --> 01:40:34,499
'You are not going to have a baby, are you?'

1995
01:40:34,499 --> 01:40:37,019
'No, I don't think so,' I said.

1996
01:40:37,019 --> 01:40:39,599
'Well, I hope you will sometime.

1997
01:40:39,599 --> 01:40:41,039
Maxim would be so happy to have a son.

1998
01:40:41,039 --> 01:40:43,159
What have you been doing with yourself?

1999
01:40:43,159 --> 01:40:44,539
Have you done much sketching?

2000
01:40:44,539 --> 01:40:46,341
Did you like the books I sent you?

2001
01:40:46,341 --> 01:40:47,341
Have you had anyone to stay?'

2002
01:40:47,341 --> 01:40:52,650
I had forgotten that Beatrice asked so many
questions.

2003
01:40:52,650 --> 01:40:55,539
'No, we've had no one to stay.

2004
01:40:55,539 --> 01:40:58,619
People come to tea sometimes, of course.'

2005
01:40:58,619 --> 01:41:02,199
I wondered whether to tell Beatrice about
Mrs Danvers' visitor, Favell.

2006
01:41:02,199 --> 01:41:05,110
I did not want Beatrice to tell Maxim about
the visit.

2007
01:41:05,110 --> 01:41:08,119
But I did want to find out more about the
man.

2008
01:41:08,119 --> 01:41:11,829
'Have you ever heard of a man called Jack
Favell, Beatrice?'

2009
01:41:11,829 --> 01:41:13,510
I asked her.

2010
01:41:13,510 --> 01:41:16,300
'Jack Favell?' said Beatrice slowly.

2011
01:41:16,300 --> 01:41:19,519
'Yes, I do know the name.

2012
01:41:19,519 --> 01:41:22,210
Wait a minute - Jack Favell.

2013
01:41:22,210 --> 01:41:23,729
Yes, of course.

2014
01:41:23,729 --> 01:41:24,869
I remember him now.

2015
01:41:24,869 --> 01:41:26,369
He's an awful man.

2016
01:41:26,369 --> 01:41:28,630
I met him once, years ago.'

2017
01:41:28,630 --> 01:41:31,260
'He was here yesterday,' I told her.

2018
01:41:31,260 --> 01:41:34,239
'He came to see Mrs Danvers.'

2019
01:41:34,239 --> 01:41:35,530
Beatrice did not look at me.

2020
01:41:35,530 --> 01:41:40,219
'Oh well,' she said, 'I suppose he knows Mrs
Danvers quite well.'

2021
01:41:40,219 --> 01:41:41,340
'But why?'

2022
01:41:41,340 --> 01:41:42,340
I asked.

2023
01:41:42,340 --> 01:41:46,170
'Jack Favell is Rebecca's cousin,' Beatrice
said.

2024
01:41:46,170 --> 01:41:49,400
'I think he came to Manderley quite a lot
when Rebecca was alive.

2025
01:41:49,400 --> 01:41:51,039
I'm not sure.'

2026
01:41:51,039 --> 01:41:54,019
'I did not like him,' I said.

2027
01:41:54,019 --> 01:41:57,860
'No, I don't suppose that you did,' Beatrice
answered.

2028
01:41:57,860 --> 01:42:01,979
I hoped that she would tell me more about
Favell, but she did not.

2029
01:42:01,979 --> 01:42:05,190
For the rest of the time we talked about other
things.

2030
01:42:05,190 --> 01:42:07,789
Beatrice stayed for tea and left soon afterwards.

2031
01:42:07,789 --> 01:42:11,059
She had promised to meet her husband, Giles,
at the station.

2032
01:42:11,059 --> 01:42:17,480
'I hope you won't be so thin next time I see
you,' Beatrice said as she got into her car.

2033
01:42:17,480 --> 01:42:18,619
'Give Maxim my love.

2034
01:42:18,619 --> 01:42:22,830
Look after him, and look after yourself, too.'

2035
01:42:22,830 --> 01:42:26,040
I watched Beatrice's car go down the drive.

2036
01:42:26,040 --> 01:42:28,179
Maxim would not be back for another hour.

2037
01:42:28,179 --> 01:42:30,400
I did not feel like sitting in the house by
myself.

2038
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:33,760
I called Jasper and we went for a walk through
the woods.

2039
01:42:33,760 --> 01:42:35,890
But I did not go near the sea.

2040
01:42:35,890 --> 01:42:39,690
I missed Maxim now and felt lonely without
him.

2041
01:42:39,690 --> 01:42:43,499
Beatrice's questions had made me feel tired
too.

2042
01:42:43,499 --> 01:42:46,870
When I came back from my walk, I saw Maxim's
car standing in front of the house.

2043
01:42:46,870 --> 01:42:49,989
At once, I felt much happier.

2044
01:42:49,989 --> 01:42:53,280
I ran quickly up the steps and into the hall.

2045
01:42:53,280 --> 01:42:56,489
As I walked towards the library, I heard the
sound of voices.

2046
01:42:56,489 --> 01:43:01,110
One voice was Maxim's, very loud and angry.

2047
01:43:01,110 --> 01:43:03,199
The door was shut, but I could hear what he
said.

2048
01:43:03,199 --> 01:43:05,849
'You can tell Favell to keep away from Manderley.

2049
01:43:05,849 --> 01:43:08,730
Tell him I said so,' Maxim was saying.

2050
01:43:08,730 --> 01:43:10,690
'I know he was here.

2051
01:43:10,690 --> 01:43:11,829
Never mind who told me.

2052
01:43:11,829 --> 01:43:13,489
His car was seen here yesterday.

2053
01:43:13,489 --> 01:43:16,590
If you want to meet him, meet him somewhere
else.

2054
01:43:16,590 --> 01:43:18,499
I don't want that man at Manderley.

2055
01:43:18,499 --> 01:43:20,150
I won't even have him in the gardens.

2056
01:43:20,150 --> 01:43:23,199
I'm telling you for the last time.'

2057
01:43:23,199 --> 01:43:24,199
I heard footsteps.

2058
01:43:24,199 --> 01:43:27,260
I ran quickly up the stairs and hid myself.

2059
01:43:27,260 --> 01:43:29,639
Mrs Danvers came out of the library.

2060
01:43:29,639 --> 01:43:31,780
She shut the door and walked up the stairs.

2061
01:43:31,780 --> 01:43:35,989
Her face was grey with anger and the look
in her eyes frightened me.

2062
01:43:35,989 --> 01:43:39,260
Thank God she did not know I was watching
her.

2063
01:43:39,260 --> 01:43:41,829
Mrs Danvers went through the door to the west
wing.

2064
01:43:41,829 --> 01:43:46,820
I waited a moment and then went downstairs
and into the library.

2065
01:43:46,820 --> 01:43:48,070
Maxim was standing by the window.

2066
01:43:48,070 --> 01:43:51,749
When he heard the door open, he turned round
quickly.

2067
01:43:51,749 --> 01:43:54,239
I smiled and held out my hand to him.

2068
01:43:54,239 --> 01:43:56,389
'Oh, it's you,' Maxim said.

2069
01:43:56,389 --> 01:43:58,969
I could tell that he was very angry.

2070
01:43:58,969 --> 01:44:01,060
His face was white and his mouth hard.

2071
01:44:01,060 --> 01:44:02,940
I took his hand in mine.

2072
01:44:02,940 --> 01:44:05,360
'I missed you so much,' I said.

2073
01:44:05,360 --> 01:44:07,369
'I hate being here without you.'

2074
01:44:07,369 --> 01:44:09,050
'Do you?'

2075
01:44:09,050 --> 01:44:10,050
Maxim said.

2076
01:44:10,050 --> 01:44:12,860
He did not say anything about Mrs Danvers
or Favell.

2077
01:44:12,860 --> 01:44:14,389
'Are you worried about something?'

2078
01:44:14,389 --> 01:44:16,380
I asked.

2079
01:44:16,380 --> 01:44:20,170
'I've had a long day,' Maxim answered.

2080
01:44:20,170 --> 01:44:22,369
'And London was very hot and noisy.

2081
01:44:22,369 --> 01:44:25,690
I always hate going there.'

2082
01:44:25,690 --> 01:44:28,639
Maxim lit a cigarette and moved away from
me.

2083
01:44:28,639 --> 01:44:33,260
I knew then that he was not going to tell
me about his anger with Mrs Danvers.

2084
01:44:33,260 --> 01:44:37,619
Maxim still thought of me as a child - someone
who must not hear unpleasant things.

2085
01:44:37,619 --> 01:44:39,030
But he was wrong.

2086
01:44:39,030 --> 01:44:43,010
I felt I was growing up a little more every
day.

2087
01:44:43,010 --> 01:44:48,949
My life at Manderley was turning me into a
woman.

2088
01:44:48,949 --> 01:44:57,659
CHAPTER FOURTEEN
Preparations for the Ball

2089
01:44:57,659 --> 01:45:05,500
It was on a Sunday afternoon when someone
spoke about the Fancy Dress Ball again.

2090
01:45:05,500 --> 01:45:09,630
Frank Crawley had come to lunch and the three
of us were hoping to have a quiet afternoon.

2091
01:45:09,630 --> 01:45:13,565
But as we were walking out to the big tree
on the lawn, we heard a car in the drive.

2092
01:45:13,565 --> 01:45:18,610
We had to go back into the house to welcome
the visitors.

2093
01:45:18,610 --> 01:45:22,510
Very soon, more people arrived and then some
more.

2094
01:45:22,510 --> 01:45:25,969
They all stayed to tea, of course.

2095
01:45:25,969 --> 01:45:29,969
As we sat in the drawing-room eating cake
and sandwiches, one of our visitors suddenly

2096
01:45:29,969 --> 01:45:33,229
said to Maxim, 'Oh, Mr de Winter.

2097
01:45:33,229 --> 01:45:34,381
There is something I must ask you.

2098
01:45:34,381 --> 01:45:39,249
Are you having a Fancy Dress Ball at Manderley
this year?'

2099
01:45:39,249 --> 01:45:40,500
Maxim answered quietly.

2100
01:45:40,500 --> 01:45:43,540
'I haven't thought about it,' he said.

2101
01:45:43,540 --> 01:45:45,869
'And I don't think anyone else has, either.'

2102
01:45:45,869 --> 01:45:48,710
'Oh, but you are wrong,' said another woman.

2103
01:45:48,710 --> 01:45:51,210
'We have all been thinking about it.

2104
01:45:51,210 --> 01:45:54,420
We used to enjoy the Manderley Ball so much.'

2105
01:45:54,420 --> 01:45:56,559
'Well, I don't know,' said Maxim.

2106
01:45:56,559 --> 01:45:59,650
'There would be a great deal to do.

2107
01:45:59,650 --> 01:46:01,980
You had better ask Frank Crawley.

2108
01:46:01,980 --> 01:46:03,940
He would do most of the work.'

2109
01:46:03,940 --> 01:46:08,949
'I don't mind the work,' said Frank, looking
at me.

2110
01:46:08,949 --> 01:46:12,979
'It's for Maxim and Mrs de Winter to decide.'

2111
01:46:12,979 --> 01:46:15,639
Everyone looked at me and started to talk
at once.

2112
01:46:15,639 --> 01:46:17,979
'Now, Mrs de Winter, you must help us.

2113
01:46:17,979 --> 01:46:20,389
Your husband will listen to you.

2114
01:46:20,389 --> 01:46:22,099
After all, you are a new bride.

2115
01:46:22,099 --> 01:46:23,770
The Ball will be for you.'

2116
01:46:23,770 --> 01:46:27,619
'Yes, of course,' said a man, 'we all missed
your wedding.

2117
01:46:27,619 --> 01:46:31,680
There ought to be some kind of party here
at Manderley.'

2118
01:46:31,680 --> 01:46:34,920
Everyone laughed and clapped their hands.

2119
01:46:34,920 --> 01:46:36,190
Maxim looked at me.

2120
01:46:36,190 --> 01:46:38,130
'What about you?

2121
01:46:38,130 --> 01:46:39,889
Would you like it?' he said.

2122
01:46:39,889 --> 01:46:42,999
I did not know what Maxim was thinking.

2123
01:46:42,999 --> 01:46:46,320
Perhaps he thought I was too shy to want the
Ball.

2124
01:46:46,320 --> 01:46:51,519
'I think I rather like the idea,' I said with
a smile.

2125
01:46:51,519 --> 01:46:52,519
Maxim turned away.

2126
01:46:52,519 --> 01:46:54,130
'All right, then, Frank.

2127
01:46:54,130 --> 01:46:56,369
We'll have the dance.

2128
01:46:56,369 --> 01:46:57,719
Mrs Danvers can help you.

2129
01:46:57,719 --> 01:46:59,219
She will know what to do.

2130
01:46:59,219 --> 01:47:03,719
Now, if we've all finished tea, we'll go into
the garden.'

2131
01:47:03,719 --> 01:47:05,739
We all went outside.

2132
01:47:05,739 --> 01:47:10,360
Our visitors were talking happily now about
their costumes for the Ball.

2133
01:47:10,360 --> 01:47:11,979
I felt excited too.

2134
01:47:11,979 --> 01:47:14,110
'What will you wear?'

2135
01:47:14,110 --> 01:47:15,229
I said to Maxim.

2136
01:47:15,229 --> 01:47:18,389
'I never wear fancy dress,' Maxim replied.

2137
01:47:18,389 --> 01:47:21,710
'I'm the host, so I can do as I like.'

2138
01:47:21,710 --> 01:47:23,590
'What shall I wear?'

2139
01:47:23,590 --> 01:47:24,590
I said.

2140
01:47:24,590 --> 01:47:27,170
'I've no idea at all.'

2141
01:47:27,170 --> 01:47:28,330
Maxim smiled at me.

2142
01:47:28,330 --> 01:47:32,499
'If you look pretty, I don't mind what you
put on,' he told me.

2143
01:47:32,499 --> 01:47:34,340
'All right,' I said.

2144
01:47:34,340 --> 01:47:36,219
'My costume will be a secret.

2145
01:47:36,219 --> 01:47:39,289
I shall keep it as a surprise.'

2146
01:47:39,289 --> 01:47:42,290
Maxim laughed and patted me on the shoulder.

2147
01:47:42,290 --> 01:47:45,280
As usual, he was treating me like a child.

2148
01:47:45,280 --> 01:47:47,400
I did not want to be a child.

2149
01:47:47,400 --> 01:47:49,289
I wanted to be a grown-up woman.

2150
01:47:49,289 --> 01:47:53,710
I shall wear a beautiful dress at the Ball,
I told myself.

2151
01:47:53,710 --> 01:47:56,079
Everyone will say how charming I am.

2152
01:47:56,079 --> 01:48:00,800
They will think of me as the real Mrs de Winter
at last.

2153
01:48:00,800 --> 01:48:06,949
Maxim will love me as his wife and forget
about Rebecca.

2154
01:48:06,949 --> 01:48:09,749
Soon everyone at Manderley was talking about
the Fancy Dress Ball.

2155
01:48:09,749 --> 01:48:13,800
My little maid, Clarice, spoke of nothing
else.

2156
01:48:13,800 --> 01:48:16,789
'Oh, Madam, it's so exciting,' she said.

2157
01:48:16,789 --> 01:48:19,369
'I'm looking forward to it so much.'

2158
01:48:19,369 --> 01:48:22,369
The preparations went on.

2159
01:48:22,369 --> 01:48:24,650
Frank was very busy and so was Mrs Danvers.

2160
01:48:24,650 --> 01:48:27,599
I saw very little of her, and I was glad.

2161
01:48:27,599 --> 01:48:31,219
I began to get worried about my costume.

2162
01:48:31,219 --> 01:48:32,999
I did not know what to wear.

2163
01:48:32,999 --> 01:48:35,960
I looked through the books that Beatrice had
given me.

2164
01:48:35,960 --> 01:48:40,270
I made sketches of some of the costumes, but
I did not like any of them.

2165
01:48:40,270 --> 01:48:43,729
I wanted something that was pretty and simple
too.

2166
01:48:43,729 --> 01:48:48,849
That evening, as I was getting ready for dinner,
there was a knock at my bedroom door.

2167
01:48:48,849 --> 01:48:51,809
To my surprise, it was Mrs Danvers.

2168
01:48:51,809 --> 01:48:54,250
She was holding a piece of paper in her hand.

2169
01:48:54,250 --> 01:48:59,070
It was a drawing of a costume which I had
sketched and then thrown away.

2170
01:48:59,070 --> 01:49:02,570
'I found this, Madam,' Mrs Danvers said.

2171
01:49:02,570 --> 01:49:06,070
'I thought you had thrown it away by mistake.'

2172
01:49:06,070 --> 01:49:11,309
'No, Mrs Danvers, I don't want it, thank you,'
I said quickly.

2173
01:49:11,309 --> 01:49:14,210
I hoped she would go, but she stood at the
door.

2174
01:49:14,210 --> 01:49:20,409
'So you haven't decided what to wear, Madam,'
Mrs Danvers said in a friendly voice.

2175
01:49:20,409 --> 01:49:24,579
'No, I haven't decided yet,' I replied.

2176
01:49:24,579 --> 01:49:29,030
'Perhaps you could copy one of the pictures
in the gallery,' Mrs Danvers suggested.

2177
01:49:29,030 --> 01:49:32,239
'Many of them would make beautiful costumes.

2178
01:49:32,239 --> 01:49:34,889
What does Mr de Winter think?'

2179
01:49:34,889 --> 01:49:37,680
'I don't know,' I said.

2180
01:49:37,680 --> 01:49:39,209
'I wanted to surprise him.

2181
01:49:39,209 --> 01:49:42,619
I was going to keep my costume a secret.'

2182
01:49:42,619 --> 01:49:45,320
Mrs Danvers looked pleased at my words.

2183
01:49:45,320 --> 01:49:50,370
'Then I suggest that you have your costume
made in London, Madam.

2184
01:49:50,370 --> 01:49:53,460
There is a shop in Bond Street that would
do it really well.

2185
01:49:53,460 --> 01:49:58,940
I have always liked the picture of the girl
in white,' Mrs Danvers went on in the same

2186
01:49:58,940 --> 01:50:00,079
friendly way.

2187
01:50:00,079 --> 01:50:03,949
'The picture is about two hundred years old.

2188
01:50:03,949 --> 01:50:06,320
The girl's wearing a very simple dress.

2189
01:50:06,320 --> 01:50:09,539
It would be easy to copy.'

2190
01:50:09,539 --> 01:50:11,590
I did not know what to say.

2191
01:50:11,590 --> 01:50:13,199
I knew the picture well.

2192
01:50:13,199 --> 01:50:15,739
I wished I had thought of the idea myself.

2193
01:50:15,739 --> 01:50:19,449
'Thank you, Mrs Danvers,' I said.

2194
01:50:19,449 --> 01:50:22,650
Mrs Danvers went out quietly.

2195
01:50:22,650 --> 01:50:25,199
I wondered why she was so friendly.

2196
01:50:25,199 --> 01:50:28,510
Perhaps Maxim's anger had frightened her a
little.

2197
01:50:28,510 --> 01:50:32,349
As I went down to dinner, I stopped in front
of the picture of the young girl.

2198
01:50:32,349 --> 01:50:37,110
Her name was Caroline de Winter and she had
been famous for her beauty.

2199
01:50:37,110 --> 01:50:42,380
The dress was very simple, with short sleeves
and a long, full skirt.

2200
01:50:42,380 --> 01:50:44,760
Her hair was in curls.

2201
01:50:44,760 --> 01:50:47,389
I would have to wear a wig over my own straight
hair.

2202
01:50:47,389 --> 01:50:49,900
I felt very excited.

2203
01:50:49,900 --> 01:50:52,280
I was glad that I had chosen my costume at
last.

2204
01:50:52,280 --> 01:50:55,270
I said nothing to Maxim.

2205
01:50:55,270 --> 01:50:57,289
The next day I made a sketch of the picture.

2206
01:50:57,289 --> 01:51:01,300
Then I sent the drawing to the shop in London
with careful instructions about the dress

2207
01:51:01,300 --> 01:51:02,349
and the wig.

2208
01:51:02,349 --> 01:51:05,790
The preparations for the great day went on.

2209
01:51:05,790 --> 01:51:08,550
No one expected me to do anything.

2210
01:51:08,550 --> 01:51:12,340
Slowly, the great house began to change.

2211
01:51:12,340 --> 01:51:15,070
Furniture was moved as the great hall was
prepared for dancing.

2212
01:51:15,070 --> 01:51:18,469
Coloured lights were hung in the trees outside.

2213
01:51:18,469 --> 01:51:19,540
There were flowers everywhere.

2214
01:51:19,540 --> 01:51:24,489
Hundreds of them were brought in from the
garden and Mrs Danvers knew exactly how to

2215
01:51:24,489 --> 01:51:26,219
arrange them.

2216
01:51:26,219 --> 01:51:28,110
Manderley took on a new beauty.

2217
01:51:28,110 --> 01:51:41,260
I had never seen the old house looking so
lovely.

2218
01:51:41,260 --> 01:51:44,010
CHAPTER FIFTEEN
Miss Caroline de Winter

2219
01:51:44,010 --> 01:51:48,489
On the day of the Ball, Maxim and I had lunch
with Frank.

2220
01:51:48,489 --> 01:51:53,139
My dress and the wig had arrived and they
both looked perfect.

2221
01:51:53,139 --> 01:51:57,010
Maxim and Frank asked me about my costume
but I told them nothing.

2222
01:51:57,010 --> 01:51:59,329
The secret made me feel excited and important.

2223
01:51:59,329 --> 01:52:02,090
'You won't know it's me,' I told them.

2224
01:52:02,090 --> 01:52:05,889
'You will both have the surprise of your lives.'

2225
01:52:05,889 --> 01:52:08,739
Maxim and I went back to the house after lunch.

2226
01:52:08,739 --> 01:52:11,599
The band had arrived and we welcomed the men.

2227
01:52:11,599 --> 01:52:13,980
The afternoon seemed very long.

2228
01:52:13,980 --> 01:52:16,099
I thought about going for a walk.

2229
01:52:16,099 --> 01:52:20,900
Then suddenly, it was tea-time and Beatrice
and her husband, Giles, had arrived.

2230
01:52:20,900 --> 01:52:25,590
'This is like old times,' said Beatrice, looking
around.

2231
01:52:25,590 --> 01:52:27,699
'Everything is as beautiful as ever.

2232
01:52:27,699 --> 01:52:28,699
What's everyone going to wear?

2233
01:52:28,699 --> 01:52:32,619
I suppose you refuse to wear fancy dress,
Maxim?'

2234
01:52:32,619 --> 01:52:34,539
'Of course,' Maxim said.

2235
01:52:34,539 --> 01:52:36,610
'I prefer to be comfortable.'

2236
01:52:36,610 --> 01:52:38,989
'I'm going to dress as an Arab,' said Giles.

2237
01:52:38,989 --> 01:52:41,999
'I got the idea from a friend.'

2238
01:52:41,999 --> 01:52:43,520
'What about you, Mrs Lacy?'

2239
01:52:43,520 --> 01:52:45,849
Frank said to Beatrice.

2240
01:52:45,849 --> 01:52:47,179
'I'm in Eastern dress, too.

2241
01:52:47,179 --> 01:52:49,619
I'm wearing a veil and lots of jewellery.

2242
01:52:49,619 --> 01:52:51,480
I'll be cool and comfortable.

2243
01:52:51,480 --> 01:52:52,809
That's all that matters.'

2244
01:52:52,809 --> 01:52:53,969
Beatrice turned to me.

2245
01:52:53,969 --> 01:52:56,969
'And what is our hostess going to wear?'

2246
01:52:56,969 --> 01:52:57,969
she asked.

2247
01:52:57,969 --> 01:53:00,090
'The Ball is for you, after all.

2248
01:53:00,090 --> 01:53:02,929
We all expect you to wear something really
special.'

2249
01:53:02,929 --> 01:53:04,749
'Don't ask her,' said Maxim.

2250
01:53:04,749 --> 01:53:06,210
'She won't tell anyone.

2251
01:53:06,210 --> 01:53:08,560
She's had the dress made in London.'

2252
01:53:08,560 --> 01:53:11,030
'It's quite simple really,' I said.

2253
01:53:11,030 --> 01:53:13,969
'What fun it all is,' said Beatrice.

2254
01:53:13,969 --> 01:53:16,479
'I'm getting excited already.'

2255
01:53:16,479 --> 01:53:21,090
'You've got her to thank for it,' said Maxim,
smiling at me.

2256
01:53:21,090 --> 01:53:22,360
Everyone looked at me and smiled.

2257
01:53:22,360 --> 01:53:24,230
I felt pleased and happy.

2258
01:53:24,230 --> 01:53:30,940
This Ball was for me because I was a bride,
the new Mrs de Winter.

2259
01:53:30,940 --> 01:53:34,820
Manderley had been made into a place of light
and beauty, just for me.

2260
01:53:34,820 --> 01:53:37,550
'What's the time?'

2261
01:53:37,550 --> 01:53:38,550
I said.

2262
01:53:38,550 --> 01:53:40,370
'I think we ought to be getting ready.'

2263
01:53:40,370 --> 01:53:43,940
I found Clarice waiting for me in my bedroom,
her face full of excitement.

2264
01:53:43,940 --> 01:53:47,449
I locked the door and took the dress from
its box.

2265
01:53:47,449 --> 01:53:50,270
It fitted perfectly.

2266
01:53:50,270 --> 01:53:51,710
I looked at myself in the mirror.

2267
01:53:51,710 --> 01:53:53,179
I smiled.

2268
01:53:53,179 --> 01:53:54,869
I felt different already.

2269
01:53:54,869 --> 01:53:58,130
I was someone more exciting and interesting
than my usual self.

2270
01:53:58,130 --> 01:54:00,929
'Give me the wig, Clarice,' I said.

2271
01:54:00,929 --> 01:54:02,820
'Be careful, the curls mustn't be flat.'

2272
01:54:02,820 --> 01:54:06,530
I brushed back my own straight hair.

2273
01:54:06,530 --> 01:54:09,739
Carefully, I put the wig in place.

2274
01:54:09,739 --> 01:54:11,599
I looked in the mirror again.

2275
01:54:11,599 --> 01:54:16,059
The wig and the tightly fitting dress made
me almost beautiful.

2276
01:54:16,059 --> 01:54:17,979
'Oh, Clarice,' I said.

2277
01:54:17,979 --> 01:54:20,729
'What will Mr de Winter say?'

2278
01:54:20,729 --> 01:54:23,039
There was a knock on the door.

2279
01:54:23,039 --> 01:54:24,709
'Who's there?'

2280
01:54:24,709 --> 01:54:25,709
I called.

2281
01:54:25,709 --> 01:54:26,729
'You can't come in.'

2282
01:54:26,729 --> 01:54:29,170
'It's me, my dear,' said Beatrice.

2283
01:54:29,170 --> 01:54:30,479
'Are you ready?

2284
01:54:30,479 --> 01:54:32,199
I want to have a look at you.'

2285
01:54:32,199 --> 01:54:36,329
'No, no,' I said, 'you can't come in.

2286
01:54:36,329 --> 01:54:38,320
Tell Maxim that he can't come in either.

2287
01:54:38,320 --> 01:54:41,429
I'll come down when I'm ready.'

2288
01:54:41,429 --> 01:54:43,249
I looked in the mirror again.

2289
01:54:43,249 --> 01:54:47,969
My eyes looked larger and the curls made a
soft cloud round my head.

2290
01:54:47,969 --> 01:54:50,969
I lifted the skirt of the dress in my hands.

2291
01:54:50,969 --> 01:54:53,999
'Unlock the door,' I said to Clarice.

2292
01:54:53,999 --> 01:54:56,710
'I'm going down.'

2293
01:54:56,710 --> 01:55:00,550
I stood in the gallery and looked down on
the hall below.

2294
01:55:00,550 --> 01:55:02,860
There was Giles in his white Arab costume.

2295
01:55:02,860 --> 01:55:05,809
Beatrice was wearing a long green dress.

2296
01:55:05,809 --> 01:55:07,920
Frank was dressed as a sailor.

2297
01:55:07,920 --> 01:55:09,979
Only Maxim was wearing evening clothes.

2298
01:55:09,979 --> 01:55:13,400
'I don't know what she's doing,' I heard Maxim
say.

2299
01:55:13,400 --> 01:55:15,070
'What's the time, Frank?

2300
01:55:15,070 --> 01:55:18,389
She must be down soon.'

2301
01:55:18,389 --> 01:55:21,050
I looked up at the picture of Caroline de
Winter.

2302
01:55:21,050 --> 01:55:26,840
Yes, her dress was exactly like mine and she
had the same curled hair.

2303
01:55:26,840 --> 01:55:29,840
The band was playing softly in the gallery.

2304
01:55:29,840 --> 01:55:34,489
'Beat the drum,' I said, 'and call out: Miss
Caroline de Winter.'

2305
01:55:34,489 --> 01:55:36,590
The drum sounded.

2306
01:55:36,590 --> 01:55:38,670
Everyone looked up.

2307
01:55:38,670 --> 01:55:43,170
'Miss Caroline de Winter,' the man shouted.

2308
01:55:43,170 --> 01:55:46,519
I stood at the top of the stairs, smiling.

2309
01:55:46,519 --> 01:55:50,090
I expected everyone to laugh and clap as I
walked down the stairs.

2310
01:55:50,090 --> 01:55:51,429
Nobody laughed.

2311
01:55:51,429 --> 01:55:52,769
Nobody clapped.

2312
01:55:52,769 --> 01:55:57,130
They all stared at me without moving.

2313
01:55:57,130 --> 01:55:59,280
I smiled at Maxim.

2314
01:55:59,280 --> 01:56:00,869
'How do you do, Mr de Winter?'

2315
01:56:00,869 --> 01:56:03,459
I said.

2316
01:56:03,459 --> 01:56:05,190
Maxim stared up at me.

2317
01:56:05,190 --> 01:56:07,239
His face was completely white.

2318
01:56:07,239 --> 01:56:09,130
Something was wrong.

2319
01:56:09,130 --> 01:56:11,459
Why was Maxim looking like that?

2320
01:56:11,459 --> 01:56:13,820
He moved towards the stairs.

2321
01:56:13,820 --> 01:56:17,790
'What the hell do you think you're doing?'
he said.

2322
01:56:17,790 --> 01:56:20,769
His eyes were on fire with anger.

2323
01:56:20,769 --> 01:56:23,580
'It's the picture,' I said.

2324
01:56:23,580 --> 01:56:25,610
'The one in the gallery.'

2325
01:56:25,610 --> 01:56:26,610
There was a long silence.

2326
01:56:26,610 --> 01:56:27,630
Still nobody moved.

2327
01:56:27,630 --> 01:56:29,199
'What is it?'

2328
01:56:29,199 --> 01:56:30,239
I said.

2329
01:56:30,239 --> 01:56:32,329
'What have I done?'

2330
01:56:32,329 --> 01:56:35,929
When Maxim answered, his voice was cold and
hard.

2331
01:56:35,929 --> 01:56:38,320
'Go and take off that dress!

2332
01:56:38,320 --> 01:56:40,110
It doesn't matter what you wear.

2333
01:56:40,110 --> 01:56:41,110
Any evening dress will do.

2334
01:56:41,110 --> 01:56:44,670
Go quickly, before anyone comes.'

2335
01:56:44,670 --> 01:56:45,670
I could not speak.

2336
01:56:45,670 --> 01:56:48,000
I stood staring at Maxim.

2337
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:51,559
'What are you standing there for?' he asked
me.

2338
01:56:51,559 --> 01:56:53,409
'Didn't you hear what I said?'

2339
01:56:53,409 --> 01:56:56,390
I turned and ran up the stairs.

2340
01:56:56,390 --> 01:56:57,760
My eyes were full of tears.

2341
01:56:57,760 --> 01:56:59,579
I did not know what I was doing.

2342
01:56:59,579 --> 01:57:04,030
The door to the west wing was open.

2343
01:57:04,030 --> 01:57:07,150
Mrs Danvers was standing there.

2344
01:57:07,150 --> 01:57:09,920
I shall never forget the terrible look on
her face.

2345
01:57:09,920 --> 01:57:15,340
It was a look of joy - of joy and the most
terrible hate.

2346
01:57:15,340 --> 01:57:18,959
She stood there, smiling at me.

2347
01:57:18,959 --> 01:57:24,219
Then I ran from her, back to my room, tripping
and nearly falling over my long skirt.

2348
01:57:24,219 --> 01:57:27,780
Clarice was waiting for me in my bedroom.

2349
01:57:27,780 --> 01:57:29,860
She had heard what had happened.

2350
01:57:29,860 --> 01:57:31,920
When she saw my face, Clarice started to cry.

2351
01:57:31,920 --> 01:57:33,360
'It doesn't matter, Clarice,' I said.

2352
01:57:33,360 --> 01:57:35,889
'Help me take off this dress.

2353
01:57:35,889 --> 01:57:36,889
Quickly.'

2354
01:57:36,889 --> 01:57:39,090
'What will you wear, Madam?'

2355
01:57:39,090 --> 01:57:40,690
Clarice asked me.

2356
01:57:40,690 --> 01:57:43,349
'I don't know,' I said.

2357
01:57:43,349 --> 01:57:45,489
'Leave me alone now.

2358
01:57:45,489 --> 01:57:47,050
I'll be all right.

2359
01:57:47,050 --> 01:57:49,440
Go down and enjoy the party.

2360
01:57:49,440 --> 01:57:53,519
Don't tell anyone what has happened.'

2361
01:57:53,519 --> 01:57:56,320
After Clarice had gone, someone knocked at
the door.

2362
01:57:56,320 --> 01:57:58,389
It opened and Beatrice came in.

2363
01:57:58,389 --> 01:58:00,670
'My dear,' she said, 'are you all right?'

2364
01:58:00,670 --> 01:58:05,170
I put a hand up to my head and took off the
wig.

2365
01:58:05,170 --> 01:58:08,209
'Of course I knew at once that it was a mistake,'
Beatrice said.

2366
01:58:08,209 --> 01:58:10,869
'You could not have known.'

2367
01:58:10,869 --> 01:58:12,199
'Known what?'

2368
01:58:12,199 --> 01:58:14,429
I said, turning to look at her.

2369
01:58:14,429 --> 01:58:16,559
'Why, about your costume.

2370
01:58:16,559 --> 01:58:20,920
It was exactly what Rebecca wore at the last
Fancy Dress Ball here.

2371
01:58:20,920 --> 01:58:25,230
As you stood on the stairs, I thought for
one terrible moment...'

2372
01:58:25,230 --> 01:58:29,030
'I ought to have known,' I said.

2373
01:58:29,030 --> 01:58:32,000
I was thinking of Mrs Danvers.

2374
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:33,260
She had planned this.

2375
01:58:33,260 --> 01:58:36,510
She had known what would happen.

2376
01:58:36,510 --> 01:58:38,900
'How could you know?' said Beatrice.

2377
01:58:38,900 --> 01:58:42,760
'But it was a terrible shock to Maxim.

2378
01:58:42,760 --> 01:58:44,420
He thinks that you did it as a joke.

2379
01:58:44,420 --> 01:58:47,710
He thinks that is why you kept your dress
a secret.

2380
01:58:47,710 --> 01:58:50,310
But he will understand when you speak to him.

2381
01:58:50,310 --> 01:58:54,320
I'm going to tell everyone that your dress
didn't fit.'

2382
01:58:54,320 --> 01:58:55,739
I did not say anything.

2383
01:58:55,739 --> 01:58:58,709
'Now, what can you wear?'

2384
01:58:58,709 --> 01:58:59,709
Beatrice said.

2385
01:58:59,709 --> 01:59:01,969
'Here, this blue dress is very pretty.

2386
01:59:01,969 --> 01:59:03,579
Put this on.'

2387
01:59:03,579 --> 01:59:05,199
'No,' I said.

2388
01:59:05,199 --> 01:59:07,510
'I'm not going down.'

2389
01:59:07,510 --> 01:59:09,409
Beatrice stared at me before she spoke.

2390
01:59:09,409 --> 01:59:12,229
'But, my dear, you must.

2391
01:59:12,229 --> 01:59:15,530
It will look so strange.'

2392
01:59:15,530 --> 01:59:17,019
I felt very tired.

2393
01:59:17,019 --> 01:59:19,019
'What does it matter?'

2394
01:59:19,019 --> 01:59:20,019
I said.

2395
01:59:20,019 --> 01:59:22,249
Beatrice looked shocked at my words.

2396
01:59:22,249 --> 01:59:24,030
'Think of Maxim.

2397
01:59:24,030 --> 01:59:27,030
You must come down for him,' she said.

2398
01:59:27,030 --> 01:59:32,179
'I can't, I can't,' I answered.

2399
01:59:32,179 --> 01:59:33,179
Beatrice stared at me.

2400
01:59:33,179 --> 01:59:36,440
'I must go down now,' she said at last.

2401
01:59:36,440 --> 01:59:38,830
'They will be waiting for me at dinner.

2402
01:59:38,830 --> 01:59:41,119
I'll tell Maxim you'll be down in a minute,
shall I?'

2403
01:59:41,119 --> 01:59:48,610
I did not answer and Beatrice walked slowly
to the door and went out.

2404
01:59:48,610 --> 01:59:51,860
After a long time I got up from the bed where
I was sitting.

2405
01:59:51,860 --> 01:59:53,199
I walked across to the window.

2406
01:59:53,199 --> 01:59:57,309
I could see the coloured lights in the trees.

2407
01:59:57,309 --> 02:00:02,080
I walked back to the dressing-table and looked
at my white face and red eyes in the mirror.

2408
02:00:02,080 --> 02:00:05,170
Then slowly I washed my face and combed my
hair.

2409
02:00:05,170 --> 02:00:08,670
I put the white dress and the wig back into
the box.

2410
02:00:08,670 --> 02:00:11,219
I never wanted to see them again.

2411
02:00:11,219 --> 02:00:14,330
I picked up the blue dress and put it on.

2412
02:00:14,330 --> 02:00:18,639
When I was ready, I opened the door and walked
along the corridor.

2413
02:00:18,639 --> 02:00:22,329
Everything was still and quiet.

2414
02:00:22,329 --> 02:00:24,099
Then I heard the sound of voices.

2415
02:00:24,099 --> 02:00:25,959
The door of the dining-room was open.

2416
02:00:25,959 --> 02:00:28,270
The guests were coming out of dinner.

2417
02:00:28,270 --> 02:00:29,679
Someone laughed.

2418
02:00:29,679 --> 02:00:34,199
I walked slowly down the stairs to meet them.

2419
02:00:34,199 --> 02:00:37,559
I remember very little of the first party
at Manderley.

2420
02:00:37,559 --> 02:00:40,900
It was the first and the last we ever held
there.

2421
02:00:40,900 --> 02:00:44,499
I remember that Frank tried to make me drink
a little champagne.

2422
02:00:44,499 --> 02:00:47,050
I remember Beatrice smiling at me.

2423
02:00:47,050 --> 02:00:48,050
I remember dancing with Giles.

2424
02:00:48,050 --> 02:00:52,530
The band played and people danced.

2425
02:00:52,530 --> 02:00:54,860
I stood there smiling at everyone.

2426
02:00:54,860 --> 02:00:57,030
Maxim stood beside me.

2427
02:00:57,030 --> 02:01:02,420
His eyes were cold and hard, not the eyes
of the man I knew and loved.

2428
02:01:02,420 --> 02:01:05,660
All through that long night, Maxim never looked
at me.

2429
02:01:05,660 --> 02:01:09,739
Once, Beatrice came up to me and said, 'Why
don't you sit down?

2430
02:01:09,739 --> 02:01:11,300
You look like death.'

2431
02:01:11,300 --> 02:01:13,080
What was the time?

2432
02:01:13,080 --> 02:01:14,840
I did not know.

2433
02:01:14,840 --> 02:01:16,440
The night passed, hour after hour.

2434
02:01:16,440 --> 02:01:22,820
Then at last Giles came up to me and said,
'Come and look at the fireworks on the terrace.'

2435
02:01:22,820 --> 02:01:26,459
I remember standing on the terrace and staring
up at the sky.

2436
02:01:26,459 --> 02:01:30,679
The fireworks rose into the sky and turned
into stars and flowers.

2437
02:01:30,679 --> 02:01:33,829
The sky was red and gold.

2438
02:01:33,829 --> 02:01:37,150
Every window of the house was coloured by
the falling lights.

2439
02:01:37,150 --> 02:01:41,070
The grey walls of Manderley looked heavy and
dark.

2440
02:01:41,070 --> 02:01:43,000
Then suddenly, the sky was dark too.

2441
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:44,900
The fireworks were over.

2442
02:01:44,900 --> 02:01:47,869
I heard the sound of cars starting in the
drive.

2443
02:01:47,869 --> 02:01:49,980
'They're beginning to go,' I thought.

2444
02:01:49,980 --> 02:01:53,719
'Thank God, they're beginning to go.'

2445
02:01:53,719 --> 02:01:55,060
People came up to me to say goodbye.

2446
02:01:55,060 --> 02:01:57,910
'Such a wonderful party,' they said.

2447
02:01:57,910 --> 02:02:00,469
'Thank you so much for a wonderful evening.

2448
02:02:00,469 --> 02:02:03,639
The best party I've been to for a long time.'

2449
02:02:03,639 --> 02:02:05,400
I shook hands with them all.

2450
02:02:05,400 --> 02:02:06,400
I smiled.

2451
02:02:06,400 --> 02:02:10,400
'I'm so glad, so glad,' I said.

2452
02:02:10,400 --> 02:02:14,300
I could think of no other words.

2453
02:02:14,300 --> 02:02:16,409
Maxim had gone with Frank to stand in the
drive.

2454
02:02:16,409 --> 02:02:18,099
Beatrice Came up to me.

2455
02:02:18,099 --> 02:02:20,780
'Well done, my dear,' she said.

2456
02:02:20,780 --> 02:02:22,459
'The Ball was a great success.

2457
02:02:22,459 --> 02:02:25,340
No one had any idea about... you know.

2458
02:02:25,340 --> 02:02:27,510
You must go to bed now.

2459
02:02:27,510 --> 02:02:28,949
You look very tired.

2460
02:02:28,949 --> 02:02:31,150
Have your breakfast in bed.'

2461
02:02:31,150 --> 02:02:32,150
'Yes.

2462
02:02:32,150 --> 02:02:34,670
Yes, perhaps I shall,' I said.

2463
02:02:34,670 --> 02:02:38,849
'I'll tell Maxim you've gone up to bed, shall
I?'

2464
02:02:38,849 --> 02:02:40,690
'Yes, please, Beatrice.'

2465
02:02:40,690 --> 02:02:43,150
'All right, my dear.

2466
02:02:43,150 --> 02:02:44,380
Sleep well.'

2467
02:02:44,380 --> 02:02:46,710
I walked slowly into the house.

2468
02:02:46,710 --> 02:02:48,119
The lights had been turned off.

2469
02:02:48,119 --> 02:02:49,739
The rooms were empty.

2470
02:02:49,739 --> 02:02:53,340
I went up the stairs and along the corridor
to my room.

2471
02:02:53,340 --> 02:02:56,420
It was almost light now and a bird had started
to sing.

2472
02:02:56,420 --> 02:02:59,770
I undressed slowly and got into bed.

2473
02:02:59,770 --> 02:03:03,780
I lay back and closed my eyes.

2474
02:03:03,780 --> 02:03:06,949
My body was tired, but my mind would not rest.

2475
02:03:06,949 --> 02:03:09,880
I wondered how long Maxim would be.

2476
02:03:09,880 --> 02:03:12,590
The little clock by my bed ticked away the
minutes.

2477
02:03:12,590 --> 02:03:15,760
I lay on my side, watching it.

2478
02:03:15,760 --> 02:03:18,070
An hour went by.

2479
02:03:18,070 --> 02:03:24,260
But Maxim did not come.

2480
02:03:24,260 --> 02:03:31,539
CHAPTER SIXTEEN
'Why Don't You Jump?'

2481
02:03:31,539 --> 02:03:35,090
I fell asleep at about seven o'clock.

2482
02:03:35,090 --> 02:03:39,650
When I woke up again, it was after eleven.

2483
02:03:39,650 --> 02:03:41,120
Clarice had brought me some tea.

2484
02:03:41,120 --> 02:03:44,659
It was cold now, but I drank it.

2485
02:03:44,659 --> 02:03:46,810
Maxim's bed was empty.

2486
02:03:46,810 --> 02:03:48,340
He had not come to bed at all.

2487
02:03:48,340 --> 02:03:51,999
I sat up, looking straight in front of me.

2488
02:03:51,999 --> 02:03:54,040
My marriage was a failure.

2489
02:03:54,040 --> 02:03:56,929
It had failed after only three months.

2490
02:03:56,929 --> 02:04:01,260
I was too young for Maxim, I knew too little
about the world.

2491
02:04:01,260 --> 02:04:04,690
The fact that I loved him made no difference.

2492
02:04:04,690 --> 02:04:07,510
It was not the sort of love he needed.

2493
02:04:07,510 --> 02:04:09,199
Maxim was not in love with me.

2494
02:04:09,199 --> 02:04:10,409
He had never loved me.

2495
02:04:10,409 --> 02:04:14,350
He did not belong to me, he belonged to Rebecca.

2496
02:04:14,350 --> 02:04:16,139
Rebecca was the real Mrs de Winter.

2497
02:04:16,139 --> 02:04:20,099
I could never be the mistress of Manderley.

2498
02:04:20,099 --> 02:04:24,439
Wherever I walked, wherever I sat, I saw Rebecca.

2499
02:04:24,439 --> 02:04:26,159
I knew her well.

2500
02:04:26,159 --> 02:04:30,849
I knew her tall, slim figure, her small face
and clear white skin.

2501
02:04:30,849 --> 02:04:35,079
If I ever heard her voice, I would know it.

2502
02:04:35,079 --> 02:04:37,780
Rebecca - always Rebecca.

2503
02:04:37,780 --> 02:04:40,409
I would never escape from Rebecca.

2504
02:04:40,409 --> 02:04:42,010
She was too strong for me.

2505
02:04:42,010 --> 02:04:46,869
I got out of bed and opened the curtains.

2506
02:04:46,869 --> 02:04:48,119
Sunlight filled the room.

2507
02:04:48,119 --> 02:04:51,090
I could not hide in my bedroom any longer.

2508
02:04:51,090 --> 02:04:54,369
I had a bath, dressed and went downstairs.

2509
02:04:54,369 --> 02:04:57,160
The servants had been very busy.

2510
02:04:57,160 --> 02:04:58,880
The rooms were clean and tidy.

2511
02:04:58,880 --> 02:05:00,099
The flowers had gone.

2512
02:05:00,099 --> 02:05:03,849
Soon there would be nothing to remind us of
the Fancy Dress Ball.

2513
02:05:03,849 --> 02:05:06,810
I met Robert in the dining-room.

2514
02:05:06,810 --> 02:05:09,610
'Good morning, Robert,' I said.

2515
02:05:09,610 --> 02:05:12,480
'Have you seen Mr de Winter anywhere?'

2516
02:05:12,480 --> 02:05:15,250
'He went out soon after breakfast, Madam.

2517
02:05:15,250 --> 02:05:16,840
He has not been in since.'

2518
02:05:16,840 --> 02:05:22,199
I went into the small room behind the library
and picked up the telephone.

2519
02:05:22,199 --> 02:05:24,050
Perhaps Maxim was with Frank.

2520
02:05:24,050 --> 02:05:26,459
I had to talk to Maxim.

2521
02:05:26,459 --> 02:05:29,019
I had to explain about last night.

2522
02:05:29,019 --> 02:05:33,769
'Frank, it's me,' I said when he answered.

2523
02:05:33,769 --> 02:05:34,959
'Where's Maxim?'

2524
02:05:34,959 --> 02:05:36,139
'I don't know.

2525
02:05:36,139 --> 02:05:38,280
I haven't seen him,' Frank said.

2526
02:05:38,280 --> 02:05:39,949
'How did he sleep?

2527
02:05:39,949 --> 02:05:42,559
How was he at breakfast?'

2528
02:05:42,559 --> 02:05:47,650
'Frank,' I said slowly, 'Maxim did not come
to bed last night.'

2529
02:05:47,650 --> 02:05:50,170
There was silence.

2530
02:05:50,170 --> 02:05:54,770
'I was afraid something like that would happen,'
Frank said at last.

2531
02:05:54,770 --> 02:05:57,070
'Where do you think he's gone?'

2532
02:05:57,070 --> 02:05:58,070
I asked.

2533
02:05:58,070 --> 02:05:59,860
'I must see him.

2534
02:05:59,860 --> 02:06:02,880
I've got to explain about last night.

2535
02:06:02,880 --> 02:06:05,420
Maxim thinks I did it as a joke.'

2536
02:06:05,420 --> 02:06:07,349
I could not stop my tears now.

2537
02:06:07,349 --> 02:06:10,610
They poured down my face as I spoke.

2538
02:06:10,610 --> 02:06:13,290
'You mustn't talk like that,' Frank said.

2539
02:06:13,290 --> 02:06:15,280
'Let me come up and see you.'

2540
02:06:15,280 --> 02:06:16,820
'No,' I said.

2541
02:06:16,820 --> 02:06:18,360
'It has happened.

2542
02:06:18,360 --> 02:06:20,929
Nothing can be changed now.

2543
02:06:20,929 --> 02:06:22,900
Perhaps that's a good thing.

2544
02:06:22,900 --> 02:06:25,289
I understand things more clearly now.'

2545
02:06:25,289 --> 02:06:28,580
'What do you mean?' said Frank, quickly.

2546
02:06:28,580 --> 02:06:33,119
'Maxim doesn't love me, he loves Rebecca,'
I said.

2547
02:06:33,119 --> 02:06:34,479
'He's never forgotten her.

2548
02:06:34,479 --> 02:06:36,980
He's never loved me, Frank.

2549
02:06:36,980 --> 02:06:41,040
It's always Rebecca, Rebecca, Rebecca.'

2550
02:06:41,040 --> 02:06:42,300
I heard Frank cry out.

2551
02:06:42,300 --> 02:06:45,079
'I've got to come and see you,' he said.

2552
02:06:45,079 --> 02:06:48,579
I put down the telephone stood up.

2553
02:06:48,579 --> 02:06:50,439
I did not want to see Frank.

2554
02:06:50,439 --> 02:06:51,710
He could not help me.

2555
02:06:51,710 --> 02:06:54,539
No one could help me, but myself.

2556
02:06:54,539 --> 02:06:57,449
Perhaps I would never see Maxim again.

2557
02:06:57,449 --> 02:07:00,730
Perhaps Maxim had left me and would never
come back.

2558
02:07:00,730 --> 02:07:03,800
I could not get these thoughts out of my mind.

2559
02:07:03,800 --> 02:07:06,209
I went to the window and looked out.

2560
02:07:06,209 --> 02:07:08,610
A fog had come up from the sea.

2561
02:07:08,610 --> 02:07:10,139
I could not see the woods.

2562
02:07:10,139 --> 02:07:14,440
It was very hot, but the sun was hidden behind
the wall of fog.

2563
02:07:14,440 --> 02:07:17,699
I could hear the sea and I could smell it
in the fog.

2564
02:07:17,699 --> 02:07:20,670
I walked out of the house and on to the lawn.

2565
02:07:20,670 --> 02:07:22,749
I looked back at the house.

2566
02:07:22,749 --> 02:07:26,769
One of the shutters in the west wing had been
pulled back.

2567
02:07:26,769 --> 02:07:29,610
Someone was standing there, looking down at
me.

2568
02:07:29,610 --> 02:07:33,050
For a moment, I thought that it was Maxim.

2569
02:07:33,050 --> 02:07:37,479
Then the figure moved and I saw that it was
Mrs Danvers.

2570
02:07:37,479 --> 02:07:40,170
I felt that she knew about my tears.

2571
02:07:40,170 --> 02:07:42,769
She had planned all this to happen.

2572
02:07:42,769 --> 02:07:47,010
This was her triumph - hers and Rebecca's.

2573
02:07:47,010 --> 02:07:50,239
I remembered Mrs Danvers smiling at me, like
a devil.

2574
02:07:50,239 --> 02:07:53,389
But she was a living woman like myself.

2575
02:07:53,389 --> 02:07:55,199
She was not dead, like Rebecca.

2576
02:07:55,199 --> 02:08:00,500
I could not speak to Rebecca, but I could
speak to Mrs Danvers.

2577
02:08:00,500 --> 02:08:02,559
I walked back across the lawn.

2578
02:08:02,559 --> 02:08:07,400
I went through the house, along the dark silent
corridor of the west wing to Rebecca's room.

2579
02:08:07,400 --> 02:08:11,189
I turned the handle of the door and went inside.

2580
02:08:11,189 --> 02:08:13,670
Mrs Danvers was still standing by the window.

2581
02:08:13,670 --> 02:08:16,130
The shutter was folded back.

2582
02:08:16,130 --> 02:08:19,459
She turned to me and I saw that her eyes were
red with crying.

2583
02:08:19,459 --> 02:08:23,679
There were dark shadows on her white face.

2584
02:08:23,679 --> 02:08:26,360
'You've done what you wanted, Mrs Danvers,'
I said.

2585
02:08:26,360 --> 02:08:28,032
'You wanted this to happen, didn't you?

2586
02:08:28,032 --> 02:08:29,940
Are you pleased now?

2587
02:08:29,940 --> 02:08:32,570
Are you happy?'

2588
02:08:32,570 --> 02:08:34,110
She turned her head away from me.

2589
02:08:34,110 --> 02:08:37,749
'Why did you ever come to Manderley?'

2590
02:08:37,749 --> 02:08:39,139
she said.

2591
02:08:39,139 --> 02:08:40,139
'Nobody wanted you.

2592
02:08:40,139 --> 02:08:43,179
We were all right until you came.'

2593
02:08:43,179 --> 02:08:46,380
'You seem to forget that I love Mr de Winter,'
I said.

2594
02:08:46,380 --> 02:08:50,659
'If you loved him, you would never have married
him,' Mrs Danvers said.

2595
02:08:50,659 --> 02:08:52,019
'Why do you hate me?'

2596
02:08:52,019 --> 02:08:53,019
I asked.

2597
02:08:53,019 --> 02:08:55,659
'What have I done to you?'

2598
02:08:55,659 --> 02:09:00,210
'You tried to take Mrs de Winter's place,'
she said.

2599
02:09:00,210 --> 02:09:02,469
'But I changed nothing here.

2600
02:09:02,469 --> 02:09:04,179
I left everything to you.

2601
02:09:04,179 --> 02:09:07,729
I wanted to be friends with you,' I said.

2602
02:09:07,729 --> 02:09:09,219
She did not answer.

2603
02:09:09,219 --> 02:09:12,380
'Many people marry twice,' I said.

2604
02:09:12,380 --> 02:09:15,760
'My marriage to Mr de Winter isn't a crime.

2605
02:09:15,760 --> 02:09:17,099
Haven't we a right to be happy?'

2606
02:09:17,099 --> 02:09:23,550
'Mr de Winter is not happy,' Mrs Danvers said,
looking at me at last.

2607
02:09:23,550 --> 02:09:25,159
'Look into his eyes.

2608
02:09:25,159 --> 02:09:26,829
He's in hell.

2609
02:09:26,829 --> 02:09:30,459
He has looked like that ever since she died.'

2610
02:09:30,459 --> 02:09:32,929
'It's not true,' I said.

2611
02:09:32,929 --> 02:09:33,929
'It's not true.

2612
02:09:33,929 --> 02:09:35,550
He was happy when we were in Italy together.'

2613
02:09:35,550 --> 02:09:38,230
'Well, he's a man, isn't he?'

2614
02:09:38,230 --> 02:09:39,929
she said with a hard laugh.

2615
02:09:39,929 --> 02:09:42,579
'Every man likes to enjoy his honeymoon.'

2616
02:09:42,579 --> 02:09:48,489
I was suddenly very angry and not afraid of
Mrs Danvers any more.

2617
02:09:48,489 --> 02:09:50,489
I went up to her and shook her by the arm.

2618
02:09:50,489 --> 02:09:53,689
'How dare you speak to me like that?

2619
02:09:53,689 --> 02:09:54,889
How dare you?

2620
02:09:54,889 --> 02:09:56,699
You made me wear that dress last night.

2621
02:09:56,699 --> 02:09:58,429
You wanted to hurt Mr de Winter.

2622
02:09:58,429 --> 02:10:02,610
Do you think his pain and unhappiness will
bring Mrs de Winter back?'

2623
02:10:02,610 --> 02:10:04,989
Mrs Danvers moved away from me.

2624
02:10:04,989 --> 02:10:07,820
'What do I care for his pain?'

2625
02:10:07,820 --> 02:10:08,820
she said.

2626
02:10:08,820 --> 02:10:10,719
'He's never cared about mine.

2627
02:10:10,719 --> 02:10:16,059
How do you think I've felt, watching you sit
in her place, using the things she used?

2628
02:10:16,059 --> 02:10:18,840
I hear the servants calling you Mrs de Winter.

2629
02:10:18,840 --> 02:10:24,010
And all the time, the real Mrs de Winter,
with her smile and her lovely face is lying

2630
02:10:24,010 --> 02:10:25,820
cold and dead in the church.'

2631
02:10:25,820 --> 02:10:28,709
Mrs Danvers' face was twisted with pain.

2632
02:10:28,709 --> 02:10:30,719
Her voice was loud and hard.

2633
02:10:30,719 --> 02:10:36,929
'Mr de Winter deserves his pain, marrying
a young girl like you - and only ten months

2634
02:10:36,929 --> 02:10:37,929
afterwards.

2635
02:10:37,929 --> 02:10:40,080
Well, he's paying for it now.

2636
02:10:40,080 --> 02:10:42,559
He knows she is watching him.

2637
02:10:42,559 --> 02:10:45,020
My lady comes at night and watches him.

2638
02:10:45,020 --> 02:10:47,570
'I looked after her when she was a child.

2639
02:10:47,570 --> 02:10:48,840
Did you know that?'

2640
02:10:48,840 --> 02:10:49,840
'No,' I said, 'no.

2641
02:10:49,840 --> 02:10:50,840
What's the use of this, Mrs Danvers?

2642
02:10:50,840 --> 02:10:55,429
I don't want to hear any more.'

2643
02:10:55,429 --> 02:10:57,670
Mrs Danvers did not seem to hear me.

2644
02:10:57,670 --> 02:11:00,769
She went on speaking in a high, harsh voice.

2645
02:11:00,769 --> 02:11:05,039
'Mrs de Winter was a lovely child,' she said.

2646
02:11:05,039 --> 02:11:11,099
'When she was only twelve years old, the men
could not stop looking at her.

2647
02:11:11,099 --> 02:11:13,215
But even then, she cared for nothing and nobody.

2648
02:11:13,215 --> 02:11:15,079
And that's how she was when she grew up.

2649
02:11:15,079 --> 02:11:16,260
She was beaten in the end.

2650
02:11:16,260 --> 02:11:17,650
But it wasn't a man.

2651
02:11:17,650 --> 02:11:18,909
It wasn't a woman.

2652
02:11:18,909 --> 02:11:21,099
The sea got her.

2653
02:11:21,099 --> 02:11:24,619
The sea was too strong for her in the end.'

2654
02:11:24,619 --> 02:11:29,479
Mrs Danvers began to cry noisily, with her
mouth open and her eyes dry.

2655
02:11:29,479 --> 02:11:32,179
'Mrs Danvers, you're not well.

2656
02:11:32,179 --> 02:11:34,639
You ought to be in bed,' I said.

2657
02:11:34,639 --> 02:11:35,639
She looked at me angrily.

2658
02:11:35,639 --> 02:11:37,960
'Leave me alone.

2659
02:11:37,960 --> 02:11:38,969
Why shouldn't I cry?

2660
02:11:38,969 --> 02:11:41,550
What's it to do with you?

2661
02:11:41,550 --> 02:11:44,739
You came here and thought you could take Mrs
de Winter's place.

2662
02:11:44,739 --> 02:11:45,739
You!

2663
02:11:45,739 --> 02:11:48,999
Why, even the servants laughed at you when
you came to Manderley.'

2664
02:11:48,999 --> 02:11:52,159
'You'd better stop this, Mrs Danvers,' I said.

2665
02:11:52,159 --> 02:11:55,189
'You'd better go to your room.'

2666
02:11:55,189 --> 02:11:56,249
'Yes.

2667
02:11:56,249 --> 02:11:57,460
And then what will you do?

2668
02:11:57,460 --> 02:12:01,440
You'll go to Mr de Winter and tell him that
Mrs Danvers has been unkind to you.

2669
02:12:01,440 --> 02:12:05,929
You'll go to him like you did when Mr Favell
came here.

2670
02:12:05,929 --> 02:12:10,030
'Mr de Winter was jealous of Mr Favell when
she was alive.

2671
02:12:10,030 --> 02:12:11,119
He's jealous now.

2672
02:12:11,119 --> 02:12:14,689
That shows you he's not forgotten her, doesn't
it?

2673
02:12:14,689 --> 02:12:16,749
Of course Mr de Winter was jealous.

2674
02:12:16,749 --> 02:12:17,749
She didn't care.

2675
02:12:17,749 --> 02:12:19,300
She only laughed.

2676
02:12:19,300 --> 02:12:22,860
All the men fell in love with her, Mr de Winter,
Mr Favell, Mr Crawley.

2677
02:12:22,860 --> 02:12:24,070
It was like a game to her.'

2678
02:12:24,070 --> 02:12:28,409
'I don't want to know,' I said.

2679
02:12:28,409 --> 02:12:30,650
'I don't want to know.'

2680
02:12:30,650 --> 02:12:33,949
Mrs Danvers came close to me and put her face
near to mine.

2681
02:12:33,949 --> 02:12:36,949
'It's no use, is it?'

2682
02:12:36,949 --> 02:12:38,219
she said.

2683
02:12:38,219 --> 02:12:40,850
'She's the real Mrs de Winter, not you.'

2684
02:12:40,850 --> 02:12:44,219
I backed away from her, towards the window.

2685
02:12:44,219 --> 02:12:47,229
She took my hand and held it.

2686
02:12:47,229 --> 02:12:50,050
'Why don't you go?' she said again.

2687
02:12:50,050 --> 02:12:53,070
'He doesn't want you, he never did.

2688
02:12:53,070 --> 02:12:56,510
He can't forget her.

2689
02:12:56,510 --> 02:12:59,349
He wants to be alone in the house again, with
her.'

2690
02:12:59,349 --> 02:13:02,370
She pushed me towards the open window.

2691
02:13:02,370 --> 02:13:04,769
I could see the stones of the terrace below.

2692
02:13:04,769 --> 02:13:07,639
Beyond the terrace was a white wall of fog.

2693
02:13:07,639 --> 02:13:11,539
'Look down there,' Mrs Danvers said.

2694
02:13:11,539 --> 02:13:14,130
'It's easy, isn't it?

2695
02:13:14,130 --> 02:13:16,729
Why don't you jump?

2696
02:13:16,729 --> 02:13:17,780
It wouldn't hurt.

2697
02:13:17,780 --> 02:13:19,539
It's not like drowning.

2698
02:13:19,539 --> 02:13:21,729
Why don't you try it?

2699
02:13:21,729 --> 02:13:23,499
Why don't you go?'

2700
02:13:23,499 --> 02:13:29,920
The fog came in through the open window, damp
and thick.

2701
02:13:29,920 --> 02:13:32,329
I held on to the window ledge with both hands.

2702
02:13:32,329 --> 02:13:36,130
'Don't be afraid,' said Mrs Danvers.

2703
02:13:36,130 --> 02:13:40,190
'I won't push you.

2704
02:13:40,190 --> 02:13:41,190
You can jump.

2705
02:13:41,190 --> 02:13:42,190
You're not happy.

2706
02:13:42,190 --> 02:13:44,090
Mr de Winter doesn't love you.

2707
02:13:44,090 --> 02:13:46,479
Why don't you jump now?'

2708
02:13:46,479 --> 02:13:49,969
The fog was thicker than before.

2709
02:13:49,969 --> 02:13:53,349
There was fog below and all around me.

2710
02:13:53,349 --> 02:13:56,690
If I jumped now, I would not see the stones.

2711
02:13:56,690 --> 02:13:59,099
The fall would kill me.

2712
02:13:59,099 --> 02:14:00,320
Maxim did not love me.

2713
02:14:00,320 --> 02:14:02,999
'Go on,' whispered Mrs Danvers.

2714
02:14:02,999 --> 02:14:05,690
'Go on, don't be afraid.'

2715
02:14:05,690 --> 02:14:08,590
I shut my eyes.

2716
02:14:08,590 --> 02:14:13,520
My fingers ached from holding the ledge.

2717
02:14:13,520 --> 02:14:16,640
The thick fog made me forget my unhappiness.

2718
02:14:16,640 --> 02:14:21,099
I could forget about loving Maxim.

2719
02:14:21,099 --> 02:14:22,209
I could forget about Rebecca.

2720
02:14:22,209 --> 02:14:25,139
I would not have to think about Rebecca any
more...

2721
02:14:25,139 --> 02:14:28,650
A loud explosion shook the window where we
stood.

2722
02:14:28,650 --> 02:14:29,949
The glass cracked.

2723
02:14:29,949 --> 02:14:33,429
I opened my eyes and stared at Mrs Danvers.

2724
02:14:33,429 --> 02:14:37,980
The first explosion was followed by another,
then a third and a fourth.

2725
02:14:37,980 --> 02:14:39,449
'What is it?'

2726
02:14:39,449 --> 02:14:40,449
I said.

2727
02:14:40,449 --> 02:14:41,900
'What has happened?'

2728
02:14:41,900 --> 02:14:44,830
Mrs Danvers let go my arm.

2729
02:14:44,830 --> 02:14:48,780
She stared out of the window into the fog.

2730
02:14:48,780 --> 02:14:50,753
'It's the rockets,' she said.

2731
02:14:50,753 --> 02:14:54,139
'There must be a ship in trouble in the bay.'

2732
02:14:54,139 --> 02:14:57,539
We listened, staring into the white fog together.

2733
02:14:57,539 --> 02:15:12,099
And then we heard the sound of footsteps on
the terrace below us.

2734
02:15:12,099 --> 02:15:20,039
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
Rebecca Has Won

2735
02:15:20,039 --> 02:15:24,949
It was Maxim down on the terrace.

2736
02:15:24,949 --> 02:15:27,239
I could not see him, but I could hear his
voice.

2737
02:15:27,239 --> 02:15:30,000
I heard Frith answer from the hall.

2738
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:33,880
'A ship's hit the rocks in the bay,' Maxim
called out.

2739
02:15:33,880 --> 02:15:36,280
'The fog is terrible out there.

2740
02:15:36,280 --> 02:15:39,579
Tell Mrs Danvers to have food and drink ready
for the men.

2741
02:15:39,579 --> 02:15:42,210
I'm going back to the bay to see if I can
do anything.'

2742
02:15:42,210 --> 02:15:45,189
Mrs Danvers moved back from the window.

2743
02:15:45,189 --> 02:15:49,489
'We had better go down,' she said in her usual
voice.

2744
02:15:49,489 --> 02:15:52,000
'Frith will be looking for me.

2745
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:54,099
Be careful of your hands.

2746
02:15:54,099 --> 02:15:57,030
I am going to close the window.'

2747
02:15:57,030 --> 02:15:59,429
Then she went to the door and held it open
for me.

2748
02:15:59,429 --> 02:16:04,340
'When you see Mr de Winter, Madam, please
tell him there will be a hot meal ready for

2749
02:16:04,340 --> 02:16:06,840
the men at any time.'

2750
02:16:06,840 --> 02:16:08,420
I stared at her.

2751
02:16:08,420 --> 02:16:10,939
'Yes,' I said.

2752
02:16:10,939 --> 02:16:14,229
'Yes, Mrs Danvers.'

2753
02:16:14,229 --> 02:16:17,269
She turned her back on me and went along the
corridor.

2754
02:16:17,269 --> 02:16:18,939
I walked slowly out of the room.

2755
02:16:18,939 --> 02:16:23,400
I felt as though I had just woken up from
a long sleep.

2756
02:16:23,400 --> 02:16:26,979
When I reached the hall, I saw Frith.

2757
02:16:26,979 --> 02:16:30,019
'Did you hear the rockets, Madam?' he said.

2758
02:16:30,019 --> 02:16:32,740
'Mr de Winter's gone down to the bay.

2759
02:16:32,740 --> 02:16:36,710
He went across the lawn only a few minutes
ago.'

2760
02:16:36,710 --> 02:16:38,920
I went out on to the terrace.

2761
02:16:38,920 --> 02:16:42,070
The fog was beginning to clear and I could
see the woods again.

2762
02:16:42,070 --> 02:16:44,050
I looked up at the window above my head.

2763
02:16:44,050 --> 02:16:46,270
It looked very high.

2764
02:16:46,270 --> 02:16:48,730
I suddenly felt very hot.

2765
02:16:48,730 --> 02:16:51,170
My head ached and my hands were wet.

2766
02:16:51,170 --> 02:16:54,060
I stood very still.

2767
02:16:54,060 --> 02:16:57,190
Then for the first time I realized that Maxim
had not gone away.

2768
02:16:57,190 --> 02:17:01,760
I had heard his voice and he was down there
in the bay.

2769
02:17:01,760 --> 02:17:04,360
Maxim was safe.

2770
02:17:04,360 --> 02:17:07,620
Nothing else mattered if Maxim was safe.

2771
02:17:07,620 --> 02:17:10,290
I began to walk along the path through the
woods.

2772
02:17:10,290 --> 02:17:12,670
The fog had almost gone now.

2773
02:17:12,670 --> 02:17:14,153
When I came to the bay, I could see the ship
at once.

2774
02:17:14,153 --> 02:17:18,710
She was on the rocks about two miles from
the shore.

2775
02:17:18,710 --> 02:17:20,480
There were some small boats near her.

2776
02:17:20,480 --> 02:17:24,630
I climbed up the path to the cliffs above
the bay.

2777
02:17:24,630 --> 02:17:27,350
Frank was there talking to a coast-guard,
but I could not see Maxim.

2778
02:17:27,350 --> 02:17:32,700
'They're going to send a diver down soon,
Mrs de Winter,' said the coastguard.

2779
02:17:32,700 --> 02:17:35,180
'They want to see if they can get the ship
off the rocks.'

2780
02:17:35,180 --> 02:17:37,450
'Have you seen Maxim?'

2781
02:17:37,450 --> 02:17:39,140
I asked Frank.

2782
02:17:39,140 --> 02:17:42,840
'He's taken one of the sailors to hospital,'
Frank told me.

2783
02:17:42,840 --> 02:17:45,060
'The man was hurt.

2784
02:17:45,060 --> 02:17:47,490
Maxim is always a great help at times like
this.

2785
02:17:47,490 --> 02:17:49,500
What are you going to do?

2786
02:17:49,500 --> 02:17:51,420
Can I walk back with you to the house?'

2787
02:17:51,420 --> 02:17:53,780
'I think I'll stay here.

2788
02:17:53,780 --> 02:17:56,590
I want to see the diver go down,' I said.

2789
02:17:56,590 --> 02:17:58,650
'Very well,' Frank said.

2790
02:17:58,650 --> 02:18:01,980
'I shall be at the office if you want me.'

2791
02:18:01,980 --> 02:18:03,830
The coastguard looked at his watch.

2792
02:18:03,830 --> 02:18:06,450
'Well, I must be getting along too,' he said.

2793
02:18:06,450 --> 02:18:07,450
'Good afternoon.'

2794
02:18:07,450 --> 02:18:10,830
The sea was calm now.

2795
02:18:10,830 --> 02:18:13,100
The diver went down and came up again.

2796
02:18:13,100 --> 02:18:14,570
Nothing else happened.

2797
02:18:14,570 --> 02:18:16,350
It was very hot.

2798
02:18:16,350 --> 02:18:20,240
I sat on the cliffs for a long time doing
nothing, thinking of nothing.

2799
02:18:20,240 --> 02:18:23,801
When I looked at my watch again, it was three
o'clock.

2800
02:18:23,801 --> 02:18:27,130
I got up and walked down the hill to the bay.

2801
02:18:27,130 --> 02:18:29,610
When I came to the other side, I saw Ben.

2802
02:18:29,610 --> 02:18:32,010
He stood there, smiling at me.

2803
02:18:32,010 --> 02:18:35,280
'Seen the big ship?' he said.

2804
02:18:35,280 --> 02:18:37,540
'Yes,' I said.

2805
02:18:37,540 --> 02:18:40,210
'She's on the rocks, isn't she?'

2806
02:18:40,210 --> 02:18:42,020
'She'll break up,' he said.

2807
02:18:42,020 --> 02:18:46,170
'The big ship won't go down like the little
one.

2808
02:18:46,170 --> 02:18:48,929
She won't come back, will she?'

2809
02:18:48,929 --> 02:18:49,929
'Who?'

2810
02:18:49,929 --> 02:18:51,250
I asked him.

2811
02:18:51,250 --> 02:18:52,770
'Her,' he said.

2812
02:18:52,770 --> 02:18:55,500
'The other one.'

2813
02:18:55,500 --> 02:18:57,560
I did not know what Ben meant.

2814
02:18:57,560 --> 02:19:00,830
I left him and walked towards the path through
the woods.

2815
02:19:00,830 --> 02:19:02,660
I did not look at the cottage.

2816
02:19:02,660 --> 02:19:06,040
As I went up the path, a strange fear began
to fill my heart.

2817
02:19:06,040 --> 02:19:09,080
The house looked very peaceful.

2818
02:19:09,080 --> 02:19:13,170
Manderley was a place of safety and looked
more beautiful than I had ever seen it.

2819
02:19:13,170 --> 02:19:18,010
I felt, for the first time, that it was my
home.

2820
02:19:18,010 --> 02:19:21,820
I belonged to Manderley and Manderley belonged
to me.

2821
02:19:21,820 --> 02:19:24,520
I went through the house and into the library.

2822
02:19:24,520 --> 02:19:26,190
Jasper was not there.

2823
02:19:26,190 --> 02:19:28,820
He must have gone out with Maxim.

2824
02:19:28,820 --> 02:19:32,460
I suddenly felt very hungry, and so I asked
Robert to bring in the tea.

2825
02:19:32,460 --> 02:19:36,160
I still had a strange feeling of fear in my
heart.

2826
02:19:36,160 --> 02:19:40,610
I felt that I was waiting for something - something
terrible.

2827
02:19:40,610 --> 02:19:45,150
As I sat drinking my tea, Robert came back
into the room.

2828
02:19:45,150 --> 02:19:49,910
'Captain Searle, the harbour-master, is on
the phone, Madam,' he told me.

2829
02:19:49,910 --> 02:19:53,000
'He wants to come here and speak to Mr de
Winter at once.

2830
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:54,320
He says it's very important.'

2831
02:19:54,320 --> 02:19:58,620
'Mr de Winter is not back yet, Robert,' I
told him.

2832
02:19:58,620 --> 02:20:02,180
'Ask Captain Searle to come up and wait.'

2833
02:20:02,180 --> 02:20:04,550
Robert went out of the room with the message.

2834
02:20:04,550 --> 02:20:06,561
I wondered what Captain Searle wanted to say.

2835
02:20:06,561 --> 02:20:09,370
It must be something to do with the ship out
in the bay.

2836
02:20:09,370 --> 02:20:13,630
But why did he want to see Maxim?

2837
02:20:13,630 --> 02:20:16,500
Captain Searle came into the library about
fifteen minutes later.

2838
02:20:16,500 --> 02:20:19,080
He looked at me with his bright blue eyes.

2839
02:20:19,080 --> 02:20:23,530
'I'm afraid I've got some bad news for Mr
de Winter.

2840
02:20:23,530 --> 02:20:24,980
I don't know how to tell him.'

2841
02:20:24,980 --> 02:20:27,540
'What sort of news, Captain Searle?'

2842
02:20:27,540 --> 02:20:29,290
I asked him.

2843
02:20:29,290 --> 02:20:32,101
'Well, Mrs de Winter, it's not very pleasant.

2844
02:20:32,101 --> 02:20:37,740
When we sent the diver down to look at the
ship, he found something else.

2845
02:20:37,740 --> 02:20:40,221
It was a little sailing boat.

2846
02:20:40,221 --> 02:20:43,220
It's the boat that belonged to the late Mrs
de Winter.'

2847
02:20:43,220 --> 02:20:46,290
'I'm sorry,' I said.

2848
02:20:46,290 --> 02:20:49,220
'Must you tell Mr de Winter?

2849
02:20:49,220 --> 02:20:51,794
Can't the boat be left there?'

2850
02:20:51,794 --> 02:20:55,550
'The man found something else,' Captain Searle
answered slowly.

2851
02:20:55,550 --> 02:20:59,641
'The cabin door was closed, so he broke a
window and looked in.

2852
02:20:59,641 --> 02:21:03,080
Then he got a terrible fright.

2853
02:21:03,080 --> 02:21:06,511
There was a body in there on the cabin floor.

2854
02:21:06,511 --> 02:21:09,540
I must tell your husband, Mrs de Winter.

2855
02:21:09,540 --> 02:21:12,920
The police will have to know too.'

2856
02:21:12,920 --> 02:21:16,460
This was the reason for the strange fear in
my heart.

2857
02:21:16,460 --> 02:21:18,891
Someone had been in the boat with Rebecca
that night.

2858
02:21:18,891 --> 02:21:21,210
'Do we have to tell him?'

2859
02:21:21,210 --> 02:21:22,290
I asked.

2860
02:21:22,290 --> 02:21:26,500
'I've got to do my duty,' Captain Searle said.

2861
02:21:26,500 --> 02:21:27,500
He stopped.

2862
02:21:27,500 --> 02:21:28,990
The door had opened.

2863
02:21:28,990 --> 02:21:30,490
It was Maxim.

2864
02:21:30,490 --> 02:21:32,230
'Hello,' he said.

2865
02:21:32,230 --> 02:21:34,590
'Is something the matter, Captain Searle?'

2866
02:21:34,590 --> 02:21:37,160
I felt very afraid.

2867
02:21:37,160 --> 02:21:40,961
I went out of the room quickly and shut the
door behind me.

2868
02:21:40,961 --> 02:21:43,930
Jasper was in the hall and he walked out on
to the terrace with me.

2869
02:21:43,930 --> 02:21:45,091
I sat down.

2870
02:21:45,091 --> 02:21:47,271
I must not fail Maxim now.

2871
02:21:47,271 --> 02:21:52,510
I sat on the terrace until I heard Captain
Searle's car drive away.

2872
02:21:52,510 --> 02:21:56,230
Then I stood up and walked slowly back to
the library.

2873
02:21:56,230 --> 02:21:58,150
Maxim was standing by the window.

2874
02:21:58,150 --> 02:21:59,931
I went and stood beside him.

2875
02:21:59,931 --> 02:22:03,590
I took his hand and held it against my face.

2876
02:22:03,590 --> 02:22:05,384
'I want to help you, Maxim,' I said.

2877
02:22:05,384 --> 02:22:07,050
'I've grown up, you know.

2878
02:22:07,050 --> 02:22:12,801
I'm not a child any more.'

2879
02:22:12,801 --> 02:22:15,550
Maxim put his arm round me and held me closely.

2880
02:22:15,550 --> 02:22:19,750
'I was angry with you last night, wasn't I?'
he said.

2881
02:22:19,750 --> 02:22:26,160
'Maxim,' I asked him, 'can't we start again?'

2882
02:22:26,160 --> 02:22:29,190
'It's too late, my darling, too late,' he
said.

2883
02:22:29,190 --> 02:22:32,710
'We've lost our chance of happiness.

2884
02:22:32,710 --> 02:22:34,521
Something has happened.

2885
02:22:34,521 --> 02:22:37,351
Something I've dreamt about, night after night.

2886
02:22:37,351 --> 02:22:39,351
I knew we could never be happy.'

2887
02:22:39,351 --> 02:22:43,751
Maxim held both my hands and looked into my
face.

2888
02:22:43,751 --> 02:22:47,511
'Rebecca has won,' he said.

2889
02:22:47,511 --> 02:22:49,061
I stared at him.

2890
02:22:49,061 --> 02:22:51,280
My heart began to beat fast.

2891
02:22:51,280 --> 02:22:53,150
What was Maxim trying to tell me?

2892
02:22:53,150 --> 02:22:56,720
'I always knew this would happen,' Maxim said.

2893
02:22:56,720 --> 02:23:00,260
'Rebecca has kept us apart all this time.

2894
02:23:00,260 --> 02:23:02,431
I remember how she looked at me before she
died.

2895
02:23:02,431 --> 02:23:04,721
I remember her smile.

2896
02:23:04,721 --> 02:23:07,000
She knew this would happen.

2897
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:08,370
She knew she would win in the end.'

2898
02:23:08,370 --> 02:23:09,370
'Maxim,' I whispered.

2899
02:23:09,370 --> 02:23:12,400
'What are you trying to tell me?

2900
02:23:12,400 --> 02:23:15,860
Captain Searle told me about the boat.

2901
02:23:15,860 --> 02:23:17,631
There was someone sailing with Rebecca.

2902
02:23:17,631 --> 02:23:20,480
You have to find out who it was.

2903
02:23:20,480 --> 02:23:23,240
That's it, isn't it, Maxim?'

2904
02:23:23,240 --> 02:23:27,011
'No,' he said, 'you don't understand.

2905
02:23:27,011 --> 02:23:28,960
There was no one with Rebecca.

2906
02:23:28,960 --> 02:23:32,171
She was alone.'

2907
02:23:32,171 --> 02:23:35,641
I stood there watching his face, watching
his eyes.

2908
02:23:35,641 --> 02:23:40,851
'It's Rebecca's body lying there on the cabin
floor.'

2909
02:23:40,851 --> 02:23:42,760
'No,' I said.

2910
02:23:42,760 --> 02:23:43,760
'No!'

2911
02:23:43,760 --> 02:23:46,620
'The woman buried in the church is not Rebecca.

2912
02:23:46,620 --> 02:23:49,260
I always knew that,' Maxim said.

2913
02:23:49,260 --> 02:23:51,920
'Rebecca was not drowned.

2914
02:23:51,920 --> 02:23:53,460
I killed her.

2915
02:23:53,460 --> 02:23:56,221
I shot Rebecca in the cottage.

2916
02:23:56,221 --> 02:24:00,720
I carried her body to the cabin, took the
boat out that night and sank it.

2917
02:24:00,720 --> 02:24:04,440
It's Rebecca who's lying there on the cabin
floor.

2918
02:24:04,440 --> 02:24:24,400
Will you look into my eyes and tell me that
you love me now?'

2919
02:24:24,400 --> 02:24:26,771
CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
The Truth About Rebecca

2920
02:24:26,771 --> 02:24:30,910
It was very quiet in the library.

2921
02:24:30,910 --> 02:24:34,190
When people have a great shock, they feel
nothing at first.

2922
02:24:34,190 --> 02:24:38,330
I stood beside Maxim and I had no feelings
at all.

2923
02:24:38,330 --> 02:24:42,471
Then Maxim took me in his arms and began to
kiss me.

2924
02:24:42,471 --> 02:24:44,950
I shut my eyes.

2925
02:24:44,950 --> 02:24:48,011
He had never kissed me like this before.

2926
02:24:48,011 --> 02:24:50,920
'I love you so much,' he whispered.

2927
02:24:50,920 --> 02:24:54,450
This is what I had wanted him to say, every
day and every night.

2928
02:24:54,450 --> 02:24:58,110
But I could feel nothing now.

2929
02:24:58,110 --> 02:25:00,521
Maxim stopped suddenly and pushed me away
from him.

2930
02:25:00,521 --> 02:25:03,750
'You see, I was right,' he said.

2931
02:25:03,750 --> 02:25:04,920
'It's too late.

2932
02:25:04,920 --> 02:25:06,530
You don't love me now.'

2933
02:25:06,530 --> 02:25:10,410
'It's not too late,' I said, putting my arms
round him.

2934
02:25:10,410 --> 02:25:14,021
'I love you more than anything in the world.'

2935
02:25:14,021 --> 02:25:16,240
'It's no use now,' said Maxim.

2936
02:25:16,240 --> 02:25:17,990
'We have no time.

2937
02:25:17,990 --> 02:25:19,960
They've found the boat.

2938
02:25:19,960 --> 02:25:21,320
They've found Rebecca.'

2939
02:25:21,320 --> 02:25:24,960
I stared at him, not understanding.

2940
02:25:24,960 --> 02:25:27,290
'What will they do?'

2941
02:25:27,290 --> 02:25:28,450
I said.

2942
02:25:28,450 --> 02:25:32,021
'They will make sure that the body in the
cabin is Rebecca.

2943
02:25:32,021 --> 02:25:35,931
Then they will remember that other body in
the church.

2944
02:25:35,931 --> 02:25:38,930
The other woman - the one I said was Rebecca.'

2945
02:25:38,930 --> 02:25:41,670
'What are we going to do?'

2946
02:25:41,670 --> 02:25:43,590
I said.

2947
02:25:43,590 --> 02:25:45,170
Maxim did not answer.

2948
02:25:45,170 --> 02:25:47,540
'Does anyone know?

2949
02:25:47,540 --> 02:25:49,110
Anyone at all?'

2950
02:25:49,110 --> 02:25:50,200
I said.

2951
02:25:50,200 --> 02:25:51,210
Maxim shook his head.

2952
02:25:51,210 --> 02:25:53,990
'Are you sure Frank doesn't know?'

2953
02:25:53,990 --> 02:25:55,300
I asked quickly.

2954
02:25:55,300 --> 02:25:58,330
'How could he?' said Maxim.

2955
02:25:58,330 --> 02:26:00,551
'There was nobody there but me.

2956
02:26:00,551 --> 02:26:03,000
It was dark...'

2957
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:04,000
He stopped.

2958
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:06,730
He sat down on a chair and I went and knelt
beside him.

2959
02:26:06,730 --> 02:26:07,990
'Why didn't you tell me?'

2960
02:26:07,990 --> 02:26:09,150
I whispered.

2961
02:26:09,150 --> 02:26:14,400
'I nearly did, once,' Maxim said.

2962
02:26:14,400 --> 02:26:19,250
'But you always seemed so unhappy and so shy.'

2963
02:26:19,250 --> 02:26:21,000
I answered very quietly.

2964
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:24,771
'I knew you were thinking about Rebecca all
the time.

2965
02:26:24,771 --> 02:26:29,280
How could I ask you to love me when I knew
you loved Rebecca?'

2966
02:26:29,280 --> 02:26:31,980
'You thought I loved Rebecca?'

2967
02:26:31,980 --> 02:26:32,980
he said.

2968
02:26:32,980 --> 02:26:35,340
'I hated her.

2969
02:26:35,340 --> 02:26:36,970
We never loved each other.

2970
02:26:36,970 --> 02:26:41,051
Rebecca never loved anyone except herself.'

2971
02:26:41,051 --> 02:26:43,311
I sat on the floor, staring at him.

2972
02:26:43,311 --> 02:26:46,330
'She was clever of course,' Maxim went on.

2973
02:26:46,330 --> 02:26:50,000
'Everyone thought she was the kindest, the
most charming person.

2974
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:53,391
When I married her, people told me I was the
luckiest man in the world.'

2975
02:26:53,391 --> 02:26:56,891
'I found out the truth five days after we
were married.

2976
02:26:56,891 --> 02:26:59,300
We were in the hills near Monte Carlo.

2977
02:26:59,300 --> 02:27:01,920
It was the same place I went to with you.

2978
02:27:01,920 --> 02:27:02,930
Do you remember?

2979
02:27:02,930 --> 02:27:05,800
She sat there in the car and told me terrible,
evil things about herself.

2980
02:27:05,800 --> 02:27:09,330
Things that I could not tell anyone.'

2981
02:27:09,330 --> 02:27:11,820
Maxim stared out of the window.

2982
02:27:11,820 --> 02:27:15,101
'I did not kill her then,' he said.

2983
02:27:15,101 --> 02:27:17,650
'I let her laugh.

2984
02:27:17,650 --> 02:27:19,940
She knew that I would take her to Manderley.

2985
02:27:19,940 --> 02:27:22,040
She knew I would never divorce her.

2986
02:27:22,040 --> 02:27:26,880
I would never tell people all the terrible
things she had told me.'

2987
02:27:26,880 --> 02:27:30,080
Maxim came up to me and held out his hands.

2988
02:27:30,080 --> 02:27:32,750
'You hate me, don't you?' he said.

2989
02:27:32,750 --> 02:27:36,261
'You can't understand me, can you?'

2990
02:27:36,261 --> 02:27:38,051
I did not say anything.

2991
02:27:38,051 --> 02:27:40,920
I held his hands against my heart.

2992
02:27:40,920 --> 02:27:43,001
Only one thing mattered.

2993
02:27:43,001 --> 02:27:45,240
Maxim did not love Rebecca.

2994
02:27:45,240 --> 02:27:49,800
He had never loved her, never, never.

2995
02:27:49,800 --> 02:27:51,500
Maxim was talking again.

2996
02:27:51,500 --> 02:27:55,280
'I thought about Manderley too much,' he said.

2997
02:27:55,280 --> 02:27:58,790
'I put Manderley first, before anything else.

2998
02:27:58,790 --> 02:28:01,570
I can't tell you about those terrible years
with Rebecca.

2999
02:28:01,570 --> 02:28:05,010
But she made Manderley the place of beauty
it is today.

3000
02:28:05,010 --> 02:28:09,470
And I accepted everything, because of Manderley.

3001
02:28:09,470 --> 02:28:12,220
'Rebecca was careful at first,' Maxim went
on.

3002
02:28:12,220 --> 02:28:13,860
'She had a flat in London.

3003
02:28:13,860 --> 02:28:15,421
She met her friends there.

3004
02:28:15,421 --> 02:28:18,290
Then she began to grow careless.

3005
02:28:18,290 --> 02:28:21,090
She invited friends down here, to Manderley.

3006
02:28:21,090 --> 02:28:22,630
I warned her.

3007
02:28:22,630 --> 02:28:24,550
I told her that Manderley was mine.

3008
02:28:24,550 --> 02:28:26,400
Rebecca did not say anything.

3009
02:28:26,400 --> 02:28:28,420
She only smiled.

3010
02:28:28,420 --> 02:28:31,660
'Then Frank came to me and told me he wanted
to leave.

3011
02:28:31,660 --> 02:28:34,360
He wouldn't say why at first.

3012
02:28:34,360 --> 02:28:36,791
But I got the truth from him in the end.

3013
02:28:36,791 --> 02:28:38,751
Rebecca never left him alone.

3014
02:28:38,751 --> 02:28:43,260
She was always going to his house and asking
him to her cottage.

3015
02:28:43,260 --> 02:28:45,591
'Rebecca went up to London for a time.

3016
02:28:45,591 --> 02:28:49,320
When she came back, she took Giles out sailing
with her.

3017
02:28:49,320 --> 02:28:53,070
I knew what had happened as soon as they came
back.

3018
02:28:53,070 --> 02:28:56,471
Beatrice and Giles never stayed at Manderley
again.

3019
02:28:56,471 --> 02:29:00,250
After that, I knew I could never trust Rebecca
with anyone.

3020
02:29:00,250 --> 02:29:04,610
'She had a cousin, an awful man, called Jack
Favell.

3021
02:29:04,610 --> 02:29:07,000
He started to come here when I was away.'

3022
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:08,720
'I've met him,' I said.

3023
02:29:08,720 --> 02:29:10,851
'He came here the day you went to London.

3024
02:29:10,851 --> 02:29:12,421
I didn't tell you.

3025
02:29:12,421 --> 02:29:14,450
I didn't want to remind you of Rebecca.'

3026
02:29:14,450 --> 02:29:16,500
'Remind me?' said Maxim.

3027
02:29:16,500 --> 02:29:20,780
'Oh God, I never needed to be reminded.

3028
02:29:20,780 --> 02:29:23,660
'Favell often stayed with Rebecca down at
the cottage.

3029
02:29:23,660 --> 02:29:24,990
He is a bad man.

3030
02:29:24,990 --> 02:29:28,591
He's been in trouble with the police many
times.

3031
02:29:28,591 --> 02:29:32,320
I told Rebecca that I would shoot Favell if
he came to Manderley again.

3032
02:29:32,320 --> 02:29:36,870
'Then, one night, I could stand our life here
no longer.

3033
02:29:36,870 --> 02:29:38,950
Rebecca came back from London very late.

3034
02:29:38,950 --> 02:29:41,080
She went to the cottage.

3035
02:29:41,080 --> 02:29:43,000
I thought Favell was with her.

3036
02:29:43,000 --> 02:29:44,590
I went after them.

3037
02:29:44,590 --> 02:29:47,800
I took a gun to frighten him.'

3038
02:29:47,800 --> 02:29:50,131
Maxim was talking in quick, short sentences.

3039
02:29:50,131 --> 02:29:51,920
I held his hand tightly.

3040
02:29:51,920 --> 02:29:55,170
'I saw a light in the cottage and went in.

3041
02:29:55,170 --> 02:29:57,470
To my surprise, Rebecca was alone.

3042
02:29:57,470 --> 02:30:00,391
She looked ill and strange.

3043
02:30:00,391 --> 02:30:01,440
"This is the end," I told her.

3044
02:30:01,440 --> 02:30:03,700
"I can't stand any more."

3045
02:30:03,700 --> 02:30:05,440
Rebecca looked at me and smiled.

3046
02:30:05,440 --> 02:30:08,190
"It won't be easy to divorce me," she said.

3047
02:30:08,190 --> 02:30:10,400
"Everyone believes our marriage is perfect."

3048
02:30:10,400 --> 02:30:12,830
'Then she stood up and walked towards me.

3049
02:30:12,830 --> 02:30:17,391
"If I had a child, Max," she said, "Everyone
would think it was yours.

3050
02:30:17,391 --> 02:30:19,460
You would like a son, wouldn't you?

3051
02:30:19,460 --> 02:30:22,040
A boy to grow up at Manderley.

3052
02:30:22,040 --> 02:30:24,790
And you would never know who his father was."

3053
02:30:24,790 --> 02:30:26,620
'And she smiled at me again.

3054
02:30:26,620 --> 02:30:29,460
She was smiling when I killed her.

3055
02:30:29,460 --> 02:30:32,670
The bullet went through her heart.'

3056
02:30:32,670 --> 02:30:33,920
Maxim's voice was very low.

3057
02:30:33,920 --> 02:30:35,030
He spoke slowly.

3058
02:30:35,030 --> 02:30:38,130
'There was blood all over the floor.

3059
02:30:38,130 --> 02:30:40,882
I had to get water from the sea to clean the
place.

3060
02:30:40,882 --> 02:30:45,700
'There was no moon and it was very dark,'
Maxim went on.

3061
02:30:45,700 --> 02:30:47,960
'I carried Rebecca's body to the boat.

3062
02:30:47,960 --> 02:30:51,210
I laid the body on the floor of the cabin.

3063
02:30:51,210 --> 02:30:54,720
Then I took the boat out into the bay.

3064
02:30:54,720 --> 02:30:58,430
I wanted to take the boat a good way out,
but the wind was too strong for me.

3065
02:30:58,430 --> 02:31:02,900
'I made some holes in the wooden planks with
a metal spike.

3066
02:31:02,900 --> 02:31:05,320
I opened the sea cocks and the sea water flowed
in.

3067
02:31:05,320 --> 02:31:08,510
In a few minutes it had covered my feet.

3068
02:31:08,510 --> 02:31:14,130
I shut the cabin door behind me, climbed into
the dinghy and rowed back.

3069
02:31:14,130 --> 02:31:16,021
Rebecca's boat was already sinking.

3070
02:31:16,021 --> 02:31:19,870
I sat and watched it go down.'

3071
02:31:19,870 --> 02:31:21,101
Maxim looked at me.

3072
02:31:21,101 --> 02:31:23,400
'That's all,' he said.

3073
02:31:23,400 --> 02:31:25,150
'There's no more to tell.'

3074
02:31:25,150 --> 02:31:28,530
The library was very quiet.

3075
02:31:28,530 --> 02:31:33,750
We sat there together for some minutes without
saying anything.

3076
02:31:33,750 --> 02:31:35,980
Then Maxim began to speak again.

3077
02:31:35,980 --> 02:31:40,610
'I knew the boat would be found one day,'
he said.

3078
02:31:40,610 --> 02:31:42,710
'Rebecca knew she would win in the end.

3079
02:31:42,710 --> 02:31:44,570
I saw her smile when she died.'

3080
02:31:44,570 --> 02:31:47,940
'But Rebecca is dead,' I told him.

3081
02:31:47,940 --> 02:31:50,471
'That's what we must remember.'

3082
02:31:50,471 --> 02:31:53,410
'The diver has seen the body.

3083
02:31:53,410 --> 02:31:56,490
They're going to get the boat up tomorrow
morning.

3084
02:31:56,490 --> 02:31:59,771
They'll find out that it's Rebecca's body
in the cabin.'

3085
02:31:59,771 --> 02:32:03,170
'Then you must say you made a mistake about
the other body.

3086
02:32:03,170 --> 02:32:04,771
Nobody saw you that night.

3087
02:32:04,771 --> 02:32:08,820
We are the only two people who know what happened
that night, Maxim.'

3088
02:32:08,820 --> 02:32:10,431
'Yes,' he said.

3089
02:32:10,431 --> 02:32:12,590
'Yes, I suppose so.'

3090
02:32:12,590 --> 02:32:16,410
'They will think the boat sank when Rebecca
went down into the cabin.

3091
02:32:16,410 --> 02:32:19,370
They'll think she was trapped there.

3092
02:32:19,370 --> 02:32:22,340
They'll think that, won't they, Maxim?'

3093
02:32:22,340 --> 02:32:23,340
I said.

3094
02:32:23,340 --> 02:32:27,410
'I don't know,' Maxim replied slowly.

3095
02:32:27,410 --> 02:32:29,590
'I don't know.'

3096
02:32:29,590 --> 02:32:42,250
At that moment, the telephone in the next
room began to ring.

3097
02:32:42,250 --> 02:32:47,710
CHAPTER NINETEEN
Colonel Julyan

3098
02:32:47,710 --> 02:32:50,610
Maxim went into the little room and closed
the door.

3099
02:32:50,610 --> 02:32:54,311
I sat there, listening to the sound of Maxim's
voice.

3100
02:32:54,311 --> 02:32:59,130
I was no longer afraid of Rebecca; I did not
hate her any more.

3101
02:32:59,130 --> 02:33:01,580
Maxim and I were going to fight this together.

3102
02:33:01,580 --> 02:33:05,521
Rebecca had not won, she had lost.

3103
02:33:05,521 --> 02:33:09,601
'That was Colonel Julyan,' said Maxim, as
he came back into the room.

3104
02:33:09,601 --> 02:33:11,630
He is the local magistrate.

3105
02:33:11,630 --> 02:33:14,980
He has to be there when they get the boat
up tomorrow.

3106
02:33:14,980 --> 02:33:18,521
He asked me if I had made a mistake about
the other body.'

3107
02:33:18,521 --> 02:33:21,860
The telephone began to ring again.

3108
02:33:21,860 --> 02:33:25,540
Maxim answered it quickly and came back into
the library.

3109
02:33:25,540 --> 02:33:27,080
'It's begun,' he said.

3110
02:33:27,080 --> 02:33:29,721
'What do you mean?' asked.

3111
02:33:29,721 --> 02:33:31,381
'That was a reporter.

3112
02:33:31,381 --> 02:33:33,590
The whole thing will be in the papers tomorrow.

3113
02:33:33,590 --> 02:33:36,120
There's nothing we can do.'

3114
02:33:36,120 --> 02:33:39,591
After dinner, we went back into the library
as usual.

3115
02:33:39,591 --> 02:33:44,570
I sat at Maxim's feet, my head against his
knees.

3116
02:33:44,570 --> 02:33:47,950
In a strange way, we were completely happy.

3117
02:33:47,950 --> 02:33:49,800
Rain fell in the night.

3118
02:33:49,800 --> 02:33:52,920
When I woke up in the morning, Maxim had already
gone out.

3119
02:33:52,920 --> 02:33:56,480
I went down to breakfast as usual.

3120
02:33:56,480 --> 02:33:58,470
There were a lot of letters thanking us for
the Ball.

3121
02:33:58,470 --> 02:34:00,950
How far away that seemed!

3122
02:34:00,950 --> 02:34:05,170
I felt calmer, much older now.

3123
02:34:05,170 --> 02:34:06,341
I took the letters into the morning-room.

3124
02:34:06,341 --> 02:34:10,710
To my surprise, the room was dusty and untidy.

3125
02:34:10,710 --> 02:34:14,760
The windows were tightly closed and some of
the flowers were dead.

3126
02:34:14,760 --> 02:34:19,680
I rang the bell for a maid and when she came,
I spoke to her angrily.

3127
02:34:19,680 --> 02:34:22,730
I wondered why I had been frightened of the
servants before.

3128
02:34:22,730 --> 02:34:25,460
The menu for the day lay on the desk.

3129
02:34:25,460 --> 02:34:28,271
It was the same food as the day before.

3130
02:34:28,271 --> 02:34:31,540
I crossed everything out and rang for Robert.

3131
02:34:31,540 --> 02:34:35,960
'Tell Mrs Danvers to order something different,'
I told him.

3132
02:34:35,960 --> 02:34:38,470
Then I went out into the garden and cut some
roses.

3133
02:34:38,470 --> 02:34:41,580
Very soon Maxim will be back, I thought.

3134
02:34:41,580 --> 02:34:43,880
I must be calm and quiet.

3135
02:34:43,880 --> 02:34:46,290
I took the roses back into the morning-room.

3136
02:34:46,290 --> 02:34:48,601
It was clean and tidy now.

3137
02:34:48,601 --> 02:34:52,641
As I began to arrange the flowers, there was
a knock at the door.

3138
02:34:52,641 --> 02:34:56,891
It was Mrs Danvers, holding the menu in her
hand.

3139
02:34:56,891 --> 02:34:58,811
She looked pale and tired.

3140
02:34:58,811 --> 02:35:02,070
'I don't understand,' she said.

3141
02:35:02,070 --> 02:35:05,210
'I'm not used to having messages sent by Robert.

3142
02:35:05,210 --> 02:35:09,300
When Mrs de Winter wanted any change in the
menu, she spoke to me herself.'

3143
02:35:09,300 --> 02:35:13,230
'I am Mrs de Winter now, Mrs Danvers,' I said.

3144
02:35:13,230 --> 02:35:16,830
'And I shall do things in my own way.'

3145
02:35:16,830 --> 02:35:18,610
Mrs Danvers stared at me.

3146
02:35:18,610 --> 02:35:26,190
'Is it true,' she asked slowly, 'that Mrs
de Winter's boat has been found and that there

3147
02:35:26,190 --> 02:35:27,771
was a body in the cabin?'

3148
02:35:27,771 --> 02:35:32,370
'I am afraid I don't know anything about that,'
I said.

3149
02:35:32,370 --> 02:35:33,800
'Don't you?'

3150
02:35:33,800 --> 02:35:35,960
Mrs Danvers said.

3151
02:35:35,960 --> 02:35:37,620
She stood looking at me.

3152
02:35:37,620 --> 02:35:38,710
I turned away.

3153
02:35:38,710 --> 02:35:42,931
'I will give orders about the lunch,' she
said.

3154
02:35:42,931 --> 02:35:45,860
She waited, but I did not say anything.

3155
02:35:45,860 --> 02:35:48,910
She went out of the room.

3156
02:35:48,910 --> 02:35:51,160
Mrs Danvers did not frighten me any more.

3157
02:35:51,160 --> 02:35:53,860
She was my enemy and I did not care.

3158
02:35:53,860 --> 02:35:59,311
But if she learnt the truth about Rebecca's
death, she would become Maxim's enemy too.

3159
02:35:59,311 --> 02:36:01,200
I suddenly felt sick and ill.

3160
02:36:01,200 --> 02:36:04,800
I went out on to the terrace and began to
walk up and down.

3161
02:36:04,800 --> 02:36:09,170
At half past eleven, Maxim phoned me from
Frank's office.

3162
02:36:09,170 --> 02:36:12,940
He told me he was bringing Colonel Julyan
and Frank back for lunch.

3163
02:36:12,940 --> 02:36:14,530
The time dragged by.

3164
02:36:14,530 --> 02:36:18,790
At five to one, I heard the sound of a car
in the drive.

3165
02:36:18,790 --> 02:36:22,500
Maxim came into the hall with Frank and Colonel
Julyan.

3166
02:36:22,500 --> 02:36:27,300
Colonel Julyan, the magistrate, was a middle-aged
man with a kind face and grey hair.

3167
02:36:27,300 --> 02:36:32,090
'This is most unpleasant for you and your
husband,' Colonel Julyan said to me.

3168
02:36:32,090 --> 02:36:35,730
'I feel very sorry for both of you.'

3169
02:36:35,730 --> 02:36:40,230
Maxim and Frank went on into the dining-room
and Colonel Julyan continued to speak to me

3170
02:36:40,230 --> 02:36:41,230
quietly.

3171
02:36:41,230 --> 02:36:43,820
'We found a body in the boat this morning.

3172
02:36:43,820 --> 02:36:47,040
It is the body of the late Mrs de Winter.

3173
02:36:47,040 --> 02:36:52,521
As you know, Mr de Winter identified the other
body found in the sea as his wife.

3174
02:36:52,521 --> 02:36:55,080
That makes things rather difficult for us
now.'

3175
02:36:55,080 --> 02:36:59,710
The Colonel stopped suddenly as Maxim came
back into the hall.

3176
02:36:59,710 --> 02:37:03,311
'Lunch is ready; shall we go in?' he said.

3177
02:37:03,311 --> 02:37:05,500
I did not look at Maxim during lunch.

3178
02:37:05,500 --> 02:37:10,631
We talked about the weather and Colonel Julyan
asked me about my life in France.

3179
02:37:10,631 --> 02:37:14,131
Frith and Robert were in the room and no one
wanted to talk about the boat.

3180
02:37:14,131 --> 02:37:18,190
At last Frith served coffee and the servants
left us.

3181
02:37:18,190 --> 02:37:24,660
'I wish an inquest wasn't necessary,' Colonel
Julyan said, 'but I'm afraid it is.

3182
02:37:24,660 --> 02:37:26,880
I don't think it will take very long.

3183
02:37:26,880 --> 02:37:30,830
De Winter will have to say that the body in
the boat was the late Mrs de Winter.

3184
02:37:30,830 --> 02:37:34,650
Then the boat-builder will say that the boat
was in good order when he last saw it.

3185
02:37:34,650 --> 02:37:36,761
This must be done.'

3186
02:37:36,761 --> 02:37:40,021
'That's quite all right,' Maxim said.

3187
02:37:40,021 --> 02:37:41,601
'We understand.'

3188
02:37:41,601 --> 02:37:46,271
'I suppose Mrs de Winter had to go down into
the cabin for something.

3189
02:37:46,271 --> 02:37:49,450
Then the door shut and, somehow, she was trapped
there.

3190
02:37:49,450 --> 02:37:51,280
Don't you think so, Crawley?'

3191
02:37:51,280 --> 02:37:52,630
the Colonel asked Frank.

3192
02:37:52,630 --> 02:37:55,851
'Oh yes, of course,' said Frank.

3193
02:37:55,851 --> 02:37:58,780
I had a sudden feeling that Frank knew the
truth.

3194
02:37:58,780 --> 02:38:02,700
'The inquest will be on Tuesday afternoon,'
Colonel Julyan told us.

3195
02:38:02,700 --> 02:38:08,980
'We'll keep it as short as possible, but I'm
afraid the reporters will be there.'

3196
02:38:08,980 --> 02:38:10,660
There was another silence.

3197
02:38:10,660 --> 02:38:13,190
'Shall we go into the garden?'

3198
02:38:13,190 --> 02:38:14,261
I said.

3199
02:38:14,261 --> 02:38:19,011
We all stood on the terrace for a moment and
then Colonel Julyan looked at his watch.

3200
02:38:19,011 --> 02:38:22,150
'Thank you for the lunch,' he said to me.

3201
02:38:22,150 --> 02:38:24,311
'I'm afraid I must leave now.

3202
02:38:24,311 --> 02:38:27,170
Would you like a lift, Crawley?'

3203
02:38:27,170 --> 02:38:28,460
Maxim walked with them to the car.

3204
02:38:28,460 --> 02:38:31,450
When they had gone, he came back to me on
the terrace.

3205
02:38:31,450 --> 02:38:34,320
'It's going to be all right,' Maxim said.

3206
02:38:34,320 --> 02:38:36,550
'There won't be any trouble at the inquest.

3207
02:38:36,550 --> 02:38:38,780
There is nothing to show what I did.

3208
02:38:38,780 --> 02:38:43,171
Colonel Julyan thinks she was trapped in the
cabin and the jury will think that too.'

3209
02:38:43,171 --> 02:38:45,130
I said nothing.

3210
02:38:45,130 --> 02:38:48,970
'It's you I'm sorry for,' Maxim told me sadly.

3211
02:38:48,970 --> 02:38:51,320
'I don't care about anything else.

3212
02:38:51,320 --> 02:38:53,130
I'm glad that I killed Rebecca.

3213
02:38:53,130 --> 02:38:56,060
But I can't forget what this has done to you.

3214
02:38:56,060 --> 02:38:59,030
You have lost that young, sweet look.

3215
02:38:59,030 --> 02:39:01,141
And it will never come back.

3216
02:39:01,141 --> 02:39:07,471
In twenty-four hours, you have grown so much
older.'

3217
02:39:07,471 --> 02:39:10,690
Frith brought in the newspapers at breakfast
the following day.

3218
02:39:10,690 --> 02:39:12,190
The story was in all of them.

3219
02:39:12,190 --> 02:39:16,340
There was a picture of Manderley and an awful
one of Maxim.

3220
02:39:16,340 --> 02:39:20,950
All the papers said that Rebecca's body had
been found after the Fancy Dress Ball.

3221
02:39:20,950 --> 02:39:23,061
They said how everyone had loved Rebecca.

3222
02:39:23,061 --> 02:39:28,030
They all said that Maxim had married his young,
second wife within a year of Rebecca's death.

3223
02:39:28,030 --> 02:39:30,460
It all made a good story.

3224
02:39:30,460 --> 02:39:34,110
Maxim's face went whiter and whiter.

3225
02:39:34,110 --> 02:39:36,960
I wondered what the papers would say if they
knew the truth.

3226
02:39:36,960 --> 02:39:41,670
That terrible word - murder - would be on
every front page.

3227
02:39:41,670 --> 02:39:44,101
Frank was a great help to us.

3228
02:39:44,101 --> 02:39:46,590
We had no more phone calls from reporters
and no visitors.

3229
02:39:46,590 --> 02:39:53,170
It was just a question of waiting - of waiting
until Tuesday.

3230
02:39:53,170 --> 02:39:56,490
Maxim and I stayed quietly in the house or
in the gardens.

3231
02:39:56,490 --> 02:39:59,851
We did not walk in the woods or go down to
the sea.

3232
02:39:59,851 --> 02:40:02,320
The weather was very hot and the air was heavy.

3233
02:40:02,320 --> 02:40:06,290
There were clouds, but the rain did not fall.

3234
02:40:06,290 --> 02:40:18,690
CHAPTER TWENTY
The 

3235
02:40:18,690 --> 02:40:19,690
Inquest

3236
02:40:19,690 --> 02:40:22,280
Tuesday came at last.

3237
02:40:22,280 --> 02:40:24,650
The inquest was at two o'clock.

3238
02:40:24,650 --> 02:40:28,570
After an early lunch, I drove into the town
with Maxim.

3239
02:40:28,570 --> 02:40:31,990
'I think I shall stay here in the car,' I
said.

3240
02:40:31,990 --> 02:40:33,690
'I won't come in with you after all.'

3241
02:40:33,690 --> 02:40:36,471
'I didn't want you to come,' Maxim said.

3242
02:40:36,471 --> 02:40:40,630
'I wish you had stayed at Manderley.'

3243
02:40:40,630 --> 02:40:42,420
Maxim went off and left me sitting there.

3244
02:40:42,420 --> 02:40:43,891
The minutes went by.

3245
02:40:43,891 --> 02:40:46,101
I wondered what was happening at the inquest.

3246
02:40:46,101 --> 02:40:49,561
I got out of the car and began walking up
and down.

3247
02:40:49,561 --> 02:40:51,721
A policeman looked at me.

3248
02:40:51,721 --> 02:40:54,370
'Excuse me, Madam,' he said.

3249
02:40:54,370 --> 02:40:57,040
'Aren't you Mrs de Winter?

3250
02:40:57,040 --> 02:40:59,001
You can wait inside if you like.'

3251
02:40:59,001 --> 02:41:01,920
The policeman took me into an empty room.

3252
02:41:01,920 --> 02:41:03,320
Five minutes passed.

3253
02:41:03,320 --> 02:41:04,320
Nothing happened.

3254
02:41:04,320 --> 02:41:06,760
I got up and walked out of the little room.

3255
02:41:06,760 --> 02:41:08,280
The policeman was still standing there.

3256
02:41:08,280 --> 02:41:10,210
'How long will they be?'

3257
02:41:10,210 --> 02:41:11,370
I asked him.

3258
02:41:11,370 --> 02:41:14,800
'I'll go and see if you like,' the policeman
said.

3259
02:41:14,800 --> 02:41:16,500
He was back again in a moment.

3260
02:41:16,500 --> 02:41:20,150
'It won't last much longer,' he told me.

3261
02:41:20,150 --> 02:41:23,460
'Mr de Winter has just finished giving his
evidence.

3262
02:41:23,460 --> 02:41:26,601
There's only the boat-builder, Mr Tabb, to
speak now.

3263
02:41:26,601 --> 02:41:28,000
Would you like to go in?

3264
02:41:28,000 --> 02:41:31,080
There's an empty seat near the door.'

3265
02:41:31,080 --> 02:41:32,141
I followed the policeman.

3266
02:41:32,141 --> 02:41:35,820
He opened the door for me and I went in quietly
and sat down.

3267
02:41:35,820 --> 02:41:38,510
The room was small and full of people.

3268
02:41:38,510 --> 02:41:41,550
The air was hot and stuffy.

3269
02:41:41,550 --> 02:41:44,030
Frank was sitting next to Maxim.

3270
02:41:44,030 --> 02:41:49,261
To my surprise, Mrs Danvers was there too,
with Favell beside her.

3271
02:41:49,261 --> 02:41:51,841
I wondered whether Maxim had seen him.

3272
02:41:51,841 --> 02:41:57,820
Tabb, the boat-builder, standing in the centre
of the room, was answering the Coroner's questions.

3273
02:41:57,820 --> 02:42:00,420
'Was the boat in good condition?'

3274
02:42:00,420 --> 02:42:02,051
the Coroner was asking.

3275
02:42:02,051 --> 02:42:07,000
'Yes, it certainly was the last time I saw
it,' Tabb said.

3276
02:42:07,000 --> 02:42:09,681
'It was a strong little boat.

3277
02:42:09,681 --> 02:42:11,880
I can't understand why it sank that night.'

3278
02:42:11,880 --> 02:42:15,980
'Accidents have happened before,' the Coroner
said.

3279
02:42:15,980 --> 02:42:19,771
'Mrs de Winter was careless for a moment and
she died.'

3280
02:42:19,771 --> 02:42:24,140
'Excuse me, sir,' said the boat-builder.

3281
02:42:24,140 --> 02:42:26,490
'I would like to say something else.'

3282
02:42:26,490 --> 02:42:30,990
'Very well, go on,' said the Coroner.

3283
02:42:30,990 --> 02:42:33,320
'It's this, sir.

3284
02:42:33,320 --> 02:42:36,171
There was nothing wrong with that boat when
I last saw it.

3285
02:42:36,171 --> 02:42:38,900
So what I want to know is this.

3286
02:42:38,900 --> 02:42:42,720
Who made those holes in the planks?

3287
02:42:42,720 --> 02:42:43,860
Rocks didn't do it.

3288
02:42:43,860 --> 02:42:46,410
The boat sank too far away from them.

3289
02:42:46,410 --> 02:42:50,370
And those holes were mad with something sharp.'

3290
02:42:50,370 --> 02:42:52,290
I could not look at anyone.

3291
02:42:52,290 --> 02:42:54,930
I stared down at the floor.

3292
02:42:54,930 --> 02:42:58,061
For a moment, the Coroner was too surprised
to speak.

3293
02:42:58,061 --> 02:43:00,760
Then he said, 'What do you mean?

3294
02:43:00,760 --> 02:43:02,811
What sort of holes?'

3295
02:43:02,811 --> 02:43:06,351
'There were three of them, in different parts
of the boat.

3296
02:43:06,351 --> 02:43:08,000
And that's not all.

3297
02:43:08,000 --> 02:43:11,480
The sea-cocks had been turned full on.'

3298
02:43:11,480 --> 02:43:12,840
'The sea-cocks?

3299
02:43:12,840 --> 02:43:16,230
What are they?' asked the Coroner.

3300
02:43:16,230 --> 02:43:20,450
'The sea-cocks close the pipes leading to
the wash-basins, sir.

3301
02:43:20,450 --> 02:43:23,660
They must be kept tightly closed when the
boat is sailing.

3302
02:43:23,660 --> 02:43:26,400
Otherwise the sea water comes in.'

3303
02:43:26,400 --> 02:43:30,150
It was hot in that crowded room, far too hot.

3304
02:43:30,150 --> 02:43:32,040
I wished someone would open a window.

3305
02:43:32,040 --> 02:43:34,920
The boat-builder was speaking again.

3306
02:43:34,920 --> 02:43:40,291
'With those holes, sir, and the sea-cocks
open, a small boat like Mrs de Winter's would

3307
02:43:40,291 --> 02:43:41,561
soon sink.

3308
02:43:41,561 --> 02:43:44,980
It's my opinion that there was no accident.

3309
02:43:44,980 --> 02:43:47,480
That boat was sunk on purpose.'

3310
02:43:47,480 --> 02:43:51,261
I must try and get out of the door, I thought.

3311
02:43:51,261 --> 02:43:53,130
There was no air.

3312
02:43:53,130 --> 02:43:55,690
People were standing up and talking loudly.

3313
02:43:55,690 --> 02:43:59,751
I heard the Coroner say, 'Mr de Winter.'

3314
02:43:59,751 --> 02:44:00,880
Maxim was standing up.

3315
02:44:00,880 --> 02:44:02,510
I could not look at him.

3316
02:44:02,510 --> 02:44:07,440
'Mr de Winter,' the Coroner said, 'you have
heard James Tabb's evidence.

3317
02:44:07,440 --> 02:44:09,630
Do you know anything about those holes?'

3318
02:44:09,630 --> 02:44:10,630
'Nothing.'

3319
02:44:10,630 --> 02:44:15,240
'Can you think why they are there?'

3320
02:44:15,240 --> 02:44:18,040
'No, of course not.'

3321
02:44:18,040 --> 02:44:21,260
'This news is a shock to you, of course?'

3322
02:44:21,260 --> 02:44:23,080
'Of course it is a shock.

3323
02:44:23,080 --> 02:44:25,750
Does it surprise you that I am shocked?'

3324
02:44:25,750 --> 02:44:28,311
Maxim's voice was hard and angry.

3325
02:44:28,311 --> 02:44:33,050
Oh God, I thought, don't let Maxim lose his
temper.

3326
02:44:33,050 --> 02:44:34,840
The Coroner was speaking again.

3327
02:44:34,840 --> 02:44:39,890
'Mr de Winter, I want to find out exactly
how your late wife died.

3328
02:44:39,890 --> 02:44:43,000
Who looked after Mrs de Winter's boat?'

3329
02:44:43,000 --> 02:44:44,710
'She looked after it herself.'

3330
02:44:44,710 --> 02:44:52,311
'Then whoever took the boat out that night
also made those holes and opened the sea-cocks.'

3331
02:44:52,311 --> 02:44:54,880
'I suppose so.'

3332
02:44:54,880 --> 02:45:00,061
'You have told us that the door and windows
of the cabin were shut?'

3333
02:45:00,061 --> 02:45:01,061
'Yes.'

3334
02:45:01,061 --> 02:45:04,530
'Doesn't this seem very strange to you, Mr
de Winter?'

3335
02:45:04,530 --> 02:45:06,840
'Yes, it does.'

3336
02:45:06,840 --> 02:45:10,710
'Mr de Winter, I'm afraid I must ask you one
other question.

3337
02:45:10,710 --> 02:45:15,320
Were you and the late Mrs de Winter happily
married?'

3338
02:45:15,320 --> 02:45:18,680
It was hot, so hot.

3339
02:45:18,680 --> 02:45:21,480
I tried to stand up, but I could not.

3340
02:45:21,480 --> 02:45:23,461
The ground came up to meet me.

3341
02:45:23,461 --> 02:45:26,480
And then I heard Maxim's voice, clear and
strong.

3342
02:45:26,480 --> 02:45:28,420
'Will someone take my wife outside?

3343
02:45:28,420 --> 02:45:32,240
She is going to faint.'

3344
02:45:32,240 --> 02:45:34,420
I was sitting in the little room again.

3345
02:45:34,420 --> 02:45:35,610
Frank was beside me.

3346
02:45:35,610 --> 02:45:37,410
'I'm sorry,' I said.

3347
02:45:37,410 --> 02:45:40,120
'It was so hot in there.'

3348
02:45:40,120 --> 02:45:43,420
'Are you feeling better, Mrs de Winter?'

3349
02:45:43,420 --> 02:45:44,420
Frank asked.

3350
02:45:44,420 --> 02:45:47,920
'Maxim has told me to take you back to Manderley.'

3351
02:45:47,920 --> 02:45:49,330
Frank helped me to get up.

3352
02:45:49,330 --> 02:45:52,591
'I'd much rather stay,' I said.

3353
02:45:52,591 --> 02:45:55,210
'I want to wait for Maxim.'

3354
02:45:55,210 --> 02:45:57,910
'Maxim may be some time,' Frank told me.

3355
02:45:57,910 --> 02:46:00,001
'They may have to go over the evidence again.'

3356
02:46:00,001 --> 02:46:03,790
'But what are they trying to find out?'

3357
02:46:03,790 --> 02:46:04,790
Frank did not answer.

3358
02:46:04,790 --> 02:46:08,360
We were in his car now and he was driving
very fast.

3359
02:46:08,360 --> 02:46:10,640
'Did you see Favell there?'

3360
02:46:10,640 --> 02:46:11,640
I asked.

3361
02:46:11,640 --> 02:46:13,740
'He was sitting with Mrs Danvers.

3362
02:46:13,740 --> 02:46:16,311
I don't trust them, Frank.

3363
02:46:16,311 --> 02:46:18,380
They might make trouble.'

3364
02:46:18,380 --> 02:46:19,900
Frank did not answer.

3365
02:46:19,900 --> 02:46:21,960
He could not know how much Maxim had told
me.

3366
02:46:21,960 --> 02:46:24,101
Then we were back at Manderley.

3367
02:46:24,101 --> 02:46:26,671
'Will you be all right now?'

3368
02:46:26,671 --> 02:46:27,671
Frank asked me.

3369
02:46:27,671 --> 02:46:29,430
'I shall go back.

3370
02:46:29,430 --> 02:46:31,311
Maxim may want me.'

3371
02:46:31,311 --> 02:46:34,190
He got quickly back into the car again and
drove away.

3372
02:46:34,190 --> 02:46:38,061
I went upstairs to my room, and lay down on
my bed.

3373
02:46:38,061 --> 02:46:40,260
What were they all saying now?

3374
02:46:40,260 --> 02:46:41,260
What was happening?

3375
02:46:41,260 --> 02:46:45,271
What would I do if Frank came back to Manderley
without Maxim?

3376
02:46:45,271 --> 02:46:48,440
I thought again of that dreadful word - murder.

3377
02:46:48,440 --> 02:46:51,370
God, let me not think about it.

3378
02:46:51,370 --> 02:46:57,000
Let me think about something else, anything...

3379
02:46:57,000 --> 02:46:58,860
I must have fallen asleep.

3380
02:46:58,860 --> 02:46:59,970
I woke up suddenly.

3381
02:46:59,970 --> 02:47:02,170
It was five o'clock.

3382
02:47:02,170 --> 02:47:04,170
I got up and went to the window.

3383
02:47:04,170 --> 02:47:06,690
There was no wind.

3384
02:47:06,690 --> 02:47:09,090
Lightning flashed against the grey sky.

3385
02:47:09,090 --> 02:47:10,750
I heard thunder in the distance.

3386
02:47:10,750 --> 02:47:14,680
A few drops of rain began to fall.

3387
02:47:14,680 --> 02:47:21,061
I went downstairs and sat with Jasper in the
library.

3388
02:47:21,061 --> 02:47:32,170
CHAPTER TWENTY ONE
A Visit From Jack Favell

3389
02:47:32,170 --> 02:47:35,290
It was after six when I heard the sound of
Maxim's car.

3390
02:47:35,290 --> 02:47:40,880
I tried to stand up but my legs were so weak
that I had to lean against a chair.

3391
02:47:40,880 --> 02:47:43,271
Maxim came into the room and stood by the
door.

3392
02:47:43,271 --> 02:47:46,061
He looked tired and old.

3393
02:47:46,061 --> 02:47:48,851
'It's all over,' he said.

3394
02:47:48,851 --> 02:47:49,960
I waited.

3395
02:47:49,960 --> 02:47:53,250
I could not speak or walk towards him.

3396
02:47:53,250 --> 02:47:55,830
'Suicide,' Maxim said.

3397
02:47:55,830 --> 02:47:57,950
'That's the verdict.

3398
02:47:57,950 --> 02:48:00,080
They said that Rebecca killed herself.'

3399
02:48:00,080 --> 02:48:02,090
I sat down.

3400
02:48:02,090 --> 02:48:04,090
'Suicide,' I repeated.

3401
02:48:04,090 --> 02:48:07,690
'Why do they think Rebecca did that?'

3402
02:48:07,690 --> 02:48:10,510
'God knows,' Maxim said.

3403
02:48:10,510 --> 02:48:13,511
He went and stood by the window.

3404
02:48:13,511 --> 02:48:15,930
'There's one more thing to be done.

3405
02:48:15,930 --> 02:48:18,820
Rebecca's body has to be buried.

3406
02:48:18,820 --> 02:48:20,490
I'm going down to the church now.

3407
02:48:20,490 --> 02:48:23,150
We'll talk about everything when I get back.

3408
02:48:23,150 --> 02:48:26,290
We've got to start our lives all over again.

3409
02:48:26,290 --> 02:48:30,681
The past can't hurt us if we are together.

3410
02:48:30,681 --> 02:48:32,672
We'll have children too, I promise you.

3411
02:48:32,672 --> 02:48:34,030
I must go now.

3412
02:48:34,030 --> 02:48:37,700
I'm meeting Frank and Colonel Julyan at the
church.'

3413
02:48:37,700 --> 02:48:42,960
He left the room quickly and then I heard
the sound of his car driving away.

3414
02:48:42,960 --> 02:48:43,960
It was quiet in the library.

3415
02:48:43,960 --> 02:48:48,541
I thought about the church where Rebecca was
being buried at last.

3416
02:48:48,541 --> 02:48:52,131
Just before seven, the rain began to fall
heavily.

3417
02:48:52,131 --> 02:48:55,710
I opened the windows to let in the cold, clean
air.

3418
02:48:55,710 --> 02:48:59,271
The rain was falling so heavily that I did
not hear Frith come in.

3419
02:48:59,271 --> 02:49:03,181
'Excuse me, Madam,' he said.

3420
02:49:03,181 --> 02:49:05,870
'There's a gentleman to see Mr de Winter.

3421
02:49:05,870 --> 02:49:08,030
It's Mr Favell.'

3422
02:49:08,030 --> 02:49:10,250
I was very surprised.

3423
02:49:10,250 --> 02:49:14,320
'I think I had better see Mr Favell,' I said.

3424
02:49:14,320 --> 02:49:17,540
'Bring him in here, please, Frith.'

3425
02:49:17,540 --> 02:49:21,000
I hoped that Favell would go before Maxim
came back.

3426
02:49:21,000 --> 02:49:24,471
I could not think why Favell had come.

3427
02:49:24,471 --> 02:49:28,660
'I'm afraid Maxim is not here,' I said, when
Favell walked into the room.

3428
02:49:28,660 --> 02:49:30,960
His eyes were red.

3429
02:49:30,960 --> 02:49:33,160
I wondered if he had been drinking.

3430
02:49:33,160 --> 02:49:37,021
'I don't mind waiting,' Favell replied.

3431
02:49:37,021 --> 02:49:39,101
'Max will be back for dinner, I'm sure.'

3432
02:49:39,101 --> 02:49:40,730
'Mr Favell,' I said.

3433
02:49:40,730 --> 02:49:45,210
'I don't want to be rude, but I am very tired.

3434
02:49:45,210 --> 02:49:47,660
It will be better if you come back in the
morning.'

3435
02:49:47,660 --> 02:49:52,601
'No, no,' he said, coming towards me, 'I've
got something to say to Max.

3436
02:49:52,601 --> 02:49:55,000
This has been a shock to me, you know.

3437
02:49:55,000 --> 02:49:56,530
I was very fond of Rebecca.'

3438
02:49:56,530 --> 02:49:59,210
'Yes, of course,' I said.

3439
02:49:59,210 --> 02:50:00,940
'I'm very sorry for you.'

3440
02:50:00,940 --> 02:50:05,890
'I was fonder of Rebecca than of anyone else
in the world,' Favell went on.

3441
02:50:05,890 --> 02:50:07,590
'And she was fond of me.

3442
02:50:07,590 --> 02:50:11,021
That's why I've come here to find out the
truth.

3443
02:50:11,021 --> 02:50:12,391
Suicide...

3444
02:50:12,391 --> 02:50:14,000
my God.

3445
02:50:14,000 --> 02:50:17,400
You and I know it wasn't suicide, don't we?'

3446
02:50:17,400 --> 02:50:21,171
As Favell was speaking, the door opened and
Maxim and Frank came in.

3447
02:50:21,171 --> 02:50:24,500
'What the hell are you doing here?'

3448
02:50:24,500 --> 02:50:26,021
Maxim said to Favell.

3449
02:50:26,021 --> 02:50:29,500
'Why, hello, Max, old man,' Favell said.

3450
02:50:29,500 --> 02:50:33,460
'You must be feeling very pleased with yourself.'

3451
02:50:33,460 --> 02:50:36,860
'Do you mind leaving the house?' said Maxim
coldly.

3452
02:50:36,860 --> 02:50:39,540
'I don't want you here.'

3453
02:50:39,540 --> 02:50:43,220
'Now, wait a minute, Max,' Favell answered.

3454
02:50:43,220 --> 02:50:45,460
'You've been very lucky.

3455
02:50:45,460 --> 02:50:47,921
But I can still make life unpleasant for you.

3456
02:50:47,921 --> 02:50:50,420
And dangerous too, perhaps.'

3457
02:50:50,420 --> 02:50:52,150
Maxim stared hard at Favell.

3458
02:50:52,150 --> 02:50:54,330
'Oh yes?' he said.

3459
02:50:54,330 --> 02:50:57,860
'In what way can you make things dangerous?'

3460
02:50:57,860 --> 02:51:03,320
'I'll tell you, Max,' said Favell with an
unpleasant smile.

3461
02:51:03,320 --> 02:51:06,421
'You know all about Rebecca and me.

3462
02:51:06,421 --> 02:51:07,610
Her death was a great shock.

3463
02:51:07,610 --> 02:51:11,710
Then I read about Rebecca's boat and the body
in the cabin.

3464
02:51:11,710 --> 02:51:12,880
So I went to the inquest.

3465
02:51:12,880 --> 02:51:15,240
I heard the boat-builder's evidence.

3466
02:51:15,240 --> 02:51:18,320
What about those holes in the boat, Max?'

3467
02:51:18,320 --> 02:51:21,561
'You heard the verdict,' Maxim told him.

3468
02:51:21,561 --> 02:51:23,080
'I have nothing more to say.'

3469
02:51:23,080 --> 02:51:24,080
Favell laughed.

3470
02:51:24,080 --> 02:51:26,040
'You know Rebecca didn't kill herself.

3471
02:51:26,040 --> 02:51:30,510
I've a note here that may interest you.

3472
02:51:30,510 --> 02:51:34,070
I kept it because it was the last thing Rebecca
ever wrote to me.

3473
02:51:34,070 --> 02:51:35,090
Listen.'

3474
02:51:35,090 --> 02:51:38,160
Favell took a piece of paper from his pocket.

3475
02:51:38,160 --> 02:51:41,590
I recognized Rebecca's hard, black writing.

3476
02:51:41,590 --> 02:51:45,870
"I tried to phone you," Favell read, "but
you were out.

3477
02:51:45,870 --> 02:51:49,160
I'm leaving London now and going back to Manderley.

3478
02:51:49,160 --> 02:51:51,290
I'll wait for you in the cottage.

3479
02:51:51,290 --> 02:51:52,730
Come down as soon as you can.

3480
02:51:52,730 --> 02:51:55,460
I've got something to tell you."

3481
02:51:55,460 --> 02:51:56,460
'

3482
02:51:56,460 --> 02:51:58,170
Favell put the note back in his pocket.

3483
02:51:58,170 --> 02:52:00,710
'I found that in my London flat.

3484
02:52:00,710 --> 02:52:03,500
It was too late to drive down to Manderley.

3485
02:52:03,500 --> 02:52:06,440
When I phoned the following day, Rebecca was
dead.

3486
02:52:06,440 --> 02:52:11,690
Do you really think Rebecca killed herself
after writing that note?'

3487
02:52:11,690 --> 02:52:12,690
Maxim said nothing.

3488
02:52:12,690 --> 02:52:19,920
'Now, Max, old man,' Favell said at last,
'you know I'm not a rich man.

3489
02:52:19,920 --> 02:52:24,690
If I had two or three thousand pounds, I could
live quite well.

3490
02:52:24,690 --> 02:52:27,980
I'd never come back, I promise you.'

3491
02:52:27,980 --> 02:52:31,670
'I've already asked you to leave the house,'
Maxim said.

3492
02:52:31,670 --> 02:52:34,040
'The door is behind you.'

3493
02:52:34,040 --> 02:52:35,870
Favell laughed again.

3494
02:52:35,870 --> 02:52:39,521
'Think again, Max,' said Favell.

3495
02:52:39,521 --> 02:52:44,640
'I don't suppose your new bride wants to be
known as the wife of a murderer.'

3496
02:52:44,640 --> 02:52:47,221
'You can't frighten me, Favell,' Maxim answered.

3497
02:52:47,221 --> 02:52:49,990
'Shall I phone Colonel Julyan?

3498
02:52:49,990 --> 02:52:51,761
You can tell your story to him.'

3499
02:52:51,761 --> 02:52:54,920
'You wouldn't dare, Max,' said Favell.

3500
02:52:54,920 --> 02:52:59,760
'I have enough evidence to hang you, Max.'

3501
02:52:59,760 --> 02:53:02,920
Maxim walked slowly towards the telephone
in the next room.

3502
02:53:02,920 --> 02:53:04,670
'Stop him,' I said to Frank.

3503
02:53:04,670 --> 02:53:05,670
'Stop him for God's sake.'

3504
02:53:05,670 --> 02:53:07,421
But it was too late.

3505
02:53:07,421 --> 02:53:09,050
Maxim was already speaking.

3506
02:53:09,050 --> 02:53:11,460
'Is that Colonel Julyan?

3507
02:53:11,460 --> 02:53:12,460
It's de Winter here.

3508
02:53:12,460 --> 02:53:14,900
Could you come over to Manderley at once?

3509
02:53:14,900 --> 02:53:18,700
No - I can't say anything over the phone.

3510
02:53:18,700 --> 02:53:21,851
Thank you very much, goodbye.'

3511
02:53:21,851 --> 02:53:23,851
Maxim came back again into the room.

3512
02:53:23,851 --> 02:53:26,811
'Colonel Julyan will be here in ten minutes,'
he said.

3513
02:53:26,811 --> 02:53:27,960
We waited in silence.

3514
02:53:27,960 --> 02:53:32,771
The rain was so heavy that we did not hear
the sound of the car.

3515
02:53:32,771 --> 02:53:37,120
We were taken by surprise when Frith brought
the magistrate into the library.

3516
02:53:37,120 --> 02:53:40,830
'Good evening, Colonel Julyan,' Maxim said
at once.

3517
02:53:40,830 --> 02:53:44,211
'This is Jack Favell, my late wife's cousin.

3518
02:53:44,211 --> 02:53:46,830
He has something to say to you.'

3519
02:53:46,830 --> 02:53:49,410
Favell went up to Colonel Julyan.

3520
02:53:49,410 --> 02:53:51,140
'I'm not happy about the verdict.

3521
02:53:51,140 --> 02:53:53,670
I want you to read this note.

3522
02:53:53,670 --> 02:53:57,790
Tell me whether you think the writer had decided
to kill herself.'

3523
02:53:57,790 --> 02:54:01,510
Colonel Julyan took the note and read it slowly.

3524
02:54:01,510 --> 02:54:03,870
'I see what you mean,' he said.

3525
02:54:03,870 --> 02:54:06,000
'But the note is not clear.

3526
02:54:06,000 --> 02:54:09,570
What do you think really happened to Mrs de
Winter?'

3527
02:54:09,570 --> 02:54:13,000
Favell looked at Maxim.

3528
02:54:13,000 --> 02:54:17,101
'I'll tell you what I think,' he said slowly.

3529
02:54:17,101 --> 02:54:18,891
'Rebecca never opened those sea-cocks.

3530
02:54:18,891 --> 02:54:21,631
She didn't make those holes in the boat.

3531
02:54:21,631 --> 02:54:23,420
Rebecca didn't kill herself.

3532
02:54:23,420 --> 02:54:24,690
I say she was murdered.

3533
02:54:24,690 --> 02:54:27,950
Do you want to know who the murderer is?

3534
02:54:27,950 --> 02:54:31,320
He's there, standing by the window.

3535
02:54:31,320 --> 02:54:34,790
Mr Maximilian de Winter - he's your murderer.

3536
02:54:34,790 --> 02:54:37,760
Take a good look at him.'

3537
02:54:37,760 --> 02:54:44,000
Favell began to laugh, a high stupid laugh,
as he twisted the note round and round in

3538
02:54:44,000 --> 02:54:50,370
his fingers.

3539
02:54:50,370 --> 02:55:06,301
CHAPTER TWENTY TWO
Rebecca's Diary

3540
02:55:06,301 --> 02:55:07,910
Thank God for Favell's laugh.

3541
02:55:07,910 --> 02:55:11,551
I saw a look of disgust come into Colonel
Julyan's face.

3542
02:55:11,551 --> 02:55:14,240
'The man's drunk,' he said quickly.

3543
02:55:14,240 --> 02:55:16,400
'He doesn't know what he's saying.'

3544
02:55:16,400 --> 02:55:18,851
'Drunk, am I?' shouted Favell.

3545
02:55:18,851 --> 02:55:21,640
'Oh no, I'm not drunk.

3546
02:55:21,640 --> 02:55:24,771
Max de Winter murdered Rebecca, and I'm going
to prove it.'

3547
02:55:24,771 --> 02:55:27,601
'Wait a minute,' said Colonel Julyan.

3548
02:55:27,601 --> 02:55:30,431
'I want to hear your proof.'

3549
02:55:30,431 --> 02:55:32,561
'Proof?' said Favell.

3550
02:55:32,561 --> 02:55:36,840
'Aren't those holes in the boat enough proof
for you?'

3551
02:55:36,840 --> 02:55:39,410
'Certainly not,' said Colonel Julyan.

3552
02:55:39,410 --> 02:55:42,570
'Unless you can find someone who saw him do
it.'

3553
02:55:42,570 --> 02:55:46,740
'I'll get your proof for you,' shouted Favell.

3554
02:55:46,740 --> 02:55:49,680
'De Winter killed Rebecca because of me.

3555
02:55:49,680 --> 02:55:53,170
He was jealous because she loved me.

3556
02:55:53,170 --> 02:55:56,051
He went down to the cottage and killed her
there.

3557
02:55:56,051 --> 02:55:57,391
Wait a minute...

3558
02:55:57,391 --> 02:56:00,230
I think I can find someone who saw him.'

3559
02:56:00,230 --> 02:56:03,110
I suddenly knew what Favell meant.

3560
02:56:03,110 --> 02:56:07,801
Someone had seen it all happen - someone who
was often down there in the bay - Ben.

3561
02:56:07,801 --> 02:56:13,200
'There's an idiot who was always around the
cottage,' Favell said.

3562
02:56:13,200 --> 02:56:15,210
'He often slept on the beach.

3563
02:56:15,210 --> 02:56:17,771
I'm sure he saw everything.'

3564
02:56:17,771 --> 02:56:21,840
'Can we get this man and question him?' asked
Colonel Julyan.

3565
02:56:21,840 --> 02:56:24,420
'Of course,' said Maxim.

3566
02:56:24,420 --> 02:56:26,990
'His name is Ben.

3567
02:56:26,990 --> 02:56:29,000
Could you go and get him, Frank?

3568
02:56:29,000 --> 02:56:30,101
Take your car.'

3569
02:56:30,101 --> 02:56:31,490
Frank went out quickly.

3570
02:56:31,490 --> 02:56:33,370
Favell laughed angrily.

3571
02:56:33,370 --> 02:56:35,550
His face was very red.

3572
02:56:35,550 --> 02:56:40,490
'You all help each other down here, don't
you?' he said.

3573
02:56:40,490 --> 02:56:42,220
'Crawley knows the truth, I'm sure.

3574
02:56:42,220 --> 02:56:45,271
He'll be there to hold the young bride's arm
when Max is sentenced to death.'

3575
02:56:45,271 --> 02:56:50,311
Without warning, Maxim went up to Favell and
hit him hard.

3576
02:56:50,311 --> 02:56:52,851
Favell fell heavily to the floor.

3577
02:56:52,851 --> 02:56:54,940
I wished that Maxim had not hit him.

3578
02:56:54,940 --> 02:56:59,841
Favell got slowly to his feet, walked over
to a small table and poured himself some whisky.

3579
02:56:59,841 --> 02:57:04,150
I saw Colonel Julyan look thoughtfully at
Maxim.

3580
02:57:04,150 --> 02:57:06,470
Was he beginning to believe Favell's story?

3581
02:57:06,470 --> 02:57:08,601
The door opened and Frank came in.

3582
02:57:08,601 --> 02:57:12,860
'All right, Ben,' he said quietly.

3583
02:57:12,860 --> 02:57:13,860
'Don't be frightened.'

3584
02:57:13,860 --> 02:57:18,271
Ben stepped into the room and stared at everyone
with his small eyes.

3585
02:57:18,271 --> 02:57:20,440
Favell walked up to him.

3586
02:57:20,440 --> 02:57:24,440
'You know who I am, don't you?' he said.

3587
02:57:24,440 --> 02:57:26,221
Ben did not answer.

3588
02:57:26,221 --> 02:57:28,010
'Come on,' said Favell.

3589
02:57:28,010 --> 02:57:30,320
'You've seen me in the cottage, haven't you?'

3590
02:57:30,320 --> 02:57:32,670
Ben held Frank's arm.

3591
02:57:32,670 --> 02:57:35,500
'I've never seen him,' he said.

3592
02:57:35,500 --> 02:57:38,540
'Is he going to take me away?'

3593
02:57:38,540 --> 02:57:42,110
'No, of course not,' said Colonel Julyan.

3594
02:57:42,110 --> 02:57:44,440
'Now listen to me, Ben.

3595
02:57:44,440 --> 02:57:46,470
You remember the lady with the boat.

3596
02:57:46,470 --> 02:57:51,011
Were you on the beach when she took her boat
out for the last time?'

3597
02:57:51,011 --> 02:57:55,940
'You were there, weren't you?' said Favell,
standing over Ben.

3598
02:57:55,940 --> 02:58:00,561
'You saw Mrs de Winter go into the cottage
and Mr de Winter too.

3599
02:58:00,561 --> 02:58:02,101
What happened then?'

3600
02:58:02,101 --> 02:58:06,240
Ben shook his head and moved back against
the wall.

3601
02:58:06,240 --> 02:58:09,250
'I didn't see anything,' he said.

3602
02:58:09,250 --> 02:58:10,650
He began to cry.

3603
02:58:10,650 --> 02:58:16,780
'You damned little idiot,' Favell said slowly.

3604
02:58:16,780 --> 02:58:20,910
'I think Ben can go home now, don't you, Colonel
Julyan?'

3605
02:58:20,910 --> 02:58:22,900
Maxim said.

3606
02:58:22,900 --> 02:58:25,880
Frank took Ben out of the room as the Colonel
nodded his head.

3607
02:58:25,880 --> 02:58:29,601
'That poor fellow was terrified,' he said.

3608
02:58:29,601 --> 02:58:31,580
'He's no use to you, Favell.

3609
02:58:31,580 --> 02:58:35,330
I'm afraid you can't prove your story.'

3610
02:58:35,330 --> 02:58:36,430
Favell did not answer.

3611
02:58:36,430 --> 02:58:42,740
Instead, he rang the bell and when Frith came
in, he said, 'Ask Mrs Danvers to come here,

3612
02:58:42,740 --> 02:58:43,740
Frith.'

3613
02:58:43,740 --> 02:58:46,840
'Isn't Mrs Danvers the housekeeper?'

3614
02:58:46,840 --> 02:58:49,390
asked Colonel Julyan as Frith left the room.

3615
02:58:49,390 --> 02:58:52,771
'She was also Rebecca's friend.

3616
02:58:52,771 --> 02:58:57,090
She knew her for years,' Favell said, with
his unpleasant smile.

3617
02:58:57,090 --> 02:58:59,680
We all waited, watching the door.

3618
02:58:59,680 --> 02:59:02,960
Then Mrs Danvers came in and shut the door
behind her.

3619
02:59:02,960 --> 02:59:06,931
'Good evening, Mrs Danvers,' Colonel Julyan
said.

3620
02:59:06,931 --> 02:59:10,240
'I would like to ask you a question.

3621
02:59:10,240 --> 02:59:12,680
You knew the late Mrs de Winter well.

3622
02:59:12,680 --> 02:59:17,320
Mr Favell has told us that Mrs de Winter was
in love with him.

3623
02:59:17,320 --> 02:59:18,521
Is that true?'

3624
02:59:18,521 --> 02:59:22,860
'No, it is not,' Mrs Danvers answered.

3625
02:59:22,860 --> 02:59:28,530
'Now, listen, Danny,' Favell began to shout,
but Mrs Danvers took no notice.

3626
02:59:28,530 --> 02:59:31,510
'She was not in love with you, Mr Jack.

3627
02:59:31,510 --> 02:59:32,870
Or with Mr de Winter.

3628
02:59:32,870 --> 02:59:35,141
She was not in love with anyone.

3629
02:59:35,141 --> 02:59:37,330
She thought men were fools.

3630
02:59:37,330 --> 02:59:39,880
She amused herself with you, that was all.'

3631
02:59:39,880 --> 02:59:42,610
Maxim went very white.

3632
02:59:42,610 --> 02:59:46,780
Favell stared at Mrs Danvers as though he
did not understand her.

3633
02:59:46,780 --> 02:59:53,460
'Mrs Danvers,' Colonel Julyan said quietly,
'can you think of any reason why Mrs de Winter

3634
02:59:53,460 --> 02:59:55,381
killed herself?'

3635
02:59:55,381 --> 02:59:57,771
Mrs Danvers shook her head.

3636
02:59:57,771 --> 03:00:00,690
'No, certainly not,' she said.

3637
03:00:00,690 --> 03:00:02,561
'There you are!

3638
03:00:02,561 --> 03:00:04,260
What did I tell you?'

3639
03:00:04,260 --> 03:00:05,260
Favell shouted.

3640
03:00:05,260 --> 03:00:06,790
'Be quiet, will you.

3641
03:00:06,790 --> 03:00:09,000
Let Mrs Danvers read the note.

3642
03:00:09,000 --> 03:00:11,900
She may understand it,' Colonel Julyan said.

3643
03:00:11,900 --> 03:00:16,561
Mrs Danvers took the note, read it and then
shook her head again.

3644
03:00:16,561 --> 03:00:18,811
'I don't know what she meant.

3645
03:00:18,811 --> 03:00:22,551
If it was something important, she would have
told me.'

3646
03:00:22,551 --> 03:00:26,890
'Can you tell us how Mrs de Winter spent that
last day in London?

3647
03:00:26,890 --> 03:00:29,351
Did she keep a diary?'

3648
03:00:29,351 --> 03:00:31,630
asked Colonel Julyan.

3649
03:00:31,630 --> 03:00:34,931
'I've got her diary in my room,' Mrs Danvers
replied.

3650
03:00:34,931 --> 03:00:37,300
'I kept all her things.

3651
03:00:37,300 --> 03:00:38,690
I'll go and get it.'

3652
03:00:38,690 --> 03:00:44,851
'Well, de Winter,' said Colonel Julyan, 'do
you mind us seeing this diary?'

3653
03:00:44,851 --> 03:00:47,900
'Of course not,' said Maxim.

3654
03:00:47,900 --> 03:00:52,180
Once again, I saw Colonel Julyan give Maxim
a hard look.

3655
03:00:52,180 --> 03:00:55,430
This time Frank saw it too.

3656
03:00:55,430 --> 03:00:59,351
Somehow I felt sure that the truth was in
that diary.

3657
03:00:59,351 --> 03:01:02,540
Mrs Danvers came back with a small book in
her hand.

3658
03:01:02,540 --> 03:01:06,830
'Here is the page for the day Mrs de Winter
died,' she said.

3659
03:01:06,830 --> 03:01:09,561
Colonel Julyan looked at it carefully.

3660
03:01:09,561 --> 03:01:12,900
'Yes,' he said, 'here it is.

3661
03:01:12,900 --> 03:01:15,141
Hairdressers at twelve o'clock.

3662
03:01:15,141 --> 03:01:16,240
Then lunch.

3663
03:01:16,240 --> 03:01:19,610
And then - Baker - two o'clock.

3664
03:01:19,610 --> 03:01:22,030
Who was Baker?'

3665
03:01:22,030 --> 03:01:23,800
He looked at Maxim.

3666
03:01:23,800 --> 03:01:25,420
Maxim shook his head.

3667
03:01:25,420 --> 03:01:26,420
'Baker?'

3668
03:01:26,420 --> 03:01:28,250
repeated Mrs Danvers.

3669
03:01:28,250 --> 03:01:29,990
'She knew no one called Baker.'

3670
03:01:29,990 --> 03:01:34,860
'We must find out who this person was,' said
Colonel Julyan.

3671
03:01:34,860 --> 03:01:39,720
'If he wasn't a friend, perhaps it was someone
she was afraid of.'

3672
03:01:39,720 --> 03:01:43,570
'Mrs de Winter afraid?' said Mrs Danvers.

3673
03:01:43,570 --> 03:01:45,961
'She was afraid of nothing and no one.

3674
03:01:45,961 --> 03:01:48,790
Only one thing worried her.

3675
03:01:48,790 --> 03:01:53,351
That was the thought of illness, of dying
slowly in her bed.'

3676
03:01:53,351 --> 03:01:56,690
'What does all this matter?' said Favell.

3677
03:01:56,690 --> 03:02:00,480
'If Baker was important Danny would know about
him.'

3678
03:02:00,480 --> 03:02:03,120
Mrs Danvers was turning the pages of the diary.

3679
03:02:03,120 --> 03:02:06,820
'There's a telephone number here at the back,'
she said.

3680
03:02:06,820 --> 03:02:08,311
'And the name Baker again.'

3681
03:02:08,311 --> 03:02:12,750
'Well,' said Maxim, lighting a cigarette.

3682
03:02:12,750 --> 03:02:14,980
'Perhaps someone should phone that number.

3683
03:02:14,980 --> 03:02:17,860
Would you mind, Frank?'

3684
03:02:17,860 --> 03:02:20,940
Frank took the diary without a word and went
into the next room.

3685
03:02:20,940 --> 03:02:23,540
He shut the door behind him.

3686
03:02:23,540 --> 03:02:28,130
When he came back, he said, 'That was a doctor's
number.

3687
03:02:28,130 --> 03:02:30,931
Dr Baker used to live there, but he left six
months ago.

3688
03:02:30,931 --> 03:02:33,890
They gave me his new address.

3689
03:02:33,890 --> 03:02:35,960
I have written it here.'

3690
03:02:35,960 --> 03:02:38,730
And Frank held out a piece of paper.

3691
03:02:38,730 --> 03:02:41,230
It was then that Maxim looked at me.

3692
03:02:41,230 --> 03:02:45,330
He looked at me like a man saying goodbye
for the last time.

3693
03:02:45,330 --> 03:02:49,580
That piece of paper was enough to hang Maxim.

3694
03:02:49,580 --> 03:02:52,110
I knew why Rebecca had gone to a doctor.

3695
03:02:52,110 --> 03:02:55,061
I knew what she had wanted to tell Favell.

3696
03:02:55,061 --> 03:02:56,690
Rebecca had been pregnant when she died.

3697
03:02:56,690 --> 03:02:58,910
She had been going to have a child.

3698
03:02:58,910 --> 03:03:04,271
It was the one clear proof that Rebecca had
not killed herself.

3699
03:03:04,271 --> 03:03:06,561
I was sure that this was the truth.

3700
03:03:06,561 --> 03:03:09,061
I knew Maxim thought so too.

3701
03:03:09,061 --> 03:03:12,181
'Well done, Frank,' said Maxim calmly.

3702
03:03:12,181 --> 03:03:15,150
'Where does the doctor live now?'

3703
03:03:15,150 --> 03:03:17,660
'In north London,' Frank replied.

3704
03:03:17,660 --> 03:03:21,170
'But he's not on the phone.

3705
03:03:21,170 --> 03:03:22,921
He's a very well-known women's doctor.'

3706
03:03:22,921 --> 03:03:25,730
'Well,' said Colonel Julyan.

3707
03:03:25,730 --> 03:03:28,390
'There must have been something wrong with
her after all.'

3708
03:03:28,390 --> 03:03:31,891
'I'll write him a letter,' Frank said.

3709
03:03:31,891 --> 03:03:35,960
'I don't think he would tell you anything,'
Colonel Julyan answered.

3710
03:03:35,960 --> 03:03:38,590
'I think de Winter should see him and explain.'

3711
03:03:38,590 --> 03:03:43,220
'I'm ready to go,' said Maxim quietly.

3712
03:03:43,220 --> 03:03:45,931
'Shall I go up in the morning?'

3713
03:03:45,931 --> 03:03:49,160
'He's not going alone,' Favell said with a
laugh.

3714
03:03:49,160 --> 03:03:50,391
'You go with him, Julyan.

3715
03:03:50,391 --> 03:03:52,290
And I think I'd better go too.

3716
03:03:52,290 --> 03:03:54,061
What time do we start?'

3717
03:03:54,061 --> 03:03:56,400
Colonel Julyan looked at Maxim.

3718
03:03:56,400 --> 03:03:58,381
'Nine o'clock?' he said.

3719
03:03:58,381 --> 03:04:00,730
'Perhaps you will take me in your car.'

3720
03:04:00,730 --> 03:04:05,450
'We'll meet at the crossroads just after nine,'
Favell said.

3721
03:04:05,450 --> 03:04:06,450
He walked to the door.

3722
03:04:06,450 --> 03:04:10,260
'I suppose you're not going to ask me to dinner,
so I'll say goodbye.

3723
03:04:10,260 --> 03:04:12,040
Come on, Danny.

3724
03:04:12,040 --> 03:04:14,910
I'll see you in the morning, Max.'

3725
03:04:14,910 --> 03:04:17,700
Colonel Julyan came up to me and took my hand.

3726
03:04:17,700 --> 03:04:19,921
'Good night,' he said.

3727
03:04:19,921 --> 03:04:21,840
'Get your husband to bed early.

3728
03:04:21,840 --> 03:04:24,970
Tomorrow will be a long day.'

3729
03:04:24,970 --> 03:04:28,271
He held my hand for a moment, but he did not
look into my eyes.

3730
03:04:28,271 --> 03:04:31,500
He and Frank went out together.

3731
03:04:31,500 --> 03:04:33,471
Maxim and I were alone at last.

3732
03:04:33,471 --> 03:04:38,130
'I'm coming with you tomorrow,' I said.

3733
03:04:38,130 --> 03:04:39,690
'Yes,' Maxim answered.

3734
03:04:39,690 --> 03:04:43,500
'We must be together as long as we can.'

3735
03:04:43,500 --> 03:04:45,800
I put my arms around him and held him.

3736
03:04:45,800 --> 03:04:47,730
We did not say anything.

3737
03:04:47,730 --> 03:04:49,990
Then Maxim held me tightly.

3738
03:04:49,990 --> 03:05:11,210
We began to kiss each other, like guilty lovers
who had never kissed before.

3739
03:05:11,210 --> 03:05:15,240
CHAPTER TWENTY THREE
Dr Baker

3740
03:05:15,240 --> 03:05:18,021
I woke up early the following morning at about
six o'clock.

3741
03:05:18,021 --> 03:05:19,840
I got up and went to the window.

3742
03:05:19,840 --> 03:05:22,160
The trees were covered in mist.

3743
03:05:22,160 --> 03:05:24,910
There was a sharp coolness in the air.

3744
03:05:24,910 --> 03:05:26,800
Autumn had arrived.

3745
03:05:26,800 --> 03:05:30,890
This was the start of a new day at Manderley.

3746
03:05:30,890 --> 03:05:33,820
Soon the servants would be starting work.

3747
03:05:33,820 --> 03:05:37,000
Whatever happened to us, life at Manderley
would go on.

3748
03:05:37,000 --> 03:05:40,630
The peace of Manderley could not be broken.

3749
03:05:40,630 --> 03:05:43,050
Its beauty could not be destroyed.

3750
03:05:43,050 --> 03:05:47,090
The flowers would come every year, the birds
would sing.

3751
03:05:47,090 --> 03:05:52,070
Manderley would always be here, safe and secure,
within sound of the sea.

3752
03:05:52,070 --> 03:05:54,380
Maxim slept on and I did not wake him.

3753
03:05:54,380 --> 03:05:57,680
The day ahead would be long and tiring.

3754
03:05:57,680 --> 03:05:59,120
London was many miles away.

3755
03:05:59,120 --> 03:06:03,990
We did not know what we should find at the
end of the journey.

3756
03:06:03,990 --> 03:06:07,131
Somewhere in London lived a man called Baker.

3757
03:06:07,131 --> 03:06:08,530
He had never heard of us.

3758
03:06:08,530 --> 03:06:11,561
But our future was in his hands.

3759
03:06:11,561 --> 03:06:14,261
I had a bath, dressed and then woke Maxim.

3760
03:06:14,261 --> 03:06:16,590
He got up and went into the bathroom.

3761
03:06:16,590 --> 03:06:19,080
I began to pack a few things.

3762
03:06:19,080 --> 03:06:22,410
We might have to stay overnight in London.

3763
03:06:22,410 --> 03:06:24,180
I looked at my small case.

3764
03:06:24,180 --> 03:06:26,061
It seemed so long since I had used it.

3765
03:06:26,061 --> 03:06:29,030
But it was only four months.

3766
03:06:29,030 --> 03:06:31,920
I could not believe it.

3767
03:06:31,920 --> 03:06:34,311
We had breakfast together and I went out on
to the terrace.

3768
03:06:34,311 --> 03:06:37,180
The air was fresh and clear now.

3769
03:06:37,180 --> 03:06:39,690
It was going to be a perfect day.

3770
03:06:39,690 --> 03:06:43,771
At nine o'clock exactly, Frank brought up
Colonel Julyan in his car.

3771
03:06:43,771 --> 03:06:46,480
We were going in Maxim's car.

3772
03:06:46,480 --> 03:06:49,641
I sat beside Maxim and Colonel Julyan got
into the back.

3773
03:06:49,641 --> 03:06:52,570
'You will telephone, won't you?'

3774
03:06:52,570 --> 03:06:54,211
Frank said as he stood on the steps.

3775
03:06:54,211 --> 03:06:56,811
'Yes, of course,' Maxim said.

3776
03:06:56,811 --> 03:06:59,910
As we drove away, I looked back at the house.

3777
03:06:59,910 --> 03:07:02,010
It had never looked more beautiful.

3778
03:07:02,010 --> 03:07:05,220
For some reason, my eyes filled with tears.

3779
03:07:05,220 --> 03:07:10,021
Then we were round the bend of the drive and
I could see the house no longer.

3780
03:07:10,021 --> 03:07:14,370
When we came to the crossroads, Favell was
already waiting.

3781
03:07:14,370 --> 03:07:16,870
He waved when he saw us and started up his
car.

3782
03:07:16,870 --> 03:07:20,440
I settled down for the long journey to London.

3783
03:07:20,440 --> 03:07:25,750
The hours passed and the miles went by, Favell's
car always behind us.

3784
03:07:25,750 --> 03:07:29,550
We had lunch somewhere and reached London
at about three o'clock.

3785
03:07:29,550 --> 03:07:32,091
It was then that I began to feel tired.

3786
03:07:32,091 --> 03:07:35,761
It was warm and the streets were busy.

3787
03:07:35,761 --> 03:07:39,130
The drive through the centre of London seemed
very long.

3788
03:07:39,130 --> 03:07:42,271
Maxim looked pale and tired, but he did not
say anything.

3789
03:07:42,271 --> 03:07:45,530
Favell's car was always behind us.

3790
03:07:45,530 --> 03:07:49,410
We reached Baker's house at about five o'clock.

3791
03:07:49,410 --> 03:07:51,380
Maxim stopped the car and we got out.

3792
03:07:51,380 --> 03:07:53,061
Favell came up to meet us.

3793
03:07:53,061 --> 03:07:56,330
We all walked slowly up the path to the front
door.

3794
03:07:56,330 --> 03:07:58,811
Colonel Julyan rang the bell.

3795
03:07:58,811 --> 03:08:01,190
A woman opened the door.

3796
03:08:01,190 --> 03:08:04,811
'Is Dr Baker at home?' said Colonel Julyan.

3797
03:08:04,811 --> 03:08:06,131
'He is expecting us.

3798
03:08:06,131 --> 03:08:07,230
I sent a telegram.'

3799
03:08:07,230 --> 03:08:10,580
'Yes, of course,' said the woman.

3800
03:08:10,580 --> 03:08:12,570
'My husband is in the garden.

3801
03:08:12,570 --> 03:08:15,641
I'll tell him you are here.'

3802
03:08:15,641 --> 03:08:18,680
She took us into a cool room at the back of
the house.

3803
03:08:18,680 --> 03:08:23,181
She went out and in a few minutes a tall man
came into the room.

3804
03:08:23,181 --> 03:08:24,240
'I'm Dr Baker.

3805
03:08:24,240 --> 03:08:26,300
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

3806
03:08:26,300 --> 03:08:28,421
Please sit down,' he said.

3807
03:08:28,421 --> 03:08:33,181
'We are sorry to trouble you, Dr Baker,' Colonel
Julyan said.

3808
03:08:33,181 --> 03:08:34,980
'My name is Julyan.

3809
03:08:34,980 --> 03:08:39,320
This is Mr de Winter, Mrs de Winter and Mr
Favell.

3810
03:08:39,320 --> 03:08:42,690
We have come about the death of the late Mrs
de Winter.

3811
03:08:42,690 --> 03:08:45,010
You may have read the report in the papers.'

3812
03:08:45,010 --> 03:08:48,240
'The verdict was suicide,' Favell said.

3813
03:08:48,240 --> 03:08:50,471
'I knew Mrs de Winter very well.

3814
03:08:50,471 --> 03:08:51,650
She did not kill herself.

3815
03:08:51,650 --> 03:08:53,340
She had no reason to.

3816
03:08:53,340 --> 03:08:58,110
We want to know why she came to see you on
the day she died.'

3817
03:08:58,110 --> 03:08:59,570
Dr Baker looked surprised.

3818
03:08:59,570 --> 03:09:02,870
'I think you've made a mistake,' he said.

3819
03:09:02,870 --> 03:09:06,300
'No one called de Winter has ever come to
me.'

3820
03:09:06,300 --> 03:09:11,780
'But we found your old telephone number in
Mrs de Winter's diary.'

3821
03:09:11,780 --> 03:09:15,811
Dr Baker looked at the page from the diary
that Colonel Julyan was holding out to him.

3822
03:09:15,811 --> 03:09:19,740
'That certainly was my number,' he said.

3823
03:09:19,740 --> 03:09:24,820
'Perhaps Mrs de Winter gave you a different
name,' Colonel Julyan suggested.

3824
03:09:24,820 --> 03:09:28,811
'It's possible,' said Dr Baker slowly.

3825
03:09:28,811 --> 03:09:33,010
'If you have any record of a visit on that
day, could we see it?'

3826
03:09:33,010 --> 03:09:34,561
Colonel Julyan asked.

3827
03:09:34,561 --> 03:09:36,330
'This is an important matter.'

3828
03:09:36,330 --> 03:09:37,330
'Murder,' Favell said.

3829
03:09:37,330 --> 03:09:39,490
'Of course,' said the doctor.

3830
03:09:39,490 --> 03:09:44,601
'I had no idea there was any question of that.

3831
03:09:44,601 --> 03:09:47,501
I'll go and get my book.'

3832
03:09:47,501 --> 03:09:50,470
While Dr Baker was out of the room, we said
nothing.

3833
03:09:50,470 --> 03:09:52,240
No one looked at anyone else.

3834
03:09:52,240 --> 03:09:55,420
Favell whistled quietly under his breath.

3835
03:09:55,420 --> 03:09:59,050
Dr Baker came back into the room with a large
book.

3836
03:09:59,050 --> 03:10:01,840
He opened the book and turned the pages.

3837
03:10:01,840 --> 03:10:03,830
We all stood watching his face.

3838
03:10:03,830 --> 03:10:10,771
'I saw a Mrs Danvers on the 12th at two o'clock,'
Dr Baker said at last.

3839
03:10:10,771 --> 03:10:11,771
'Danny?

3840
03:10:11,771 --> 03:10:13,200
Why did...?'

3841
03:10:13,200 --> 03:10:14,830
Favell began.

3842
03:10:14,830 --> 03:10:16,521
Maxim broke in.

3843
03:10:16,521 --> 03:10:19,090
'Rebecca gave the wrong name, of course,'
he said.

3844
03:10:19,090 --> 03:10:22,160
'Do you remember the visit now, Doctor?'

3845
03:10:22,160 --> 03:10:25,311
But Dr Baker was already searching his files.

3846
03:10:25,311 --> 03:10:27,700
He picked out a card and read it.

3847
03:10:27,700 --> 03:10:32,170
'Yes,' he said slowly, 'I remember now.'

3848
03:10:32,170 --> 03:10:35,870
'Was she tall and dark, a beautiful woman?'

3849
03:10:35,870 --> 03:10:37,921
Colonel Julyan asked.

3850
03:10:37,921 --> 03:10:40,680
'Yes,' said Dr Baker.

3851
03:10:40,680 --> 03:10:43,570
He put back the card and looked at Maxim.

3852
03:10:43,570 --> 03:10:45,490
The doctor spoke slowly.

3853
03:10:45,490 --> 03:10:51,230
'The woman who called herself Mrs Danvers
was very ill indeed.

3854
03:10:51,230 --> 03:10:53,521
She had come to me the week before.

3855
03:10:53,521 --> 03:10:55,600
I took some X-rays.

3856
03:10:55,600 --> 03:10:57,400
She had come back to hear the result.

3857
03:10:57,400 --> 03:11:00,340
I remember her words exactly.

3858
03:11:00,340 --> 03:11:02,870
"I want to know the truth," she said.

3859
03:11:02,870 --> 03:11:06,610
"If I'm really ill, I want to know."

3860
03:11:06,610 --> 03:11:08,110
So I told her.'

3861
03:11:08,110 --> 03:11:11,140
Dr Baker stopped and looked down at the files.

3862
03:11:11,140 --> 03:11:14,320
'There was nothing to be done,' he went on.

3863
03:11:14,320 --> 03:11:16,950
'An operation would have been useless.

3864
03:11:16,950 --> 03:11:18,160
I told her that.

3865
03:11:18,160 --> 03:11:23,021
In six months, she would have been dead.'

3866
03:11:23,021 --> 03:11:28,521
No one said a word and the doctor went on,
'Mrs de Winter looked a healthy woman.

3867
03:11:28,521 --> 03:11:30,681
She had very little pain at that time.

3868
03:11:30,681 --> 03:11:33,160
But the pain would have come.

3869
03:11:33,160 --> 03:11:36,001
The X-rays showed that she could never have
had a child.

3870
03:11:36,001 --> 03:11:38,710
But that was nothing to do with her illness.'

3871
03:11:38,710 --> 03:11:41,410
Everyone was standing up.

3872
03:11:41,410 --> 03:11:45,700
We shook hands with Dr Baker and he walked
with us to the front door.

3873
03:11:45,700 --> 03:11:47,750
'Shall I send you my report?'

3874
03:11:47,750 --> 03:11:49,450
Dr Baker asked.

3875
03:11:49,450 --> 03:11:52,320
'We may not need it,' said Colonel Julyan.

3876
03:11:52,320 --> 03:11:53,950
'We'll write to you if we do.

3877
03:11:53,950 --> 03:11:55,150
Thank you very much.'

3878
03:11:55,150 --> 03:12:00,280
'I am glad to have been of some use,' said
Dr Baker.

3879
03:12:00,280 --> 03:12:01,280
'Goodbye.'

3880
03:12:01,280 --> 03:12:11,750
And he shut the door.

3881
03:12:11,750 --> 03:12:17,410
CHAPTER TWENTY FOUR
The Return to Manderley

3882
03:12:17,410 --> 03:12:18,940
We went and stood by the car.

3883
03:12:18,940 --> 03:12:21,690
No one said anything for a few minutes.

3884
03:12:21,690 --> 03:12:24,140
Favell's face was grey.

3885
03:12:24,140 --> 03:12:25,710
His hand shook as he lit a cigarette.

3886
03:12:25,710 --> 03:12:29,780
'She kept it a secret from everyone, even
Danny.

3887
03:12:29,780 --> 03:12:33,301
It's been a dreadful shock to me,' Favell
said.

3888
03:12:33,301 --> 03:12:35,500
'You're all right, of course, Max.

3889
03:12:35,500 --> 03:12:37,510
You've been lucky, haven't you?

3890
03:12:37,510 --> 03:12:40,930
You and your young wife can go back to Manderley
now.

3891
03:12:40,930 --> 03:12:44,921
You think you've won, but don't be too sure,
I haven't finished with you yet.'

3892
03:12:44,921 --> 03:12:48,610
'Shall we get into the car and go?'

3893
03:12:48,610 --> 03:12:50,660
Colonel Julyan asked Maxim.

3894
03:12:50,660 --> 03:12:53,530
Favell smiled unpleasantly.

3895
03:12:53,530 --> 03:12:56,120
As we drove away, he was still standing there,
watching us.

3896
03:12:56,120 --> 03:13:01,301
'Favell can't do anything,' Colonel Julyan
told us.

3897
03:13:01,301 --> 03:13:04,450
'I'll soon deal with him if he comes near
Manderley again.

3898
03:13:04,450 --> 03:13:07,050
I don't think the papers will bother you any
more.

3899
03:13:07,050 --> 03:13:11,620
There may be some talk, but I'll make sure
that people hear about Dr Baker.'

3900
03:13:11,620 --> 03:13:14,521
'Thank you very much,' Maxim said.

3901
03:13:14,521 --> 03:13:19,160
'What a dreadful thing illness is,' Colonel
Julyan went on.

3902
03:13:19,160 --> 03:13:21,390
'I suppose she could not face the pain.

3903
03:13:21,390 --> 03:13:24,500
She was such a lovely young woman, too.'

3904
03:13:24,500 --> 03:13:27,850
Neither of us answered him.

3905
03:13:27,850 --> 03:13:32,811
Colonel Julyan's sister lived in London and
he asked Maxim to take him to her house.

3906
03:13:32,811 --> 03:13:37,790
'We must thank you for all your help,' Maxim
said as the magistrate got out of the car.

3907
03:13:37,790 --> 03:13:39,561
'I've been glad to help.

3908
03:13:39,561 --> 03:13:41,210
You must forget it all now.

3909
03:13:41,210 --> 03:13:44,150
Why don't you have a holiday, go abroad perhaps.

3910
03:13:44,150 --> 03:13:46,290
Goodbye, both of you.

3911
03:13:46,290 --> 03:13:48,980
It's been a long day.'

3912
03:13:48,980 --> 03:13:53,410
As Maxim started up the car, I leant back
in my seat and closed my eyes.

3913
03:13:53,410 --> 03:13:58,061
We drove on through the traffic and I felt
full of peace.

3914
03:13:58,061 --> 03:13:59,500
Nothing could hurt us any more.

3915
03:13:59,500 --> 03:14:04,010
We had dinner in a restaurant and Maxim phoned
Frank.

3916
03:14:04,010 --> 03:14:07,980
'Do you think Colonel Julyan knows the truth
about Rebecca's death?'

3917
03:14:07,980 --> 03:14:10,860
I asked Maxim as we were drinking our coffee.

3918
03:14:10,860 --> 03:14:13,771
'Of course he knows,' Maxim said.

3919
03:14:13,771 --> 03:14:16,601
'But he will never say anything.

3920
03:14:16,601 --> 03:14:19,431
I believe that Rebecca lied to me on purpose.

3921
03:14:19,431 --> 03:14:21,511
She wanted me to kill her.

3922
03:14:21,511 --> 03:14:23,301
That's why she laughed.

3923
03:14:23,301 --> 03:14:26,260
She was laughing when she died.'

3924
03:14:26,260 --> 03:14:27,340
I did not say anything.

3925
03:14:27,340 --> 03:14:29,120
It was all over.

3926
03:14:29,120 --> 03:14:33,500
There was no need for Maxim to look so white
and troubled.

3927
03:14:33,500 --> 03:14:38,540
'I'm not sure that Rebecca hasn't won, even
now,' Maxim went on.

3928
03:14:38,540 --> 03:14:41,420
'Frank told me something rather strange on
the phone.

3929
03:14:41,420 --> 03:14:43,910
Mrs Danvers has left Manderley.

3930
03:14:43,910 --> 03:14:47,381
There was a long-distance call for her at
six.

3931
03:14:47,381 --> 03:14:49,910
By a quarter to seven, she had gone.'

3932
03:14:49,910 --> 03:14:52,240
'Isn't that a good thing?'

3933
03:14:52,240 --> 03:14:53,240
I said.

3934
03:14:53,240 --> 03:14:55,290
'Favell phoned her, of course.

3935
03:14:55,290 --> 03:14:58,800
But they can't do anything to us.'

3936
03:14:58,800 --> 03:15:01,830
I was glad that Mrs Danvers had gone.

3937
03:15:01,830 --> 03:15:03,410
Manderley could be ours.

3938
03:15:03,410 --> 03:15:05,260
We would have people to stay.

3939
03:15:05,260 --> 03:15:08,590
And soon, very soon Maxim and I would have
children.

3940
03:15:08,590 --> 03:15:11,660
'Have you finished your coffee?'

3941
03:15:11,660 --> 03:15:12,660
Maxim said to me suddenly.

3942
03:15:12,660 --> 03:15:17,040
'I feel that we must get back to Manderley
as soon as possible.

3943
03:15:17,040 --> 03:15:19,410
Something's wrong, I know it is.'

3944
03:15:19,410 --> 03:15:22,211
'But you'll be so tired,' I said.

3945
03:15:22,211 --> 03:15:23,740
'No, I shall be all right.

3946
03:15:23,740 --> 03:15:26,900
We can be at Manderley by two o'clock.'

3947
03:15:26,900 --> 03:15:29,830
We went out to the car and Maxim covered me
with a rug.

3948
03:15:29,830 --> 03:15:34,000
It was dark now and I fell asleep almost at
once.

3949
03:15:34,000 --> 03:15:35,771
I started to dream.

3950
03:15:35,771 --> 03:15:42,710
I saw the staircase at Manderley and Mrs Danvers
standing there in her long, black dress.

3951
03:15:42,710 --> 03:15:47,591
Then, in my dream, I was alone in the woods
near Manderley.

3952
03:15:47,591 --> 03:15:51,351
I wanted to get to the Happy Valley, but I
could not find it.

3953
03:15:51,351 --> 03:15:54,130
The dark trees were all round me.

3954
03:15:54,130 --> 03:15:55,690
Then I was standing on the terrace.

3955
03:15:55,690 --> 03:15:58,230
Moonlight shone on the windows.

3956
03:15:58,230 --> 03:16:03,230
The gardens had gone and the dark woods came
up to the walls of the house.

3957
03:16:03,230 --> 03:16:05,950
I woke up suddenly.

3958
03:16:05,950 --> 03:16:08,760
'You've slept for two hours,' Maxim told me.

3959
03:16:08,760 --> 03:16:09,820
'It's quarter past two.

3960
03:16:09,820 --> 03:16:12,811
We shall be home by three.'

3961
03:16:12,811 --> 03:16:15,680
The early morning was very cold.

3962
03:16:15,680 --> 03:16:18,620
The sky was dark now and there were no stars.

3963
03:16:18,620 --> 03:16:21,521
'What time did you say it was?'

3964
03:16:21,521 --> 03:16:22,760
I said suddenly.

3965
03:16:22,760 --> 03:16:24,660
'It's twenty past two,' Maxim replied.

3966
03:16:24,660 --> 03:16:26,380
'That's strange,' I said.

3967
03:16:26,380 --> 03:16:31,990
'The dawn seems to be coming up over there,
behind those hills.

3968
03:16:31,990 --> 03:16:34,940
But it can't be, it's too early.'

3969
03:16:34,940 --> 03:16:39,410
'It's the wrong direction, too,' Maxim said
'you're looking west.'

3970
03:16:39,410 --> 03:16:42,471
I went on watching the sky.

3971
03:16:42,471 --> 03:16:44,021
It was still getting lighter.

3972
03:16:44,021 --> 03:16:48,261
A blood-red light was spreading across the
sky.

3973
03:16:48,261 --> 03:16:51,860
Maxim began to drive faster, much faster.

3974
03:16:51,860 --> 03:16:57,080
'That's not the dawn,' he said, 'that's Manderley.'

3975
03:16:57,080 --> 03:16:59,180
We reached the top of the hill.

3976
03:16:59,180 --> 03:17:02,850
The road to Manderley lay before us.

3977
03:17:02,850 --> 03:17:06,670
There was no moon and the sky above our heads
was black.

3978
03:17:06,670 --> 03:17:09,880
But the sky in front of us was full of dreadful
light.

3979
03:17:09,880 --> 03:17:14,780
And the light was red, red like blood.

3980
03:17:14,780 --> 03:17:18,070
The wind blew towards us from the sea.

3981
03:17:18,070 --> 03:17:26,610
The wind smelt of smoke and it was grey with
ashes.

3982
03:17:26,610 --> 03:17:34,229
They were the ashes of Manderley.
