00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:01,000
CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:02,960
Emil Goes to the City

3
00:00:06,559 --> 00:00:14,599
"Now, Emil," said his mother, "get ready. Your clothes are on your bed. Get dressed, and then we'll have our dinner."

4
00:00:15,819 --> 00:00:16,359
"Yes, Mother."

5
00:00:17,539 --> 00:00:34,659
"Wait a minute. Have I forgotten anything? Your other clothes are in your case. There's some food for your journey. These flowers are for your aunt. I'll give you the money for your grandmother after dinner. No, that's all, I think."

6
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:40,239
Emil left the room and Mrs Fisher turned to her neighbour, Mrs Martin.

7
00:00:41,759 --> 00:01:08,619
"My son's going to the city for two or three weeks. At first he didn't want to go. But what can he do here while his school's closed? My sister's asked us again and again to visit her. I can't go, because I have so much work. Emil's never travelled alone before, but he's old enough now. He'll be all right: his grandmother's going to meet him at the station."

8
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:12,779
"I think he'll enjoy the city," said Mrs Martin.

9
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:20,819
"All boys like it. There are so many things to see. I must go now, Mrs Fisher. Goodbye."

10
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,539
Emil came back into the room and sat down at the table.

11
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:30,139
His hair was tidy and he was wearing his best jacket.

12
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,400
While he ate, he watched his mother.

13
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:36,939
"I mustn't eat too much," he thought.

14
00:01:37,499 --> 00:01:40,179
"She won't like it when I'm going away for the first time."

15
00:01:41,619 --> 00:01:45,059
But his mother was thinking about other things.

16
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,119
"Don't forget to write to me when you arrive," she said.

17
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:50,680
"All right."

18
00:01:50,759 --> 00:02:02,678
"Give my love to your aunt and your grandmother and your cousin Polly. Look after yourself. And be good. I don't want anyone to say that you're not a polite boy."

19
00:02:03,718 --> 00:02:04,498
"I promise."

20
00:02:06,058 --> 00:02:08,658
After dinner Emil's mother went to the sitting-room.

21
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:12,198
There was a tin box on one of the shelves.

22
00:02:12,958 --> 00:02:15,698
She took out some money and came back to the table.

23
00:02:17,398 --> 00:02:19,558
"Here's seventy pounds," she said.

24
00:02:20,578 --> 00:02:51,599
"Five ten-pound notes and four five-pound notes. Give your grandmother sixty pounds. I couldn't send the money to her before. But I've worked hard and I've saved it for her. The other ten pounds is for you. Your return journey will cost about three pounds. Use the other seven pounds when you go out. I'll put the money in this little bag. Now don't lose it! Where will you put it?"

25
00:02:53,038 --> 00:02:58,198
Emil thought for a minute, then he put the bag into the pocket inside his jacket.

26
00:02:59,318 --> 00:03:01,118
"It'll be safe there," he said.

27
00:03:02,138 --> 00:03:03,658
His mother looked serious.

28
00:03:04,499 --> 00:03:07,698
"You mustn't tell anyone on the train about the money."

29
00:03:08,779 --> 00:03:10,718
"Of course not," said Emil.

30
00:03:12,298 --> 00:03:15,718
Some people think that seventy pounds is not a large amount of money.

31
00:03:16,678 --> 00:03:19,138
But it was a lot of money to Emil and his mother.

32
00:03:20,378 --> 00:03:24,238
Emil's father was dead, so his mother worked hard all day.

33
00:03:25,378 --> 00:03:29,938
She paid for their food and clothes, and for her son's books and his school.

34
00:03:30,998 --> 00:03:33,138
Emil realized that his mother worked hard.

35
00:03:33,858 --> 00:03:36,058
So he really tried to do well in class.

36
00:03:37,279 --> 00:03:41,319
She was always pleased when he got a good report from his teacher at the end of the year.

37
00:03:42,578 --> 00:03:44,599
"Let's go now," said Mrs Fisher.

38
00:03:45,018 --> 00:03:49,218
"You mustn't miss the train. If the bus comes along, we'll take it."

39
00:03:51,078 --> 00:03:54,758
The country bus was very old and slow.

40
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:57,358
Emil and his friends wanted modern buses in Newton.

41
00:03:58,178 --> 00:04:00,857
But other people in the town liked their old bus.

42
00:04:01,817 --> 00:04:03,197
They liked the driver, too.

43
00:04:03,997 --> 00:04:05,857
He always stopped at your house for you.

44
00:04:06,757 --> 00:04:08,878
You called out, and the driver stopped.

45
00:04:09,857 --> 00:04:11,417
But it was often quicker to walk.

46
00:04:13,218 --> 00:04:15,817
The bus came and Emil and his mother got on.

47
00:04:17,218 --> 00:04:19,917
They got off at the square in front of the station.

48
00:04:21,037 --> 00:04:25,977
Then they heard a deep voice behind them: "Where are you going?"

49
00:04:27,197 --> 00:04:28,937
It was Newton's chief of police.

50
00:04:30,237 --> 00:04:35,258
Emil's mother said: "My son's going to visit his grandmother for two or three weeks."

51
00:04:36,457 --> 00:04:37,457
Emil felt silly.

52
00:04:38,157 --> 00:04:39,477
He was remembering something.

53
00:04:40,837 --> 00:04:45,817
In the centre of the station square there was a statue of a very famous judge.

54
00:04:46,738 --> 00:04:53,237
One day, after school, Emil and his friends climbed up and put an old cap on the statue's head.

55
00:04:54,218 --> 00:04:56,937
Then Emil began to paint its nose red.

56
00:04:57,977 --> 00:05:00,457
Suddenly, the chief of police walked into the square.

57
00:05:01,617 --> 00:05:06,677
"Oh no, he saw me," thought Emil, as he and his friends ran away.

58
00:05:08,077 --> 00:05:17,817
Now, a week later, Emil waited for the policeman to say: "Emil Fisher, come with me. You are going to prison."

59
00:05:19,257 --> 00:05:23,637
But the policeman didn't say anything as Emil carried his case into the station.

60
00:05:24,738 --> 00:05:27,657
Perhaps he was waiting until Emil came back from the city.

61
00:05:30,617 --> 00:05:30,617
***

62
00:05:30,738 --> 00:05:32,878
Mrs Fisher bought a ticket for Emil.

63
00:05:33,757 --> 00:05:35,918
They only had to wait a few minutes for the train.

64
00:05:37,238 --> 00:05:47,037
"Don't leave anything on the train. And don't sit on the flowers. Someone will lift your case up for you. Don't forget to say "please"."

65
00:05:48,477 --> 00:05:51,057
"I can lift the case up," said Emil.

66
00:05:51,637 --> 00:05:53,937
"I'm not a baby."

67
00:05:54,017 --> 00:05:58,277
"All right." His mother was looking serious again.

68
00:05:58,337 --> 00:06:01,496
"You must get out at the right station in the city," she said.

69
00:06:02,037 --> 00:06:09,416
"It's the East Station, not the West Station. Your grandmother will be by the ticket office."

70
00:06:10,576 --> 00:06:11,516
"I'll find her, Mother."

71
00:06:12,857 --> 00:06:18,376
"Don't throw paper on the floor of the carriage when you eat your food. And don't lose the money."

72
00:06:19,936 --> 00:06:22,557
Emil opened his jacket and felt in his pocket.

73
00:06:23,637 --> 00:06:25,016
"Don't worry," he said.

74
00:06:25,336 --> 00:06:26,076
"It's safe."

75
00:06:27,456 --> 00:06:29,036
The train came into the station.

76
00:06:30,016 --> 00:06:33,477
Emil kissed his mother and climbed into a carriage with his case.

77
00:06:34,536 --> 00:06:36,616
His mother gave him the flowers and food.

78
00:06:37,896 --> 00:06:40,137
"Is there a seat for you?" she asked.

79
00:06:41,096 --> 00:06:42,616
"Yes," said Emil.

80
00:06:43,696 --> 00:06:45,497
"Be good. And write to me."

81
00:06:46,556 --> 00:06:47,936
"You must write to me, too."

82
00:06:48,997 --> 00:06:52,356
"Of course. Now, be nice to your cousin, Polly."

83
00:06:53,776 --> 00:06:58,137
The carriage doors were shut and the train moved slowly out of the station.

84
00:06:59,356 --> 00:07:01,976
Mrs Fisher waved her hand for a long time.

85
00:07:02,996 --> 00:07:05,216
Then she turned round and went home.

86
00:07:06,436 --> 00:07:10,256
She felt sad, but she only cried for a short time.

87
00:07:10,316 --> 00:07:11,496
She had to do her work.

88
00:07:15,676 --> 00:07:16,396
CHAPTER TWO

89
00:07:17,096 --> 00:07:17,756
The Thief

90
00:07:19,996 --> 00:07:25,336
Emil took off his school cap and said "good afternoon" to the other people in the carriage.

91
00:07:26,697 --> 00:07:28,856
He sat opposite a fat lady.

92
00:07:29,556 --> 00:07:33,556
She was only wearing one shoe, because her left shoe hurt her foot.

93
00:07:35,157 --> 00:07:38,116
She was sitting beside a man with a big nose.

94
00:07:40,036 --> 00:07:43,636
"Boys are not usually so polite," she said to the man.

95
00:07:44,936 --> 00:07:48,096
As she talked, she moved her painful foot up and down.

96
00:07:49,736 --> 00:07:51,416
Emil put his hand in his pocket.

97
00:07:52,256 --> 00:07:54,656
He wasn't happy until he felt the little bag.

98
00:07:55,676 --> 00:07:58,376
He looked at the other people in the carriage.

99
00:07:58,436 --> 00:07:59,935
They didn't look like thieves.

100
00:08:00,856 --> 00:08:04,275
There was another woman sitting to the right of the man with the big nose.

101
00:08:05,216 --> 00:08:08,235
She was sewing, making a cap for a baby.

102
00:08:09,435 --> 00:08:14,495
At the window, next to Emil, a man with a black hat was reading a newspaper.

103
00:08:16,135 --> 00:08:20,775
Suddenly the man put down his paper and took some sweets from his pocket.

104
00:08:22,315 --> 00:08:24,596
"Would you like one?" he asked Emil.

105
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:29,516
"Thank you very much," said Emil, taking one of the sweets.

106
00:08:30,395 --> 00:08:32,735
"My name's Emil Fisher," he said.

107
00:08:34,235 --> 00:08:37,015
The other people in the carriage smiled in a friendly way.

108
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:41,955
The man lifted his hat and said: "My name's Green."

109
00:08:43,675 --> 00:08:49,616
Then the fat lady asked Emil: "Does Mr Smith still own the cloth shop in Newton?"

110
00:08:50,995 --> 00:08:52,616
"Oh yes," said Emil.

111
00:08:53,075 --> 00:08:53,775
"Do you know him?"

112
00:08:55,116 --> 00:09:01,735
"Yes. I'm Mrs James from Greenfield. I hope he's well. Can you tell him that?"

113
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,895
"Yes, of course," replied Emil.

114
00:09:06,355 --> 00:09:09,435
"Are you going to the city?" Mr Green asked Emil.

115
00:09:10,516 --> 00:09:17,695
"Yes. My grandmother's meeting me at the East Station ticket office." He felt in his pocket.

116
00:09:18,275 --> 00:09:20,995
The paper money in the bag made a little noise.

117
00:09:21,595 --> 00:09:22,436
It was still there.

118
00:09:23,656 --> 00:09:24,675
"Do you know the city?"

119
00:09:25,756 --> 00:09:26,035
"No."

120
00:09:27,156 --> 00:09:45,855
"Well, it will surprise you. Some of the houses there are 600 metres high. They tie the roofs to the sky. Then the houses don't move in the wind. And what do you do if you want to get to another part of the city quickly? Do you know?"

121
00:09:47,455 --> 00:09:51,555
"No," Emil answered, thinking, "This is a strange man!"

122
00:09:52,875 --> 00:10:05,234
"You're put in a box at the post office, and then you travel by post. And if you have no money, you can get fifty pounds from a bank. But you have to leave your head there..."

123
00:10:06,654 --> 00:10:09,894
"Is your head at the bank?" the man with the big nose said.

124
00:10:10,514 --> 00:10:12,894
"Stop telling the boy stupid stories."

125
00:10:14,394 --> 00:10:15,914
The two men began to shout.

126
00:10:16,734 --> 00:10:21,114
Fat Mrs James stopped moving her foot, and the other woman stopped sewing.

127
00:10:22,654 --> 00:10:26,414
Emil was happy, because the strange man couldn't talk to him now.

128
00:10:27,574 --> 00:10:31,014
He took out his food and began to eat his bread and butter.

129
00:10:32,114 --> 00:10:35,034
Then the train stopped at a big station.

130
00:10:36,355 --> 00:10:39,094
The two ladies and the man with the big nose got out.

131
00:10:40,134 --> 00:10:44,094
Mrs James was almost too late because she couldn't get her shoe on.

132
00:10:45,574 --> 00:10:50,114
"Tell Mr Smith what I said," she called to Emil as she left the train.

133
00:10:51,974 --> 00:10:55,194
Now Emil and the man with the black hat were alone.

134
00:10:56,394 --> 00:10:58,194
Emil wasn't very pleased about this.

135
00:10:58,994 --> 00:11:02,634
He didn't want to be with a strange man who gave away sweets.

136
00:11:03,214 --> 00:11:05,554
A man who told silly stories.

137
00:11:07,294 --> 00:11:11,434
Emil wanted to feel the money again, but not in front of the other man.

138
00:11:12,994 --> 00:11:14,974
Then the train started again.

139
00:11:16,274 --> 00:11:18,694
Emil went to the washroom at the end of the carriage.

140
00:11:19,895 --> 00:11:23,614
He took the little bag out of his pocket and counted the money.

141
00:11:24,674 --> 00:11:29,715
It was still there, but how could he make it safer?

142
00:11:29,774 --> 00:11:34,134
Then he remembered: there was a pin in his jacket.

143
00:11:35,334 --> 00:11:42,355
He took out the pin and pushed it through the bag, the paper money and the cloth of his inside pocket.

144
00:11:43,535 --> 00:11:44,714
The money was safe now.

145
00:11:46,514 --> 00:11:47,934
Emil went back to the carriage.

146
00:11:48,834 --> 00:11:49,974
Mr Green was asleep.

147
00:11:51,035 --> 00:11:54,014
Emil was glad - now he didn't have to talk to him.

148
00:11:55,355 --> 00:11:56,434
He looked out of the window.

149
00:11:57,174 --> 00:12:00,633
He enjoyed watching the trees, the fields and the houses.

150
00:12:01,953 --> 00:12:03,813
Mr Green continued sleeping.

151
00:12:04,913 --> 00:12:06,773
Sometimes he made little noises.

152
00:12:07,733 --> 00:12:08,573
Emil watched him.

153
00:12:09,754 --> 00:12:11,493
Why did he always keep his hat on?

154
00:12:12,873 --> 00:12:15,814
Emil noticed his long face and thin ears.

155
00:12:17,593 --> 00:12:19,913
Suddenly Emil jumped with surprise.

156
00:12:21,714 --> 00:12:26,513
"I nearly went to sleep. I mustn't do that," he told himself.

157
00:12:27,873 --> 00:12:29,973
He didn't like being alone with Mr Green.

158
00:12:31,033 --> 00:12:34,513
Emil wanted more people in the carriage, but nobody came.

159
00:12:35,453 --> 00:12:37,353
He kicked his foot to stay awake.

160
00:12:38,233 --> 00:12:40,834
He sometimes did this at school in history lessons.

161
00:12:42,273 --> 00:12:44,154
For a short time, this helped him.

162
00:12:45,273 --> 00:12:46,953
He thought about his cousin, Polly.

163
00:12:47,853 --> 00:12:48,974
What did she look like now?

164
00:12:50,193 --> 00:12:52,253
It was two years since he last saw her.

165
00:12:53,113 --> 00:12:55,053
He couldn't remember her face very well.

166
00:12:56,833 --> 00:13:00,093
Some minutes later, he nearly fell off his seat.

167
00:13:01,314 --> 00:13:03,833
"Have I been asleep?" he thought.

168
00:13:04,773 --> 00:13:05,853
He kicked his foot again.

169
00:13:06,713 --> 00:13:09,313
Then he counted the flies on the window.

170
00:13:10,273 --> 00:13:18,233
He counted them from the bottom to the top, he counted them from the top to the bottom, and then he counted them again.

171
00:13:19,533 --> 00:13:24,194
First there were twenty-four, then there were twenty-three.

172
00:13:25,713 --> 00:13:28,813
"Why does the number change?" Emil asked himself.

173
00:13:30,213 --> 00:13:31,373
Then he fell asleep.

174
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:33,833
***

175
00:13:33,893 --> 00:13:37,413
When Emil woke up, he was lying on the floor of the carriage.

176
00:13:38,353 --> 00:13:39,413
The train was moving.

177
00:13:40,514 --> 00:13:41,693
He remembered his dream.

178
00:13:42,413 --> 00:13:43,773
It was a bad dream.

179
00:13:44,654 --> 00:13:47,233
The policeman from Newton was running after him.

180
00:13:48,053 --> 00:13:50,833
He caught him and took him to the stone judge.

181
00:13:51,893 --> 00:13:59,992
The judge was alive and said: "Emil Fisher, you painted my nose, so you must go to prison."

182
00:14:02,072 --> 00:14:03,892
Slowly Emil began to remember.

183
00:14:05,233 --> 00:14:07,912
Of course, he was going to the city.

184
00:14:09,113 --> 00:14:12,653
Did he fall asleep, like the man in the black hat...?

185
00:14:14,592 --> 00:14:16,292
But the man wasn't there.

186
00:14:17,392 --> 00:14:19,192
Emil was alone in the carriage.

187
00:14:20,253 --> 00:14:20,872
He sat up.

188
00:14:21,672 --> 00:14:22,753
His knees were shaking.

189
00:14:23,692 --> 00:14:24,913
He got up from the floor.

190
00:14:25,892 --> 00:14:29,913
His clothes were dirty, so he cleaned them quickly with his hands.

191
00:14:30,912 --> 00:14:33,012
Then he felt in his inside pocket.

192
00:14:34,292 --> 00:14:35,832
The money wasn't there!

193
00:14:37,712 --> 00:14:41,152
Emil felt a sharp pain and pulled his hand from his pocket.

194
00:14:42,352 --> 00:14:47,432
There was blood on his finger from the pin, but there was no little bag there.

195
00:14:48,832 --> 00:14:50,192
Emil began to cry.

196
00:14:51,652 --> 00:14:54,032
Of course, he was not crying about the blood.

197
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:56,632
He was crying about the money.

198
00:14:57,892 --> 00:15:05,432
His mother worked so hard, and now there was no money for his grandmother or for his visit to the city.

199
00:15:07,392 --> 00:15:15,052
"I've been careless, and a thief has stolen my money. Now what can I do?" he thought.

200
00:15:16,272 --> 00:15:22,772
"How can I get off the train and say to my grandmother: "Here I am, but I have no money for you.

201
00:15:23,492 --> 00:15:26,413
And you must give me the money for my ticket back to Newton."

202
00:15:27,712 --> 00:15:29,212
I can't stay in the city.

203
00:15:29,992 --> 00:15:31,252
I can't go home again."

204
00:15:32,892 --> 00:15:35,892
There was an alarm above the window at one end of the carriage.

205
00:15:37,072 --> 00:15:47,752
Emil thought, "If I ring the alarm, the train will stop. A railway guard will come to the carriage. He'll ask: "What's happened?

206
00:15:48,372 --> 00:15:49,092
What's the matter?""

207
00:15:50,352 --> 00:15:53,372
And I'll say: "Someone's stolen my money."

208
00:15:54,792 --> 00:15:57,252
"Why didn't you look after it?" he'll answer.

209
00:15:57,832 --> 00:16:06,371
"What's your name? Where do you live? You stopped the train. Now your family will have to pay twenty-five pounds.""

210
00:16:08,731 --> 00:16:26,072
In fast trains there is a corridor that you can walk along. It takes you to the place where the guard sits. Then you can report a crime. But Emil was in a slow train. There is no corridor on slow trains. You must wait until the train stops at the next station.

211
00:16:27,831 --> 00:16:28,572
"What's the time?"

212
00:16:29,091 --> 00:16:29,711
Emil thought.

213
00:16:30,832 --> 00:16:36,692
The train began to pass large houses with bright gardens, and tall buildings with dirty windows.

214
00:16:37,711 --> 00:16:39,891
The train was moving more slowly now.

215
00:16:41,391 --> 00:16:42,551
Emil knew what to do.

216
00:16:44,012 --> 00:16:58,731
"At the next station I must call the railway guard and tell him everything. The railway company will tell the police. But then I'll have problems with the police," he thought, remembering his dream.

217
00:16:59,911 --> 00:17:07,251
"They'll ask the Newton police about me." He imagined the Newton police chief's report:

218
00:17:07,311 --> 00:17:10,491
Emil Fisher of Newton is not a good boy.

219
00:17:11,391 --> 00:17:13,391
He paints the noses of statues.

220
00:17:14,391 --> 00:17:17,111
I do not believe that his money was stolen.

221
00:17:17,991 --> 00:17:20,531
Perhaps he was careless and lost it.

222
00:17:21,192 --> 00:17:25,351
But he probably hid it because he wanted to use it for himself.

223
00:17:26,531 --> 00:17:27,971
Emil Fisher is the thief.

224
00:17:28,652 --> 00:17:30,371
We must put him in prison.

225
00:17:32,411 --> 00:17:34,511
Emil thought about the report and was afraid.

226
00:17:35,711 --> 00:17:38,091
No, he couldn't tell the police.

227
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:42,151
He took his case down and put on his cap.

228
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:46,711
Then he put the pin back in his jacket and got ready.

229
00:17:47,851 --> 00:17:48,872
The train stopped.

230
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:53,691
Emil looked out of the window and saw a sign on a wall.

231
00:17:54,512 --> 00:17:58,131
It said: WEST STATION.

232
00:17:58,192 --> 00:18:01,190
The doors were opened and people got out of the carriages.

233
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:03,310
Friends were waiting to meet them.

234
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,951
Suddenly he saw a black hat in the crowd.

235
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:09,930
It was some metres away.

236
00:18:10,991 --> 00:18:11,930
Was it the thief?

237
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:16,871
Perhaps he stole Emil's money but didn't leave the train.

238
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:21,410
Perhaps he just moved to another carriage while the train was at one of the stations.

239
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:23,970
Emil got out quickly.

240
00:18:24,951 --> 00:18:26,451
Then he remembered the flowers.

241
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:30,890
He put down his case and jumped back into the carriage.

242
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:35,050
He got out again with the flowers and picked up his case.

243
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:39,890
Then he ran as fast as he could towards the gate.

244
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:48,930
"Where was the black hat? There it was. Or was it a different hat?" Emil's case was heavy.

245
00:18:49,451 --> 00:18:51,230
He wanted to put it down and leave it.

246
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:54,270
"But someone will steal it," he thought.

247
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:57,951
At last he got through the crowd.

248
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:00,670
He was now closer to the black hat.

249
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:02,470
Was it the thief?

250
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:03,971
No.

251
00:19:05,151 --> 00:19:06,050
There was another one.

252
00:19:07,151 --> 00:19:09,550
No, that man was too short.

253
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:13,511
Emil ran in and out of the crowd.

254
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:15,090
There!

255
00:19:15,331 --> 00:19:17,150
There was Mr Green, the thief.

256
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:21,670
He was passing through the gate and he seemed to be in a great hurry.

257
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:25,810
"I'll get you!" thought Emil angrily.

258
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:35,330
He gave his ticket to the railway man, put his case in his other hand and, with the flowers under his right arm, ran after the black hat.

259
00:19:37,111 --> 00:19:39,430
"It's now or never!" he thought.

260
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:44,450
CHAPTER THREE

261
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:47,270
Emil Goes after the Thief

262
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:53,710
Emil wanted to run after the man and shout: "Give me my money!"

263
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:59,449
"But," he thought," the man won't say: "Of course, dear boy.

264
00:19:59,829 --> 00:20:00,589
Here it is.

265
00:20:01,149 --> 00:20:03,070
I promise that I'll never steal again.""

266
00:20:04,329 --> 00:20:07,649
No, now he could only watch the man.

267
00:20:09,229 --> 00:20:11,909
A very fat lady was walking in front of Emil.

268
00:20:12,609 --> 00:20:15,809
He hid behind her and followed the thief out of the station.

269
00:20:17,369 --> 00:20:22,369
"If I ask that lady for help," Emil thought, "she probably won't believe me."

270
00:20:24,049 --> 00:20:26,469
The man walked into the station square.

271
00:20:27,229 --> 00:20:28,249
He crossed the road.

272
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:33,529
An electric tram with two carriages turned into the road from the right.

273
00:20:34,489 --> 00:20:39,349
The man got into the first carriage and sat down next to a window.

274
00:20:40,789 --> 00:20:42,529
Emil ran after the tram.

275
00:20:43,669 --> 00:20:46,590
The tram started moving as he reached the second carriage.

276
00:20:47,369 --> 00:20:52,250
He jumped on the tram, put his case in a corner and stood in front of it.

277
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:55,829
Cars hurried past the tram.

278
00:20:56,709 --> 00:20:59,569
There was a lot of noise, and there were a lot of people.

279
00:21:00,469 --> 00:21:08,949
There were newspaper boys at every corner, and wonderful windows filled with books, gold watches, shoes and food.

280
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:12,549
And the buildings were very, very high.

281
00:21:14,229 --> 00:21:17,869
"So this is the city!" Emil thought.

282
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:22,129
He wanted to look at everything, but there was no time.

283
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:31,549
"The man with my money will get off the tram and escape into the crowd. Then everything will be hopeless," he thought.

284
00:21:33,089 --> 00:21:34,789
Emil thought about his grandmother.

285
00:21:35,649 --> 00:21:38,549
She was waiting for him at the ticket office in East Station.

286
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:40,669
The tram stopped.

287
00:21:41,729 --> 00:21:43,449
Emil watched the carriage in front.

288
00:21:44,489 --> 00:21:48,089
A crowd of new passengers got on, but nobody got off.

289
00:21:49,169 --> 00:21:52,309
One man was angry because he fell over Emil's case.

290
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:56,250
A man inside the tram was selling tickets.

291
00:21:56,969 --> 00:21:59,308
He rang the bell and the tram moved again.

292
00:22:00,589 --> 00:22:09,189
Suddenly Emil thought: "Oh, no. I haven't got any money. If I can't pay for the ticket, I'll have to get off."

293
00:22:10,689 --> 00:22:12,028
He looked at the other passengers.

294
00:22:13,309 --> 00:22:18,069
"Can I say to one of them: "Please give me some money for my ticket"?" he thought.

295
00:22:19,328 --> 00:22:20,989
One man was reading a newspaper.

296
00:22:21,748 --> 00:22:23,928
Two others were talking about a bank robbery.

297
00:22:25,309 --> 00:22:34,508
"The thieves made a hole underground," one of them was saying, "and they went through the hole into the bank. They stole thousands of pounds."

298
00:22:35,668 --> 00:22:36,728
The other man laughed.

299
00:22:38,048 --> 00:22:40,708
"Who can believe what people say?" he asked.

300
00:22:41,368 --> 00:22:43,328
"Perhaps only a little money was taken."

301
00:22:45,069 --> 00:22:46,448
"No," thought Emil.

302
00:22:47,229 --> 00:22:48,248
"They won't believe me!"

303
00:22:49,828 --> 00:22:52,428
The ticket man came nearer and nearer to Emil.

304
00:22:53,708 --> 00:22:56,968
"Tickets! Tickets, please!" he called out.

305
00:22:57,988 --> 00:23:00,708
People gave him their money and received their tickets.

306
00:23:01,628 --> 00:23:03,168
He reached Emil.

307
00:23:03,228 --> 00:23:04,988
"And you?" he asked.

308
00:23:06,168 --> 00:23:10,448
"I've lost my money, sir," Emil said.

309
00:23:10,508 --> 00:23:15,288
"Lost your money? I've heard that story before. And where do you want to go?"

310
00:23:17,028 --> 00:23:22,528
"I... I... don't know yet," said Emil.

311
00:23:23,469 --> 00:23:26,048
"Well, then, get off at the next stop!"

312
00:23:27,148 --> 00:23:31,668
"No, I can't do that. I must stay here. Please, sir."

313
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:36,628
"If I tell you to get off, you get off. Do you understand?"

314
00:23:38,008 --> 00:23:43,508
"Oh, give the boy a ticket!" said the man who was reading a newspaper.

315
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:47,328
He gave the ticket man some money, and Emil received his ticket.

316
00:23:48,448 --> 00:23:52,228
"A lot of boys tell me they've lost their money," said the ticket man.

317
00:23:52,648 --> 00:23:54,988
"Then they laugh at me behind my back."

318
00:23:56,168 --> 00:23:59,368
"This one won't laugh at you," said the man with the newspaper.

319
00:24:00,867 --> 00:24:03,107
"Thank you very much, sir," Emil said.

320
00:24:03,947 --> 00:24:06,788
"Oh, that's all right," the man with the newspaper said.

321
00:24:07,847 --> 00:24:10,307
"Excuse me, sir. Where do you live?"

322
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:12,407
"Why do you want to know?"

323
00:24:13,688 --> 00:24:23,147
"I want to give you back your money. I'm staying here for a few weeks, so I can bring it to you. My name's Emil Fisher, from Newton."

324
00:24:24,247 --> 00:24:26,827
"Oh, forget about it," said the man.

325
00:24:28,287 --> 00:24:29,447
The tram stopped again.

326
00:24:30,448 --> 00:24:31,148
Emil watched.

327
00:24:31,968 --> 00:24:33,648
Did the man in the black hat get off?

328
00:24:34,507 --> 00:24:35,307
He saw nothing.

329
00:24:36,347 --> 00:24:38,087
The tram continued its journey.

330
00:24:38,968 --> 00:24:41,447
Emil looked at the beautiful wide roads.

331
00:24:42,108 --> 00:24:44,047
He had no idea where he was going.

332
00:24:45,268 --> 00:24:47,587
The thief was still sitting in the other carriage.

333
00:24:48,268 --> 00:24:49,967
Nobody seemed interested in Emil.

334
00:24:50,628 --> 00:24:53,367
Even the kind man was reading his newspaper again.

335
00:24:54,827 --> 00:24:58,567
The city was so large and Emil felt so small.

336
00:24:59,567 --> 00:25:01,787
It didn't matter to anyone that he had no money.

337
00:25:02,787 --> 00:25:07,867
Two million people lived in the city, and nobody was interested in his problems.

338
00:25:09,407 --> 00:25:11,847
"What's going to happen?" Emil thought.

339
00:25:12,927 --> 00:25:14,427
He felt very unhappy.

340
00:25:17,107 --> 00:25:17,107
***

341
00:25:17,207 --> 00:25:22,827
Emil's grandmother and his cousin Polly were waiting for him at East Station.

342
00:25:22,887 --> 00:25:26,747
They were standing near the ticket office, looking at the time every minute.

343
00:25:27,988 --> 00:25:32,327
A lot of people passed them, carrying boxes, cases and flowers.

344
00:25:33,128 --> 00:25:34,507
But not one of them was Emil.

345
00:25:36,227 --> 00:25:39,847
"Perhaps he passed us and we didn't see him," said Polly.

346
00:25:40,927 --> 00:25:43,667
She stood on the platform with her shining new bicycle.

347
00:25:44,488 --> 00:25:47,027
She wanted to show it to Emil.

348
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:49,667
"He'll want one too, when he sees it," she thought.

349
00:25:50,967 --> 00:25:52,447
Polly's grandmother was worried.

350
00:25:53,827 --> 00:25:59,866
"What is the matter? What is the matter? I think the train arrived a long time ago."

351
00:26:01,486 --> 00:26:05,206
They waited a few more minutes, then Polly went to ask about the train.

352
00:26:06,407 --> 00:26:09,567
A man was standing at the gate, looking at people's tickets.

353
00:26:10,946 --> 00:26:13,987
"Has the train from Newton arrived yet?" Polly asked him.

354
00:26:14,866 --> 00:26:17,586
"Newton? Oh, yes," said the man.

355
00:26:18,126 --> 00:26:20,266
"That train arrived a long time ago."

356
00:26:22,026 --> 00:26:24,666
Polly went back to her grandmother and gave her the news.

357
00:26:25,567 --> 00:26:31,426
"Oh dear. What's happened? What's happened?" the old lady said.

358
00:26:32,586 --> 00:26:35,746
"I think he got out at the wrong station," said Polly.

359
00:26:36,187 --> 00:26:38,206
"Boys are so stupid."

360
00:26:39,586 --> 00:26:41,187
They waited for another five minutes.

361
00:26:42,086 --> 00:26:44,546
"We can't stay here," said Polly.

362
00:26:45,066 --> 00:26:52,106
"The next train from Newton is in two hours. Let's go home now. I'll come back here on my bicycle and meet him."

363
00:26:53,626 --> 00:26:58,806
"I don't like it. I don't like it," said the old lady.

364
00:26:59,827 --> 00:27:03,186
When she was worried about something, she always said things twice.

365
00:27:04,727 --> 00:27:08,507
At home, Polly's father and mother didn't know what to do.

366
00:27:09,606 --> 00:27:11,806
Polly's father wanted to write to Emil's mother.

367
00:27:12,867 --> 00:27:14,986
"No, don't do that," said his wife.

368
00:27:15,526 --> 00:27:17,046
"Perhaps he'll be on the next train."

369
00:27:18,687 --> 00:27:21,406
"I hope he will," said Polly's grandmother.

370
00:27:21,886 --> 00:27:25,466
"But I don't like it. I don't like it."

371
00:27:26,846 --> 00:27:30,666
"I don't like it either," said Polly, shaking her head wisely.

372
00:27:34,666 --> 00:27:35,426
CHAPTER FOUR

373
00:27:36,187 --> 00:27:37,966
Emil's Friends Make a Plan

374
00:27:39,966 --> 00:27:43,186
At last the man in the black hat got off the tram.

375
00:27:44,106 --> 00:27:49,926
Emil picked up his case and the flowers, thanked the man with the newspaper, and followed the thief.

376
00:27:51,226 --> 00:27:56,666
The thief walked in front of the tram, crossed the road and continued on the other side.

377
00:27:57,606 --> 00:28:01,526
The tram moved away, and Emil saw the man go into a cafe.

378
00:28:02,925 --> 00:28:06,825
"Now," thought Emil, "I must be very careful."

379
00:28:08,605 --> 00:28:10,465
There was a house at the corner of the road.

380
00:28:11,245 --> 00:28:12,605
He ran into the doorway.

381
00:28:13,285 --> 00:28:14,845
It was a good place to hide.

382
00:28:15,566 --> 00:28:18,045
From there, he could see the thief easily.

383
00:28:19,785 --> 00:28:22,685
Mr Green was sitting close to the cafe window.

384
00:28:23,505 --> 00:28:25,766
He was looking very pleased with himself.

385
00:28:26,625 --> 00:28:27,765
He ordered some coffee.

386
00:28:29,085 --> 00:28:30,586
Emil didn't know what to do.

387
00:28:31,545 --> 00:28:37,746
"I can't stay here and watch the man. A policeman will come along and tell me to move," he thought.

388
00:28:38,766 --> 00:28:41,845
Suddenly a horn sounded just behind Emil.

389
00:28:42,426 --> 00:28:44,785
He jumped and turned round quickly.

390
00:28:45,885 --> 00:28:48,145
A boy stood there, laughing at him.

391
00:28:49,205 --> 00:28:51,426
"Don't be afraid," said the boy.

392
00:28:52,746 --> 00:28:55,385
"Did you make that loud noise?" asked Emil.

393
00:28:56,105 --> 00:28:57,965
"Of course," said the boy.

394
00:28:58,805 --> 00:29:05,165
"You're not from here, are you? Everyone here knows me and my horn. I always carry it with me."

395
00:29:06,625 --> 00:29:09,005
"No, I'm not from here," said Emil.

396
00:29:09,445 --> 00:29:12,505
"I'm from Newton. I've just come from the station."

397
00:29:13,845 --> 00:29:18,865
"Newton? From the country? Is that why you're wearing those silly clothes?"

398
00:29:20,385 --> 00:29:24,425
"Don't talk like that, or I'll hit you," said Emil angrily.

399
00:29:25,625 --> 00:29:28,185
The other boy looked surprised.

400
00:29:28,246 --> 00:29:30,125
"I don't want to fight," he said.

401
00:29:30,505 --> 00:29:33,045
"It's too hot. But I will if you want to."

402
00:29:34,725 --> 00:29:37,665
"I haven't got time to fight now," said Emil.

403
00:29:38,066 --> 00:29:40,025
"I'm busy."

404
00:29:40,106 --> 00:29:44,025
"Busy? You aren't doing anything, just standing in this doorway."

405
00:29:45,125 --> 00:29:47,445
"Yes, I am," Emil answered.

406
00:29:47,985 --> 00:29:49,485
"I'm watching a thief."

407
00:29:50,625 --> 00:29:52,945
"What! Did you say "thief"?"

408
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:55,925
"That's right," said Emil.

409
00:29:56,645 --> 00:29:58,864
He told the boy about losing all his money.

410
00:29:59,984 --> 00:30:04,804
"Well, this is wonderful," said the boy as Emil finished the story.

411
00:30:05,564 --> 00:30:10,264
"It's like a detective film at the cinema. What are you going to do next?"

412
00:30:11,464 --> 00:30:12,204
"I don't know."

413
00:30:13,165 --> 00:30:17,924
"Look. There's a policeman over there. Let's tell him. He'll help you."

414
00:30:19,244 --> 00:30:21,184
"I don't think so," said Emil.

415
00:30:21,865 --> 00:30:25,804
"I did something wrong in Newton. I think the police want to catch me."

416
00:30:26,965 --> 00:30:30,604
"Oh, I see," said the boy.

417
00:30:31,484 --> 00:30:36,264
He thought for a minute, then said: "I'll help you, if you want me to."

418
00:30:37,504 --> 00:30:38,944
"I'd like that," said Emil.

419
00:30:39,804 --> 00:30:42,104
"My name's Paul," said the boy.

420
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:44,144
"And mine's Emil."

421
00:30:45,405 --> 00:30:46,984
"Well, Emil," said Paul.

422
00:30:47,584 --> 00:30:51,284
"We must do something. Have you got any money now?"

423
00:30:52,404 --> 00:30:53,205
"Not a penny."

424
00:30:54,484 --> 00:30:56,284
Paul sounded his horn softly.

425
00:30:56,904 --> 00:30:58,424
It usually helped him think.

426
00:30:59,124 --> 00:31:00,365
But it didn't help this time.

427
00:31:01,824 --> 00:31:04,824
"Can you bring some of your friends here?" asked Emil.

428
00:31:05,785 --> 00:31:07,724
"Good idea," said Paul.

429
00:31:08,444 --> 00:31:14,144
"I'll run round to their houses and sound my horn. Then they'll come out and help us."

430
00:31:15,484 --> 00:31:18,604
"OK, but come back soon," said Emil.

431
00:31:19,084 --> 00:31:23,224
"If the thief leaves, I'll have to follow him. Then you won't know where I am."

432
00:31:24,124 --> 00:31:28,904
"That's true. But I don't think the man will leave yet. He's eating some eggs."

433
00:31:30,044 --> 00:31:30,984
Paul ran off.

434
00:31:32,205 --> 00:31:33,804
Emil felt much happier.

435
00:31:34,804 --> 00:31:38,564
Friends are a great help when you are in trouble.

436
00:31:38,624 --> 00:31:39,684
Emil watched the thief.

437
00:31:40,404 --> 00:31:41,744
He was enjoying his meal.

438
00:31:42,565 --> 00:31:45,624
Perhaps he was paying for the food with Mrs Fisher's money.

439
00:31:46,824 --> 00:31:48,004
But things were different now.

440
00:31:48,844 --> 00:31:50,404
Emil had help at last.

441
00:31:54,244 --> 00:31:56,904
Ten minutes later, Emil heard the horn again.

442
00:31:57,804 --> 00:32:01,243
He saw about twenty boys coming up the road towards him.

443
00:32:02,203 --> 00:32:03,243
Paul was in front.

444
00:32:04,283 --> 00:32:07,083
"What do you think of this?" he asked Emil.

445
00:32:08,484 --> 00:32:11,643
"Great," said Emil, looking at all the boys.

446
00:32:12,803 --> 00:32:15,563
"I've told them what happened," Paul continued.

447
00:32:16,324 --> 00:32:17,783
He turned to the other boys.

448
00:32:18,723 --> 00:32:26,623
"This is Emil. And the man who stole his money is sitting in that cafe. He mustn't escape."

449
00:32:28,063 --> 00:32:31,844
"We'll soon catch him," said a boy with a loud voice.

450
00:32:33,004 --> 00:32:35,123
"This is the Captain," Paul said.

451
00:32:36,083 --> 00:32:39,143
He then told Emil the names of all the other boys.

452
00:32:40,603 --> 00:32:48,184
"Well," said the Captain wisely, "we must begin. First, everyone must give me their money."

453
00:32:49,863 --> 00:32:52,323
Each boy threw his money into Emil's cap.

454
00:32:53,203 --> 00:32:58,103
A very small boy called Little Tuesday put five pence into the cap.

455
00:32:58,743 --> 00:33:02,423
He was very excited because it was his job to count the money.

456
00:33:03,943 --> 00:33:07,763
"We have eighty-five pence," Little Tuesday reported.

457
00:33:08,564 --> 00:33:14,223
"Three of us will keep the money. If we can't stay together, there'll always be someone with money."

458
00:33:15,403 --> 00:33:17,383
"Good idea," said the Captain.

459
00:33:18,344 --> 00:33:21,043
He and Emil each kept twenty pence.

460
00:33:21,823 --> 00:33:22,823
Paul took the rest.

461
00:33:24,384 --> 00:33:36,343
Emil thanked everyone and said: "I'll return the money after we catch the thief. But I can't do much with this case and these flowers. I'd like to leave them somewhere safe."

462
00:33:37,823 --> 00:33:39,423
"Give them to me," said Paul.

463
00:33:40,024 --> 00:33:48,963
"I know the man who owns that cafe. I'll leave them with him. And I'll have a good look at the thief while I'm there."

464
00:33:49,043 --> 00:33:51,083
"Be careful," said the Captain.

465
00:33:51,664 --> 00:33:55,543
"We don't want the thief to know you're watching him."

466
00:33:55,623 --> 00:34:03,083
When Paul came back, Emil said: "Now I think we should have a meeting. But not here. Everyone can see us."

467
00:34:04,523 --> 00:34:08,422
"We'll go over to the square and sit on the grass," said the Captain.

468
00:34:09,083 --> 00:34:26,642
"But some boys must stay here and watch the thief. They can be the "watchers" - two can watch the cafe and five or six others can stand along the road. If anything happens, they can run to the square. Then we'll come back here."

469
00:34:28,463 --> 00:34:31,522
"I'll choose the watchers," Paul said to Emil and the Captain.

470
00:34:32,143 --> 00:34:39,902
"And I'll stay here too and watch the cafe. You take the rest of the boys with you. Hurry. It's getting late now."

471
00:34:41,623 --> 00:34:43,202
Paul chose the boys that he needed.

472
00:34:43,882 --> 00:34:47,202
The rest went to the square with Emil and the Captain.

473
00:34:50,162 --> 00:34:50,162
***

474
00:34:50,302 --> 00:34:55,282
They sat down on two long seats in the middle of the square by the grass.

475
00:34:55,342 --> 00:34:56,783
They all looked very serious.

476
00:34:57,702 --> 00:35:01,103
Then the Captain began to speak in a loud voice.

477
00:35:02,022 --> 00:35:05,882
His father was a soldier and always spoke like that when he gave orders.

478
00:35:07,122 --> 00:35:20,902
"It's possible," the Captain said, "that later we won't be able to stay together. If that happens, we'll need a telephone. Who has a telephone at home that they can use?"

479
00:35:22,162 --> 00:35:24,442
"I have," Little Tuesday called out.

480
00:35:25,082 --> 00:35:27,042
"My family's out at the cinema tonight."

481
00:35:28,202 --> 00:35:31,242
"And what's your telephone number?" the Captain asked.

482
00:35:32,222 --> 00:35:34,542
"West 5478."

483
00:35:35,823 --> 00:35:37,162
The Captain thought for a minute.

484
00:35:38,242 --> 00:35:39,802
He turned to a boy named John.

485
00:35:41,062 --> 00:36:10,423
"Take this pencil and paper. Cut the paper into twenty pieces. Write Little Tuesday's telephone number clearly on each piece. Then give everyone a piece of paper with the number on it. Little Tuesday's house can be our telephone office. Our detectives must telephone that office when anything new happens. And when we want to know the news, we can telephone that number, too."

486
00:36:11,782 --> 00:36:14,782
"But I'm not at home," said Little Tuesday.

487
00:36:15,782 --> 00:36:18,602
"No, but you will be," the Captain answered.

488
00:36:19,202 --> 00:36:28,222
"Listen to me. We'll finish talking, and then you'll go home and sit by the telephone. It's very important work."

489
00:36:29,843 --> 00:36:31,582
John gave out the pieces of paper.

490
00:36:32,323 --> 00:36:35,082
Each boy put his piece carefully in his pocket.

491
00:36:36,003 --> 00:37:06,982
The Captain continued: "Some of you must follow the thief. But the others must stay here in the square. Then we'll know where you are. We'll find you if we need you. You can go home now. Tell your families that you'll be very late tonight. But one after the other, not all at the same time. John, you can go home with Little Tuesday. Run back here when there's something to report. I think that's all, isn't it?"

492
00:37:08,282 --> 00:37:10,402
"We'll need something to eat," said Emil.

493
00:37:11,602 --> 00:37:13,462
Five boys ran off to get some food.

494
00:37:15,022 --> 00:37:18,562
"I think you're all being silly," said a boy called Peter.

495
00:37:19,182 --> 00:37:27,143
"You're talking about food and telephones. But we need to talk about catching this thief. How are we going to catch him?"

496
00:37:28,863 --> 00:37:32,962
"Can we get his fingerprints?" said a boy who read a lot of detective stories.

497
00:37:34,082 --> 00:37:36,003
"Of course not!" said John.

498
00:37:36,582 --> 00:37:40,683
"We can only hope to get back the money that he's stolen."

499
00:37:40,762 --> 00:37:47,202
"But if we steal the money from him," said the Captain, "we'll be thieves too."

500
00:37:47,282 --> 00:37:49,042
"That's right," said Emil.

501
00:37:49,102 --> 00:37:52,242
"It's wrong to take something from someone if he doesn't know about it."

502
00:37:54,503 --> 00:37:56,782
"OK, we've talked enough," said the Captain.

503
00:37:57,301 --> 00:38:05,881
"Now let's do something. We don't know yet how we're going to catch this man. But one thing's sure: he must give back the money."

504
00:38:07,781 --> 00:38:12,301
"I didn't understand what you said about stealing," said Little Tuesday.

505
00:38:13,062 --> 00:38:19,301
"How can I steal something that belongs to me? I own it, even if it is in another person's pocket."

506
00:38:20,681 --> 00:38:22,781
"You're too young," said the Captain.

507
00:38:23,441 --> 00:38:24,721
"You can't understand."

508
00:38:26,421 --> 00:38:29,281
"Are you sure we can all be good detectives?" asked Peter.

509
00:38:30,101 --> 00:38:33,002
"We don't want the thief to know what's happening. He'll escape."

510
00:38:34,301 --> 00:38:38,101
"Yes, we'll need some good detectives," cried Little Tuesday.

511
00:38:38,781 --> 00:38:45,721
"That's why you need me! I can be a wonderful police dog, too. I can make a noise like a dog."

512
00:38:46,961 --> 00:38:47,961
Nobody listened to him.

513
00:38:49,221 --> 00:38:51,741
"Perhaps the thief has a gun," said Peter.

514
00:38:52,921 --> 00:38:55,822
"Then we need brave detectives," said Emil.

515
00:38:56,381 --> 00:38:59,081
"If anyone's afraid, they can go home to bed."

516
00:39:00,461 --> 00:39:01,381
Nobody moved.

517
00:39:02,642 --> 00:39:05,061
"There's one more thing," Emil continued.

518
00:39:05,661 --> 00:39:17,201
"I must send news to my grandmother. She doesn't know where I am. She'll go to the police, and we don't want that. Can someone take a letter to 15 Bridge Street for me?"

519
00:39:18,301 --> 00:39:20,841
"I'll do it," said a boy called Robert.

520
00:39:22,182 --> 00:39:24,042
Emil asked for a pencil and paper.

521
00:39:24,801 --> 00:39:26,182
He wrote:

522
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:27,621
Dear Grandmother,

523
00:39:28,561 --> 00:39:31,021
You probably want to know where I am.

524
00:39:32,061 --> 00:39:33,401
Please don't worry.

525
00:39:34,301 --> 00:39:35,281
I am in the city.

526
00:39:36,521 --> 00:39:40,002
I cannot see you yet because I have some important business.

527
00:39:40,981 --> 00:39:43,822
But when everything is finished, I will come.

528
00:39:45,142 --> 00:39:48,322
Do not ask what this business is.

529
00:39:48,381 --> 00:39:51,221
The boy who is bringing you this letter is a friend.

530
00:39:52,182 --> 00:39:54,101
He knows where I am.

531
00:39:54,161 --> 00:39:57,260
But he cannot tell you because it is a secret.

532
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:00,880
Give my love to Uncle, Aunt and Polly.

533
00:40:01,501 --> 00:40:02,500
Your loving grandson,

534
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:03,380
Emil

535
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:10,380
Emil wrote the number of the house and the name of the street on the other side of the paper.

536
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:12,000
Robert took it.

537
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:16,700
The Captain gave him the money for his tram ticket, and Robert hurried away.

538
00:40:18,021 --> 00:40:19,860
The five boys came back with the food.

539
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:23,160
Emil gave some food to each of the detectives.

540
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:25,700
Some of the boys were still at home.

541
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:29,020
Their families did not want them to come out again.

542
00:40:30,641 --> 00:40:33,220
The Captain then gave them all a secret word.

543
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:38,200
The word was "Emil", because it was easy to remember.

544
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:42,860
When they phoned Little Tuesday, they had to say this word first.

545
00:40:43,801 --> 00:40:46,180
If a caller knew the word, they were a friend.

546
00:40:47,781 --> 00:40:57,840
The Captain turned to Little Tuesday: "Please telephone my father. Tell him that I have some important business. I won't be home until late."

547
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:00,840
"All right," said Little Tuesday.

548
00:41:01,501 --> 00:41:03,260
He went home, taking John with him.

549
00:41:04,961 --> 00:41:07,961
"Won't your father be angry?" asked Emil in surprise.

550
00:41:09,101 --> 00:41:12,260
"My father knows I'm sensible," answered the Captain.

551
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:19,480
"I've promised him that I'll never do anything wrong. I can do what I like. But I mustn't break that promise."

552
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:23,840
"Why aren't all fathers like that?" said Peter.

553
00:41:24,821 --> 00:41:27,001
The Captain turned to the rest of the boys.

554
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,740
"I'll leave my money here," he said.

555
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:49,920
"We have enough without it. Gerald, you must be the chief. Wait here until we send for you. John will come from Little Tuesday's house if we need help. Are there any more questions? Is everything clear? Our secret word is "Emil". Don't forget."

556
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:55,320
"Secret word: "Emil"," the boys cried loudly.

557
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,879
All the people in the square looked at them with surprise.

558
00:42:00,119 --> 00:42:02,399
Emil was really enjoying himself now.

559
00:42:03,659 --> 00:42:06,799
"I'm almost glad that thief stole my money," he thought.

560
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:09,679
CHAPTER FIVE

561
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:11,379
Following the Thief

562
00:42:13,199 --> 00:42:16,539
Three of the watchers ran into the square waving their arms.

563
00:42:17,339 --> 00:42:18,419
This was the sign.

564
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:21,299
Mr Green was leaving the cafe!

565
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:29,319
"Let's go!" the Captain cried, and he, Emil and three other boys ran back to Paul.

566
00:42:30,159 --> 00:42:32,979
He was waiting for them in the doorway of the house.

567
00:42:34,279 --> 00:42:38,659
The thief was standing outside the cafe, buying a newspaper.

568
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:42,260
He opened the newspaper and began to read.

569
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:51,319
"He's looking over the top of the newspaper. He wants to see if anyone's watching him," said Emil.

570
00:42:52,599 --> 00:42:58,740
"I watched him very carefully," said Paul, "and he didn't look at me once. He just continued eating."

571
00:43:00,339 --> 00:43:04,019
The thief put the newspaper in his pocket and looked around him.

572
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,219
A taxi came past.

573
00:43:06,999 --> 00:43:08,920
He shouted and it stopped.

574
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:13,439
He got in, shut the door, and the taxi drove away.

575
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,439
The boys got into another taxi.

576
00:43:17,539 --> 00:43:20,499
"Follow that taxi," Paul said to the driver.

577
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:26,960
"Follow it carefully, please. The man inside mustn't see us. We're following him."

578
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:31,099
"What's the matter?" the taxi driver asked.

579
00:43:32,059 --> 00:43:33,780
"It's a secret," Paul said.

580
00:43:34,539 --> 00:43:36,060
"The man's done something wrong."

581
00:43:37,499 --> 00:43:39,699
"All right, but have you got any money?"

582
00:43:40,619 --> 00:43:41,259
"Of course!"

583
00:43:42,799 --> 00:43:43,959
They drove through the streets.

584
00:43:44,619 --> 00:43:49,379
A few people looked surprised when they saw so many boys in one taxi.

585
00:43:49,439 --> 00:43:53,299
"Down! Down!" Paul said in a low voice.

586
00:43:53,979 --> 00:43:56,519
The boys threw themselves on the floor of the taxi.

587
00:43:57,918 --> 00:44:00,019
"What's the matter?" asked the Captain.

588
00:44:01,158 --> 00:44:12,798
"The traffic lights are red. We can't move until they change. The other taxi's stopped too, and we're just behind it. If the man turns round, he'll see us."

589
00:44:14,539 --> 00:44:17,498
The driver looked round at the boys and began to laugh.

590
00:44:18,519 --> 00:44:20,118
Then the lights changed to green.

591
00:44:20,798 --> 00:44:23,718
The boys got off the floor and sat in their seats again.

592
00:44:25,378 --> 00:44:29,039
"I hope this isn't going to be a long journey," said the Captain.

593
00:44:29,798 --> 00:44:31,138
He was thinking about the money.

594
00:44:32,618 --> 00:44:37,078
But soon the first taxi stopped in a square at the door of a hotel.

595
00:44:38,039 --> 00:44:42,219
The thief got out, paid the driver and went into the hotel.

596
00:44:43,658 --> 00:44:45,859
"Follow him, Paul," said the Captain.

597
00:44:46,359 --> 00:44:48,998
"If the hotel has another door, he'll escape."

598
00:44:50,359 --> 00:44:54,039
Paul ran after the thief and the other boys got out of the taxi.

599
00:44:54,938 --> 00:44:56,039
Emil paid the driver.

600
00:44:56,678 --> 00:45:02,318
Then they followed the Captain through a gateway and into a large courtyard behind a cinema.

601
00:45:03,458 --> 00:45:06,718
The Captain sent a boy called Tony after Paul.

602
00:45:08,258 --> 00:45:11,358
"I hope the thief stays in that hotel," Emil said.

603
00:45:11,879 --> 00:45:17,678
"We can watch him easily from here. This courtyard is a wonderful place for our head office."

604
00:45:18,858 --> 00:45:24,559
"Yes, and it's near the trams and the post office telephones, too," the Captain agreed.

605
00:45:25,658 --> 00:45:27,898
He sat on a seat in the courtyard.

606
00:45:27,958 --> 00:45:32,158
He looked very serious, like someone who was planning a war.

607
00:45:33,898 --> 00:45:34,739
Paul came back.

608
00:45:35,938 --> 00:45:41,059
"The thief took a room in the hotel," he said, excitedly.

609
00:45:41,118 --> 00:45:46,678
"And there's only one way out. I checked. We've got him."

610
00:45:46,758 --> 00:45:49,718
"Is Tony watching the hotel?" the Captain asked.

611
00:45:50,458 --> 00:45:52,798
"Of course."

612
00:45:52,879 --> 00:45:55,278
The Captain gave a boy called Walter some money.

613
00:45:56,118 --> 00:45:57,757
"Phone Little Tuesday," he said.

614
00:45:58,837 --> 00:46:00,337
Walter ran to the post office.

615
00:46:01,338 --> 00:46:02,517
"Is that you, Tuesday?"

616
00:46:03,418 --> 00:46:05,677
"Speaking," Little Tuesday replied.

617
00:46:06,818 --> 00:46:21,537
"Secret word: "Emil". Walter speaking. The thief is staying at the West End Hotel, Princess Square. Our head office is in the courtyard behind the West End Cinema."

618
00:46:23,377 --> 00:46:29,557
Little Tuesday wrote everything down very carefully, and then Walter told him about the taxi journey.

619
00:46:30,658 --> 00:46:34,138
"Why can't I be there with you?" Little Tuesday said.

620
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:37,657
He felt sad and lonely, sitting by the telephone.

621
00:46:39,017 --> 00:46:40,417
"Have any of the others phoned you?"

622
00:46:41,278 --> 00:46:41,717
"No."

623
00:46:42,517 --> 00:46:44,317
"OK. Goodbye, for now."

624
00:46:45,697 --> 00:46:47,197
Walter went back to the courtyard.

625
00:46:47,657 --> 00:46:48,557
It was getting late.

626
00:46:50,097 --> 00:46:53,278
"I'm sure we won't catch him today," said Paul.

627
00:46:54,577 --> 00:46:56,977
The boys thought deeply for some time.

628
00:46:57,597 --> 00:46:59,337
The sky was growing dark.

629
00:47:00,217 --> 00:47:02,077
They weren't sure what to do next.

630
00:47:03,097 --> 00:47:04,978
Suddenly they heard a bell.

631
00:47:05,777 --> 00:47:06,717
It was coming nearer.

632
00:47:07,857 --> 00:47:10,938
A shining new bicycle came into the courtyard.

633
00:47:11,677 --> 00:47:15,297
A girl was riding it, and behind her was Robert.

634
00:47:16,277 --> 00:47:20,197
Emil jumped up and said: "That's my cousin, Polly."

635
00:47:21,618 --> 00:47:24,618
The Captain offered Polly his seat and she sat down.

636
00:47:26,097 --> 00:47:28,118
"Well, Emil," Polly began.

637
00:47:28,677 --> 00:47:38,177
"We were just going to the station to meet the next train from Newton. Then your friend Robert arrived with the letter. You have some very nice friends."

638
00:47:39,217 --> 00:47:40,917
Robert looked pleased.

639
00:47:40,978 --> 00:48:00,576
"And now," Polly continued, "Father and Mother and Grandmother are probably asking where I am. I didn't tell them anything. I just left the house with Robert. We phoned your office and spoke to Little Tuesday. And so here we are. But I must go back home now."

640
00:48:01,976 --> 00:48:04,336
"Were the family angry with me?" asked Emil.

641
00:48:05,337 --> 00:48:12,336
"No. Grandmother just talked and talked until Father and Mother told her to be quiet." Polly stood up.

642
00:48:13,136 --> 00:48:17,077
"I hope you catch your thief tomorrow. Who's your chief detective?"

643
00:48:18,356 --> 00:48:19,836
"This boy," said Emil.

644
00:48:20,616 --> 00:48:21,556
"He's the Captain."

645
00:48:23,077 --> 00:48:26,136
"I'm pleased to meet a real detective," said Polly.

646
00:48:26,996 --> 00:48:28,756
The Captain looked proud of himself.

647
00:48:29,716 --> 00:48:31,856
"And now I must go," Polly said.

648
00:48:32,316 --> 00:48:34,656
"I'll come back in the morning. Goodbye."

649
00:48:35,956 --> 00:48:38,597
Polly rang the bell on her bicycle and rode away.

650
00:48:40,456 --> 00:48:40,456
***

651
00:48:40,536 --> 00:48:41,936
Time passed slowly.

652
00:48:43,136 --> 00:48:47,436
Emil went to see Walter and Tony, the two boys who were guarding the hotel.

653
00:48:48,356 --> 00:48:52,276
Then he went to the hotel, looked in and went back to the courtyard.

654
00:48:53,776 --> 00:48:55,796
"We can't go home," he said.

655
00:48:56,336 --> 00:49:06,116
"Someone should stay and watch for us. There's a boy in the hotel who works in the lift. Let's speak to him. Perhaps he'll help us."

656
00:49:07,257 --> 00:49:09,576
"That's a good idea," said the Captain.

657
00:49:09,956 --> 00:49:12,336
"You're not as silly as most people from the country."

658
00:49:13,636 --> 00:49:16,937
"City people don't know everything," Emil replied.

659
00:49:17,596 --> 00:49:18,656
He felt a little angry.

660
00:49:19,956 --> 00:49:22,216
The other boys didn't want the thief to see Emil.

661
00:49:22,636 --> 00:49:26,276
So Paul went to speak to the lift boy.

662
00:49:26,336 --> 00:49:28,776
Emil and the Captain went out of the courtyard.

663
00:49:29,556 --> 00:49:32,077
They stood by the gateway eating bread and butter.

664
00:49:33,176 --> 00:49:34,476
It was nearly night time.

665
00:49:35,156 --> 00:49:37,816
Electric lights shone everywhere.

666
00:49:37,876 --> 00:49:42,956
The noise of trams, bicycles and taxis seemed even louder now.

667
00:49:43,757 --> 00:49:46,516
There was dance music coming from the West End Hotel.

668
00:49:47,176 --> 00:49:49,256
Crowds of people were going into the cinema.

669
00:49:51,077 --> 00:50:03,296
"The city is wonderful, of course," Emil said, "but I wouldn't like to live here all the time. Newton is much smaller, but it's big enough for me. There's too much noise here."

670
00:50:04,475 --> 00:50:06,735
"I like the city," said the Captain.

671
00:50:07,156 --> 00:50:09,575
"And if you live here, you don't notice the noise."

672
00:50:11,475 --> 00:50:16,016
About an hour later, Peter and a number of other boys came into the courtyard.

673
00:50:16,815 --> 00:50:18,375
They were carrying a lot of food.

674
00:50:19,415 --> 00:50:21,516
The Captain was very angry.

675
00:50:22,516 --> 00:50:25,295
"What are you doing here?" he shouted.

676
00:50:25,795 --> 00:50:28,215
"I told you to stay in the square."

677
00:50:29,516 --> 00:50:31,295
"Don't shout," said Peter.

678
00:50:31,876 --> 00:50:33,395
"We want to know what's happening here."

679
00:50:35,016 --> 00:50:39,196
"John didn't come from Little Tuesday's house with any news," said Gerald.

680
00:50:39,516 --> 00:50:42,455
"So we thought something was wrong. That's why we came."

681
00:50:43,375 --> 00:50:46,475
"How many boys are in the square?" asked the Captain.

682
00:50:47,715 --> 00:50:50,735
"Three or four," said one of the boys.

683
00:50:51,635 --> 00:50:54,955
"No, I think there are only two," said another.

684
00:50:55,475 --> 00:50:57,915
"That's enough!" shouted the Captain.

685
00:50:58,455 --> 00:51:00,075
"Is there anyone in the square?"

686
00:51:01,336 --> 00:51:03,255
"Stop shouting," said Peter.

687
00:51:03,515 --> 00:51:05,096
"You can't tell us what to do."

688
00:51:06,615 --> 00:51:09,836
"I don't think you should be a detective," said the Captain.

689
00:51:10,175 --> 00:51:11,135
"We don't want you."

690
00:51:12,376 --> 00:51:14,955
Peter said some rude words and went away.

691
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:17,995
A boy came through the gateway.

692
00:51:18,575 --> 00:51:22,115
He was dressed in green and there was a green cap on his head.

693
00:51:23,355 --> 00:51:25,755
"Is that the lift boy?" asked the Captain.

694
00:51:27,056 --> 00:51:28,115
Nobody answered.

695
00:51:29,295 --> 00:51:31,475
The boy came towards them.

696
00:51:31,535 --> 00:51:35,795
Suddenly a horn sounded and the boy in green began to laugh.

697
00:51:36,475 --> 00:51:38,255
It was Paul.

698
00:51:38,315 --> 00:51:40,755
"Don't you know me?" he asked.

699
00:51:41,915 --> 00:51:43,115
Everyone laughed.

700
00:51:44,035 --> 00:51:50,875
A window above the courtyard opened and someone shouted: "Be quiet down there!"

701
00:51:50,955 --> 00:51:53,215
The Captain looked serious.

702
00:51:53,275 --> 00:51:55,395
"We mustn't make a noise," he said.

703
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:58,394
"Come here, Paul. Why are you dressed like that?"

704
00:51:59,534 --> 00:52:22,754
"Well, I went to the hotel," Paul began, "and the lift boy was standing by the lift. I waved and he came over to me. I told him everything about Emil and the thief. He wanted to help, so he gave me some of his clothes. "People will think you're another lift boy," he said. "You can watch the thief.

705
00:52:23,374 --> 00:52:24,914
He won't know who you really are."

706
00:52:26,074 --> 00:52:27,954
And that's why I'm wearing these clothes."

707
00:52:29,615 --> 00:52:32,834
"But what about the hotel doorman?" Emil asked.

708
00:52:33,835 --> 00:52:36,734
"The lift boy told him about us," replied Paul.

709
00:52:37,254 --> 00:53:09,574
"The hotel doorman is the lift boy's father. So it's OK. Now I can stay there all night. And I can take one of you with me, too. The thief is in room 61. I went up and stood near the door in these clothes and watched. After about half an hour, he came out and went to the toilet at the end of the corridor. When he came back, I stepped in front of him. "Is there anything I can do for you, sir?"

710
00:53:10,234 --> 00:53:10,694
I asked.

711
00:53:11,554 --> 00:53:12,834
"Oh yes," he said.

712
00:53:13,474 --> 00:53:17,574
"Tell them to call me at eight o'clock tomorrow morning. Don't forget."

713
00:53:18,534 --> 00:53:19,894
"Yes, sir," I said.

714
00:53:20,754 --> 00:53:22,614
Then he went back into his room."

715
00:53:24,455 --> 00:53:27,914
The Captain was very pleased and thanked Paul.

716
00:53:27,974 --> 00:53:28,995
Emil thanked him, too.

717
00:53:29,754 --> 00:53:32,934
Now everyone was very excited about the next day.

718
00:53:33,654 --> 00:53:38,654
They were all thinking the same thing: "Tomorrow we'll catch the thief."

719
00:53:40,234 --> 00:53:43,275
"We can't do anything more tonight," said the Captain.

720
00:53:43,714 --> 00:53:56,894
"You can all go home to bed. But you must be back here early tomorrow morning. And try to bring some more money. I'll phone Little Tuesday now, and tell him to send the others home."

721
00:53:58,353 --> 00:54:00,953
"I'll go to the hotel with Paul," Emil said.

722
00:54:03,154 --> 00:54:05,113
Soon everyone was asleep.

723
00:54:06,313 --> 00:54:10,113
Most of the boys were in their beds at home, but not all of them.

724
00:54:11,113 --> 00:54:19,913
Paul and Emil were sleeping in a room at the West End Hotel, and Little Tuesday was asleep in his father's chair next to the telephone.

725
00:54:20,753 --> 00:54:23,373
He was dreaming of hundreds of telephone calls.

726
00:54:24,653 --> 00:54:28,714
Sometime later, Little Tuesday's father and mother came home.

727
00:54:29,574 --> 00:54:31,773
They were surprised to find him asleep in a chair.

728
00:54:32,993 --> 00:54:35,013
His mother carried him up the stairs.

729
00:54:36,493 --> 00:54:43,133
"Secret word: "Emil", secret word: "Emil"," Little Tuesday said in his sleep.

730
00:54:44,234 --> 00:54:46,973
Of course, his mother didn't understand.

731
00:54:50,833 --> 00:54:51,673
CHAPTER SIX

732
00:54:52,473 --> 00:54:53,773
The Thief Is Caught!

733
00:54:55,933 --> 00:54:58,313
Early next morning, the thief was dressing.

734
00:54:59,033 --> 00:55:03,974
He looked out of his window and noticed a large crowd of boys in the street below.

735
00:55:04,974 --> 00:55:07,453
Some of them were playing football in Princess Square.

736
00:55:08,133 --> 00:55:09,894
The others were standing there, talking.

737
00:55:11,033 --> 00:55:14,353
"The schools are probably closed today," he thought.

738
00:55:15,434 --> 00:55:20,413
At the same time, the Captain was having a meeting in the courtyard at the back of the cinema.

739
00:55:21,313 --> 00:55:25,394
There were more boys than before and he was very angry again.

740
00:55:26,894 --> 00:55:31,373
"I didn't want you to tell anyone about our plan," he shouted.

741
00:55:31,853 --> 00:55:39,673
"And what do you do? You bring a lot of boys that we don't know. Our plan was a secret. It isn't now."

742
00:55:41,133 --> 00:55:43,434
"Don't be angry, Captain," said Gerald.

743
00:55:43,754 --> 00:55:44,733
"We'll catch the thief."

744
00:55:46,373 --> 00:55:48,893
"You can send all these boys home," said Walter.

745
00:55:49,333 --> 00:55:51,373
He was trying to help.

746
00:55:51,434 --> 00:55:53,313
"No, I can't," said the Captain.

747
00:55:53,373 --> 00:55:55,773
"They won't go."

748
00:55:55,853 --> 00:55:58,373
"There's only one thing to do, then," said Emil.

749
00:55:58,913 --> 00:56:21,452
"We must change our plans. We can't follow the thief secretly now; there are too many boys. So he must see what we're doing. When he comes out of the hotel, we'll make a circle of boys around him. That circle will follow him everywhere he goes. He won't be able to escape."

750
00:56:22,572 --> 00:56:24,592
"Good idea!" said the Captain.

751
00:56:25,072 --> 00:56:26,532
"I was thinking that, too."

752
00:56:28,093 --> 00:56:31,832
"The boys in the circle should make a lot of noise," said Emil.

753
00:56:32,472 --> 00:56:40,712
"Then other people will notice what's happening. The thief will want to give us the money back before the police arrive."

754
00:56:42,353 --> 00:56:44,272
There was the sound of a bell at the gateway.

755
00:56:44,912 --> 00:56:46,092
Everyone turned round.

756
00:56:46,972 --> 00:56:48,592
Polly rode into the courtyard.

757
00:56:49,552 --> 00:56:52,052
"Good morning, detectives," she said.

758
00:56:52,812 --> 00:56:55,992
She jumped off her bicycle and took a bag from the front.

759
00:56:57,072 --> 00:56:59,372
"I've brought you some coffee," she said.

760
00:56:59,853 --> 00:57:00,692
"And some food."

761
00:57:02,033 --> 00:57:03,933
The boys weren't really hungry.

762
00:57:04,492 --> 00:57:06,792
It was too soon after breakfast to eat again.

763
00:57:07,533 --> 00:57:10,312
But they didn't want to be rude, so they took the bag.

764
00:57:10,832 --> 00:57:12,652
They ate and drank everything.

765
00:57:13,972 --> 00:57:15,853
Suddenly they heard Paul's horn.

766
00:57:16,272 --> 00:57:22,412
He ran into the courtyard, shouting: "Quick! Let's go! The thief's leaving the hotel."

767
00:57:24,033 --> 00:57:26,072
All the boys ran through the gateway.

768
00:57:26,792 --> 00:57:29,573
Polly was left alone with her bicycle and the empty bag.

769
00:57:30,272 --> 00:57:31,652
She wasn't very pleased.

770
00:57:32,332 --> 00:57:36,213
She jumped on her bicycle and rode after the boys.

771
00:57:36,272 --> 00:57:40,912
"I don't like it! I don't like it!" she said.

772
00:57:40,972 --> 00:57:43,992
She sounded like her grandmother.

773
00:57:44,052 --> 00:57:48,112
The thief came out of the hotel and turned to the right.

774
00:57:48,173 --> 00:57:52,312
The Captain sent Tony and Walter to the different groups of boys.

775
00:57:52,872 --> 00:57:54,012
They gave them their orders.

776
00:57:54,892 --> 00:57:59,531
In three minutes there was a large crowd of boys all around the thief.

777
00:58:00,291 --> 00:58:01,331
He didn't know what to do.

778
00:58:02,092 --> 00:58:05,911
The boys were talking, laughing and following him everywhere.

779
00:58:07,112 --> 00:58:09,911
"And why are they looking at me all the time?" he thought.

780
00:58:10,691 --> 00:58:12,531
He couldn't understand what was happening.

781
00:58:13,831 --> 00:58:16,491
Suddenly a ball flew past his head.

782
00:58:17,571 --> 00:58:20,151
He didn't like that and began to walk more quickly.

783
00:58:20,831 --> 00:58:22,571
But the boys walked faster, too.

784
00:58:23,531 --> 00:58:28,271
He tried to turn into a side street, but another crowd of boys stood in his way.

785
00:58:29,692 --> 00:58:32,012
"Walk in front of me," Emil said to Paul.

786
00:58:32,411 --> 00:58:34,211
"The thief mustn't see me yet."

787
00:58:35,672 --> 00:58:38,812
Polly rode at the side of the crowd, ringing her little bell.

788
00:58:39,951 --> 00:58:42,671
The thief was feeling more and more nervous.

789
00:58:43,231 --> 00:58:45,011
He didn't know what he should do next.

790
00:58:45,731 --> 00:58:48,791
He tried walking faster, but he couldn't escape.

791
00:58:49,891 --> 00:58:53,771
Suddenly he turned round and ran back along the street.

792
00:58:54,611 --> 00:58:55,651
The crowd followed.

793
00:58:56,191 --> 00:58:59,791
Then Walter ran in front of the thief and the man nearly fell.

794
00:59:00,911 --> 00:59:03,712
"What's the matter with you?" Mr Green shouted.

795
00:59:04,091 --> 00:59:06,531
"Go away, or I'll call a policeman."

796
00:59:07,611 --> 00:59:09,811
"Oh, yes please," said Walter.

797
00:59:10,212 --> 00:59:11,391
"That's what we're waiting for."

798
00:59:13,051 --> 00:59:16,111
Of course, the thief didn't want to call a policeman.

799
00:59:16,951 --> 00:59:17,631
He looked up.

800
00:59:18,391 --> 00:59:20,531
People were looking at him from their windows.

801
00:59:21,212 --> 00:59:22,751
Was anyone phoning the police?

802
00:59:23,831 --> 00:59:30,951
"If the police come," he thought, "they'll start asking questions." He was beginning to feel afraid.

803
00:59:31,471 --> 00:59:32,851
He didn't know what to do.

804
00:59:34,151 --> 00:59:37,471
Then he saw a bank across the road.

805
00:59:37,532 --> 00:59:38,751
It gave him an idea.

806
00:59:40,151 --> 00:59:43,451
He ran through the crowd of boys and hurried into the bank.

807
00:59:44,531 --> 00:59:45,511
The boys followed.

808
00:59:46,451 --> 01:00:08,990
The Captain stopped them at the door and said: "Paul and I will go inside. Emil can stay here until we're ready for him. When Paul sounds his horn, Emil and ten boys must come into the bank." He turned to Emil: "Bring some good boys, Emil. This will be a difficult business."

809
01:00:10,870 --> 01:00:13,090
Paul and the Captain walked into the bank.

810
01:00:13,910 --> 01:00:16,390
Mr Green was standing in front of a desk.

811
01:00:17,070 --> 01:00:21,430
Behind the desk, a bank assistant was having a telephone conversation.

812
01:00:22,810 --> 01:00:24,930
The Captain got close to the thief.

813
01:00:25,670 --> 01:00:30,510
Paul stood behind him, with his hand in his pocket, ready to sound his horn.

814
01:00:32,090 --> 01:00:35,291
The bank assistant finished telephoning and came to the desk.

815
01:00:36,730 --> 01:00:39,390
"What can I do for you?" he asked Mr Green.

816
01:00:40,610 --> 01:00:53,770
"Can you change these seventy pounds for me, please? I'd like five-pound notes for the ten-pound notes, and one-pound notes for the five-pound notes." He took the money out of his pocket.

817
01:00:55,070 --> 01:00:57,230
"Stop!" the Captain called out.

818
01:00:57,690 --> 01:00:59,230
"That money was stolen."

819
01:01:00,590 --> 01:01:03,390
"What!" said the bank assistant in surprise.

820
01:01:04,371 --> 01:01:06,810
The other people in the bank looked up from their work.

821
01:01:08,011 --> 01:01:12,550
"This man stole that money from my friend," said the Captain.

822
01:01:13,130 --> 01:01:17,670
"But if he changes the money into smaller notes, nobody can prove it."

823
01:01:18,810 --> 01:01:22,170
"You crazy boy!" shouted Mr Green.

824
01:01:22,910 --> 01:01:24,570
He hit the Captain in the face.

825
01:01:25,310 --> 01:01:28,130
The Captain hit him back, hard, in the stomach.

826
01:01:28,770 --> 01:01:31,930
All the bank workers ran to the desk to watch.

827
01:01:31,990 --> 01:01:33,530
Paul sounded his horn.

828
01:01:34,450 --> 01:01:37,170
Ten boys came running into the bank.

829
01:01:37,230 --> 01:01:38,310
Emil was in front.

830
01:01:38,690 --> 01:01:40,670
They all stood around Mr Green.

831
01:01:42,870 --> 01:01:44,971
The bank manager came out of his office.

832
01:01:46,011 --> 01:01:49,230
"What's all this noise about?" he asked.

833
01:01:49,291 --> 01:01:51,790
Emil pointed to the thief.

834
01:01:51,850 --> 01:02:00,369
"Yesterday afternoon, this man here stole my money. He took it while I was asleep on the train from Newton."

835
01:02:01,469 --> 01:02:03,829
"Can you prove this?" the manager asked.

836
01:02:04,570 --> 01:02:05,749
Mr Green laughed.

837
01:02:06,469 --> 01:02:12,330
"Of course he can't! I've been here for a week. Yesterday I was in the city all day."

838
01:02:13,509 --> 01:02:16,809
"That isn't true!" Emil shouted angrily.

839
01:02:17,230 --> 01:02:18,609
He was almost crying.

840
01:02:19,849 --> 01:02:25,949
"Can you prove that this is the same man? The man who was on the train yesterday?" the manager asked.

841
01:02:27,129 --> 01:02:28,449
Emil thought for a minute.

842
01:02:29,230 --> 01:02:30,750
His friends began to look worried.

843
01:02:32,029 --> 01:02:35,149
"Yes, I can!" Emil said at last.

844
01:02:35,849 --> 01:02:53,569
"There was a lady in the carriage for the first part of the journey. Her name is Mrs James and she lives in Greenfield. I remember, because she asked me to speak to her friend Mr Smith. He owns a cloth shop in Newton."

845
01:02:55,089 --> 01:02:57,009
The bank manager turned to the thief.

846
01:02:57,849 --> 01:03:02,489
"And can you prove that you were in the city all day yesterday?" he asked.

847
01:03:03,209 --> 01:03:05,929
"Of course I can," the thief answered.

848
01:03:06,910 --> 01:03:11,310
"I was at the West End Hotel in Princess Square. That's where I'm staying."

849
01:03:12,569 --> 01:03:15,169
"But only since yesterday evening," Paul said.

850
01:03:15,569 --> 01:03:19,189
"I know that for a fact. I've been there, dressed as a lift boy."

851
01:03:20,590 --> 01:03:22,089
The other bank workers smiled.

852
01:03:22,669 --> 01:03:31,509
They wanted to believe the boys" story. But the bank manager looked serious. "I must keep this money for now," he said.

853
01:03:32,549 --> 01:03:36,169
He took a piece of paper and began to write down their names and addresses.

854
01:03:37,789 --> 01:03:40,489
"The man's name is Green," Emil said.

855
01:03:41,429 --> 01:03:46,029
The thief laughed loudly. "You can see that there's been a mistake.

856
01:03:46,549 --> 01:03:48,969
My name's Miller, not Green."

857
01:03:50,689 --> 01:03:54,910
"In the train yesterday, he called himself Green," Emil said.

858
01:03:56,289 --> 01:03:59,549
"Can you prove that your name's Miller?" asked the bank manager.

859
01:04:00,689 --> 01:04:06,189
"I have no papers with me," said the thief, "but I can get them from the hotel."

860
01:04:07,389 --> 01:04:09,669
"Don't believe him!" Emil cried.

861
01:04:10,029 --> 01:04:19,429
"It's my money and I must have it back. My mother asked me to take the money to my grandmother. She lives here, in Bridge Street."

862
01:04:20,809 --> 01:04:22,849
"Perhaps that's true," said the manager.

863
01:04:23,429 --> 01:04:33,869
"But I'll have to ask you again. Can you prove that the money is yours? Is your name written on the back of the notes? Did you write down their numbers?"

864
01:04:34,849 --> 01:04:36,789
"Of course not," said Emil.

865
01:04:37,189 --> 01:04:39,029
"I didn't think that I could lose the money."

866
01:04:40,549 --> 01:04:42,189
"Were there any marks on the notes?"

867
01:04:43,009 --> 01:04:44,049
"I don't think so."

868
01:04:44,989 --> 01:04:48,069
"Well, that's the end of it, then," the thief said.

869
01:04:48,509 --> 01:04:53,969
"Everything that I've told you is true. That money's mine. I never steal from children."

870
01:04:55,509 --> 01:04:57,649
"Wait a minute!" Emil cried.

871
01:04:58,289 --> 01:05:19,590
"Now I remember. There is a mark on the notes: the mark of a pin. I wanted to be sure that the money stayed in my pocket. So I put a pin through the cloth of my pocket and through the bag with the money in it. If you look closely at the notes, you'll see the holes from the pin."

872
01:05:21,490 --> 01:05:25,249
The bank manager held the notes up against the light.

873
01:05:25,310 --> 01:05:26,969
Everyone watched in silence.

874
01:05:27,770 --> 01:05:29,189
The thief stepped back.

875
01:05:30,630 --> 01:05:32,809
"The boy's right," said the manager.

876
01:05:33,629 --> 01:05:35,209
"There are holes in these notes."

877
01:05:36,450 --> 01:05:40,130
"And here's the pin that made the holes," Emil said.

878
01:05:41,109 --> 01:05:44,090
He put the pin from his jacket on the desk.

879
01:05:44,149 --> 01:05:45,469
Then he held his finger up.

880
01:05:46,269 --> 01:05:48,809
"And here's the place where I pricked myself."

881
01:05:50,049 --> 01:05:53,569
The thief turned and pushed through the crowd of boys.

882
01:05:54,410 --> 01:05:55,549
Some of them fell down.

883
01:05:56,268 --> 01:05:59,448
He ran through the door of the bank and disappeared.

884
01:06:00,289 --> 01:06:02,869
"Catch him!" cried the bank manager.

885
01:06:03,768 --> 01:06:05,148
Everyone ran to the door.

886
01:06:05,848 --> 01:06:07,228
The thief was outside.

887
01:06:08,388 --> 01:06:10,429
There were about thirty boys round him.

888
01:06:11,448 --> 01:06:17,068
Some of them held his legs, some of them held his arms and some of them held his coat.

889
01:06:17,869 --> 01:06:19,888
There was no escape for him now.

890
01:06:21,028 --> 01:06:22,869
A policeman came running towards them.

891
01:06:23,428 --> 01:06:24,348
Polly was with him.

892
01:06:25,308 --> 01:06:32,348
The bank manager said to the policeman: "Take this man to the police station. He's stolen this boy's money."

893
01:06:33,528 --> 01:06:35,288
The policeman held the thief's arm.

894
01:06:36,028 --> 01:06:37,248
"Right," he said.

895
01:06:37,668 --> 01:06:38,729
"You come along with me!"

896
01:06:40,348 --> 01:06:43,608
The bank assistant took the money and the pin and went with them.

897
01:06:44,889 --> 01:06:46,928
All the boys and Polly went too.

898
01:06:47,768 --> 01:06:48,968
They were a strange group.

899
01:06:49,948 --> 01:06:54,268
First there was the policeman and the assistant from the bank, with the thief between them.

900
01:06:55,008 --> 01:06:56,508
Then came all the boys.

901
01:06:57,028 --> 01:07:00,968
And finally, there was Polly on her shining new bicycle.

902
01:07:01,949 --> 01:07:06,589
She called to Emil: "I'm going to ride home and tell the family."

903
01:07:07,608 --> 01:07:11,528
She rang her little bell, turned into a side street and rode away.

904
01:07:15,388 --> 01:07:16,188
CHAPTER SEVEN

905
01:07:16,869 --> 01:07:18,468
Policemen and Reporters

906
01:07:20,828 --> 01:07:24,909
At the police station, the policeman told his chief everything that he knew.

907
01:07:26,028 --> 01:07:27,708
Emil added more information.

908
01:07:28,589 --> 01:07:33,589
He also had to give his name, date and place of birth, and address.

909
01:07:34,568 --> 01:07:36,388
The police chief wrote everything down.

910
01:07:37,688 --> 01:07:39,948
"And what's your name?" he asked the thief.

911
01:07:40,768 --> 01:07:43,488
"John Turner," the man answered.

912
01:07:44,468 --> 01:07:49,408
When they heard this, Emil, Paul and the Captain laughed loudly.

913
01:07:49,468 --> 01:07:52,688
Even the bank assistant laughed.

914
01:07:52,748 --> 01:08:02,827
"First his name's Green," Paul said, "then it's Miller. And now it's Turner. So what's his real name? Why don't you ask him?"

915
01:08:03,847 --> 01:08:06,247
"Silence!" said the police chief.

916
01:08:07,427 --> 01:08:11,607
Mr Green-Miller-Turner gave the date and place of his birth.

917
01:08:12,387 --> 01:08:14,347
He was staying at the West End Hotel.

918
01:08:15,187 --> 01:08:17,007
No, he couldn't prove who he was.

919
01:08:17,427 --> 01:08:18,988
He didn't have any papers with him.

920
01:08:20,367 --> 01:08:25,407
"And where were you before you came here yesterday?" the police chief asked.

921
01:08:26,387 --> 01:08:27,667
"In Greenfield."

922
01:08:29,428 --> 01:08:31,647
"That isn't true!" cried the Captain.

923
01:08:32,268 --> 01:08:34,428
"Silence!" the police chief shouted.

924
01:08:34,787 --> 01:08:35,807
He turned to the thief.

925
01:08:36,447 --> 01:08:43,367
"Mr Turner, did you steal seventy pounds from the schoolboy Emil Fisher of Newton yesterday?"

926
01:08:44,967 --> 01:08:47,167
"Yes," said the thief sadly.

927
01:08:47,847 --> 01:09:07,268
"I don't know why I did it. The boy was asleep in the corner of the carriage. I saw the bag with the money in it fall out of his pocket. So I picked it up. I only wanted to see what was in the bag. But because I didn't have any money

928
01:09:07,308 --> 01:09:12,307
"This isn't true," Emil said. "The money didn't fall out of my pocket.

929
01:09:12,607 --> 01:09:13,867
There was a pin through it."

930
01:09:15,228 --> 01:09:17,787
"And he did have some money," the Captain said.

931
01:09:18,128 --> 01:09:24,687
"He paid for food and a taxi yesterday. And today all Emil's money was still in his pocket."

932
01:09:25,787 --> 01:09:28,527
"Silence!" the police chief said again.

933
01:09:28,967 --> 01:09:32,907
"I didn't ask you to speak." He wrote everything down.

934
01:09:34,027 --> 01:09:36,307
"Can't I go, sir?" the thief asked.

935
01:09:37,107 --> 01:09:46,647
"I made a mistake and I'm sorry. You know where I'm staying. I'm in the city on business and I'd like to finish it today."

936
01:09:46,948 --> 01:09:48,847
The police chief didn't listen to him.

937
01:09:49,007 --> 01:09:54,127
He phoned the main police station for a car to take the thief away.

938
01:09:54,266 --> 01:09:56,646
"When can I get my money back?" Emil asked.

939
01:09:57,546 --> 01:10:04,606
"I don't know. They'll tell you at the main police station. You must go there now and report to the chief detective."

940
01:10:06,587 --> 01:10:10,406
The police car arrived a few minutes later and took the thief away.

941
01:10:11,347 --> 01:10:14,246
The other boys were standing outside the police station.

942
01:10:15,286 --> 01:10:16,546
Emil gave them the news.

943
01:10:17,366 --> 01:10:20,446
He asked them to telephone Little Tuesday with the news, too.

944
01:10:21,746 --> 01:10:30,586
Finally, he said: "Thank you, everyone, for all your help. Soon I'll be able to pay back the money that you lent me."

945
01:10:31,926 --> 01:10:33,966
The boys were happy to help, they said.

946
01:10:34,527 --> 01:10:35,906
They didn't want the money back.

947
01:10:37,886 --> 01:10:37,886
***

948
01:10:39,386 --> 01:10:43,306
Only Emil, Paul and the Captain went to the main police station.

949
01:10:44,266 --> 01:10:46,966
A policeman took Emil to see the chief detective.

950
01:10:47,626 --> 01:10:49,626
The others waited outside his office.

951
01:10:50,926 --> 01:10:52,926
The chief detective was a pleasant man.

952
01:10:53,486 --> 01:10:57,426
He listened to Emil's story and then gave him back the money.

953
01:10:58,707 --> 01:11:00,486
"Look after it now," he said.

954
01:11:01,186 --> 01:11:02,726
"I will," said Emil.

955
01:11:03,207 --> 01:11:04,926
"I'm going to take it to my grandmother."

956
01:11:06,387 --> 01:11:09,986
"You and your detectives did a very good job," said the chief.

957
01:11:10,866 --> 01:11:12,566
"Thank you, sir," said Emil.

958
01:11:13,286 --> 01:11:14,286
"Can I ask a question?"

959
01:11:15,067 --> 01:11:15,546
"Of course."

960
01:11:16,707 --> 01:11:18,106
"What will happen to the thief?"

961
01:11:19,426 --> 01:11:26,646
"We'll take his photograph, and his fingerprints. Then we'll check on our list of criminals. We'll see if he's there."

962
01:11:27,746 --> 01:11:29,186
"List of criminals?"

963
01:11:30,266 --> 01:11:43,886
"Yes. It's a book. We keep photographs of all the people who've been to prison. It also has the fingerprints of thieves that we're trying to catch. Perhaps your thief is one of the men that we're looking for."

964
01:11:43,966 --> 01:11:45,786
The telephone rang.

965
01:11:45,847 --> 01:11:48,626
"Just a minute," the chief said.

966
01:11:48,686 --> 01:11:49,766
He spoke into the telephone.

967
01:11:50,847 --> 01:11:53,146
"Yes. Come up to my office."

968
01:11:54,485 --> 01:11:55,505
He turned to Emil.

969
01:11:56,646 --> 01:12:00,905
"A few people are coming up to see you. They're reporters from the newspapers."

970
01:12:02,225 --> 01:12:05,466
"Oh. Are they going to write about me in the newspapers?"

971
01:12:06,506 --> 01:12:08,345
"I think so." The chief smiled.

972
01:12:08,926 --> 01:12:12,245
"When a schoolboy catches a thief, he becomes famous."

973
01:12:13,905 --> 01:12:16,965
The door opened and four reporters came into the room.

974
01:12:17,846 --> 01:12:22,265
The chief detective shook hands with them and told the story of Emil and the thief.

975
01:12:23,166 --> 01:12:25,725
The four reporters wrote everything down carefully.

976
01:12:27,085 --> 01:12:30,425
"This is a wonderful story," one of the reporters said.

977
01:12:30,825 --> 01:12:33,666
"A boy from the country becomes a detective!"

978
01:12:34,825 --> 01:12:37,265
"He should join the police," said another man.

979
01:12:38,686 --> 01:12:43,805
"Why didn't you go to the police at the beginning and tell them everything?" asked a third reporter.

980
01:12:44,846 --> 01:12:46,885
Emil suddenly felt afraid.

981
01:12:48,265 --> 01:12:51,525
"Yes, why didn't you do that?" asked the chief detective.

982
01:12:52,526 --> 01:13:03,386
"Because," Emil began slowly, "I painted a red nose on the statue in the station square at Newton. Do... Do I have to go to prison?"

983
01:13:04,445 --> 01:13:07,085
The reporters and the chief detective all laughed.

984
01:13:07,945 --> 01:13:10,345
"Of course not, Emil," said the chief.

985
01:13:10,846 --> 01:13:13,445
"We aren't going to send one of our best detectives to prison."

986
01:13:15,105 --> 01:13:18,565
"Oh, I'm very happy about that," Emil said.

987
01:13:19,805 --> 01:13:22,305
He turned to one of the reporters.

988
01:13:22,365 --> 01:13:24,465
"Don't you remember me?" he asked.

989
01:13:25,206 --> 01:13:30,166
"We were on the same tram yesterday. You paid for my ticket because I had no money."

990
01:13:31,505 --> 01:13:33,545
"Of course," said the reporter.

991
01:13:34,045 --> 01:13:38,445
"And you asked me where I lived. You wanted to come and give me back the money."

992
01:13:39,605 --> 01:13:44,185
"Can I give it to you now?" said Emil, taking some money out of his pocket.

993
01:13:44,245 --> 01:13:47,405
"Of course not," said the reporter.

994
01:13:47,465 --> 01:13:56,964
"I've got a better idea. Come with me and I'll show you the offices of our newspaper. But first we'll go and have some tea and cakes."

995
01:13:58,484 --> 01:14:00,984
"I'd like to go with you very much," said Emil.

996
01:14:01,605 --> 01:14:04,144
"But Paul and the Captain are waiting for me outside."

997
01:14:05,244 --> 01:14:07,824
"Then they must come too," said the reporter.

998
01:14:09,104 --> 01:14:10,804
But they had to wait a few more minutes.

999
01:14:11,524 --> 01:14:14,024
The other reporters wanted to ask some more questions.

1000
01:14:15,104 --> 01:14:17,684
Emil told them everything that they wanted to know.

1001
01:14:18,264 --> 01:14:19,625
They wrote it all down.

1002
01:14:21,225 --> 01:14:26,625
"Is this the first time that Mr Green has stolen anything?" one of them asked the chief detective.

1003
01:14:27,764 --> 01:14:29,564
"I don't think so," he replied.

1004
01:14:30,125 --> 01:14:34,364
"Phone me in an hour. It's possible that I'll have a big surprise for you."

1005
01:14:36,924 --> 01:14:36,924
***

1006
01:14:36,944 --> 01:14:44,305
The reporter from the tram put Emil, Paul and the Captain into a taxi, and they all drove away for tea and cakes.

1007
01:14:44,924 --> 01:14:46,724
Paul sounded his horn on the way.

1008
01:14:47,744 --> 01:14:54,004
In the cafe, the boys ate a lot of cakes and told the reporter about their exciting adventure.

1009
01:14:55,084 --> 01:14:58,924
They told him about the meeting in the square and how they followed the taxi.

1010
01:14:59,985 --> 01:15:04,424
They told him how Paul dressed as a lift boy, and about the fight in the bank.

1011
01:15:05,985 --> 01:15:11,104
"You are three of the finest boys that I've ever met," the reporter said at the end.

1012
01:15:12,025 --> 01:15:14,424
They all felt very proud of themselves.

1013
01:15:17,824 --> 01:15:17,824
***

1014
01:15:17,924 --> 01:15:21,244
After tea, the reporter took Emil to the newspaper office.

1015
01:15:21,845 --> 01:15:23,644
It was a very large building.

1016
01:15:24,444 --> 01:15:27,485
People were running in and out of rooms all the time.

1017
01:15:28,504 --> 01:15:30,125
Everyone seemed very busy.

1018
01:15:30,904 --> 01:15:35,004
The place was filled with the sound of people typing.

1019
01:15:35,064 --> 01:15:38,384
They went into a room where a young lady was sitting.

1020
01:15:38,805 --> 01:15:43,044
The reporter walked up and down, telling her Emil's story.

1021
01:15:43,104 --> 01:15:45,884
Emil watched as she typed it all.

1022
01:15:45,944 --> 01:15:49,084
Then the reporter telephoned the chief detective's office.

1023
01:15:49,985 --> 01:15:52,485
He listened for some time.

1024
01:15:52,544 --> 01:15:56,503
"Really? Is that true?" Emil heard him say.

1025
01:15:57,643 --> 01:16:04,163
"You don't want me to tell him? Thank you very much. It will be a wonderful story for the newspaper."

1026
01:16:05,683 --> 01:16:11,663
The reporter turned to Emil and said: "Come with me, quickly. We must take your photograph."

1027
01:16:12,764 --> 01:16:14,983
"Why?" asked Emil in surprise.

1028
01:16:15,703 --> 01:16:16,743
The reporter smiled.

1029
01:16:17,963 --> 01:16:20,543
They went up in the lift and into a large room.

1030
01:16:21,483 --> 01:16:24,703
Emil tidied his hair and someone took his photograph.

1031
01:16:25,663 --> 01:16:28,163
Then the reporter took Emil down to the street.

1032
01:16:28,924 --> 01:16:30,823
He called a taxi to take Emil home.

1033
01:16:32,003 --> 01:16:34,104
"Goodbye," the reporter said.

1034
01:16:34,903 --> 01:16:40,823
"And don't forget to read the newspaper this afternoon. I think you'll be very surprised."

1035
01:16:44,823 --> 01:16:45,523
CHAPTER EIGHT

1036
01:16:46,343 --> 01:16:47,883
With Grandmother at Last!

1037
01:16:49,924 --> 01:16:53,943
On the way to Bridge Street, Emil asked the driver to stop at the cafe.

1038
01:16:54,623 --> 01:16:56,683
His case and the flowers were still there.

1039
01:16:57,523 --> 01:17:01,683
He took them, thanked the owner of the cafe and got back into the taxi.

1040
01:17:02,963 --> 01:17:05,563
At last they arrived at his grandmother's house.

1041
01:17:06,624 --> 01:17:07,764
Emil rang the bell.

1042
01:17:08,403 --> 01:17:11,944
The door opened and his grandmother was standing in front of him.

1043
01:17:12,923 --> 01:17:21,883
She kissed him, pulled his hair and said: "Emil, you wild boy! We've heard some very strange stories about you!"

1044
01:17:23,084 --> 01:17:25,584
Polly and her mother came running from the kitchen.

1045
01:17:26,223 --> 01:17:27,783
They both looked very pleased.

1046
01:17:28,703 --> 01:17:30,903
"Did you get the money back?" Polly asked.

1047
01:17:31,584 --> 01:17:33,484
"Of course," Emil answered.

1048
01:17:34,283 --> 01:17:38,503
He took the notes from his pocket and gave his grandmother sixty pounds.

1049
01:17:39,823 --> 01:17:41,944
"Here's the money, Grandmother," he said.

1050
01:17:42,423 --> 01:17:52,484
"It comes with Mother's love. She's sorry that she couldn't send any for the last three months. But business wasn't very good. Now she's sent you more than usual."

1051
01:17:53,844 --> 01:17:57,323
"Thank you very much, my child," the old woman answered.

1052
01:17:58,464 --> 01:18:05,323
She gave him back one of the pound notes and said: "That's for you, because you're an excellent detective."

1053
01:18:06,623 --> 01:18:07,944
Emil thanked his grandmother.

1054
01:18:08,943 --> 01:18:10,763
Then he gave the flowers to his aunt.

1055
01:18:11,603 --> 01:18:15,683
She took the paper off them, and Polly brought a pot of water from the kitchen.

1056
01:18:16,484 --> 01:18:17,483
But it was too late.

1057
01:18:18,063 --> 01:18:19,143
The flowers were dead.

1058
01:18:20,504 --> 01:18:24,283
"Oh dear. They look like dry grass," said Polly.

1059
01:18:25,443 --> 01:18:28,883
"They were fresh when Mother gave them to me," Emil said sadly.

1060
01:18:29,583 --> 01:18:31,463
"But I couldn't give them any water yesterday."

1061
01:18:32,684 --> 01:18:35,164
"It doesn't matter," his grandmother said.

1062
01:18:35,743 --> 01:18:42,403
"Now we must have our dinner. Uncle won't be home before this evening. Can you help me please, Polly?"

1063
01:18:45,463 --> 01:18:45,463
***

1064
01:18:45,563 --> 01:18:52,303
After dinner, Emil wanted to ride Polly's shining new bicycle, so he and Polly went out into the street.

1065
01:18:53,203 --> 01:18:55,403
His grandmother lay down to rest.

1066
01:18:55,463 --> 01:18:57,223
His aunt made an apple cake.

1067
01:18:57,984 --> 01:18:59,763
Her apple cakes were famous.

1068
01:19:01,083 --> 01:19:05,123
As Emil was riding along Bridge Street, a policeman came past.

1069
01:19:06,283 --> 01:19:09,123
"Do you know where Number 15 is?" he asked.

1070
01:19:10,064 --> 01:19:14,183
"Yes. Why? Has something happened?" Emil replied.

1071
01:19:14,863 --> 01:19:16,663
He was thinking about the statue again.

1072
01:19:17,723 --> 01:19:19,943
"No, no," said the policeman.

1073
01:19:20,763 --> 01:19:23,943
"Are you the schoolboy Emil Fisher?"

1074
01:19:24,024 --> 01:19:25,703
"Yes, sir."

1075
01:19:25,783 --> 01:19:28,123
The policeman didn't say another word.

1076
01:19:28,183 --> 01:19:30,643
He just walked to the house and rang the bell.

1077
01:19:32,583 --> 01:19:32,583
***

1078
01:19:32,683 --> 01:19:35,783
Emil's aunt asked the policeman to sit down in the sitting-room.

1079
01:19:36,484 --> 01:19:38,204
His grandmother woke up.

1080
01:19:38,303 --> 01:19:40,403
She wanted to know what was happening, too.

1081
01:19:41,704 --> 01:19:44,343
Emil and Polly stood near the table.

1082
01:19:44,403 --> 01:19:47,503
They were all excited.

1083
01:19:47,563 --> 01:19:50,283
"I have some news for you," the policeman began.

1084
01:19:51,123 --> 01:20:15,702
"Emil and his detectives followed a bank thief. The police have wanted to catch the man for a long time. We found his fingerprints in our list of criminals, so he had to tell us everything. And this time his story was true. Most of the money that he stole was in his hat and inside his coat. It was all in hundred-pound notes."

1085
01:20:16,723 --> 01:20:18,642
"Really?" said Polly.

1086
01:20:19,202 --> 01:20:20,242
She couldn't believe it.

1087
01:20:21,282 --> 01:20:38,302
The policeman continued: "Two weeks ago, the bank promised a reward to the person who found the thief. And you caught the man," he said, turning to Emil, "so you'll receive the reward. The chief detective is very pleased."

1088
01:20:39,622 --> 01:20:43,482
The policeman took some notes from his pocket and put them on the table.

1089
01:20:44,383 --> 01:20:46,282
"Fifty pounds," he said.

1090
01:20:47,802 --> 01:20:49,662
Emil looked at the money.

1091
01:20:50,662 --> 01:20:52,402
He was too surprised to speak.

1092
01:20:53,842 --> 01:20:57,582
His grandmother gave the policeman a cup of coffee and then he left.

1093
01:20:58,643 --> 01:21:06,902
The old woman put her arm round Emil, saying: "I can't believe it! I can't believe it!"

1094
01:21:06,982 --> 01:21:09,722
Emil still couldn't speak, but Polly could.

1095
01:21:10,222 --> 01:21:15,142
She jumped up and down, shouting: "Now we can invite all the boys here to tea."

1096
01:21:16,442 --> 01:21:17,602
"Yes," Emil said.

1097
01:21:18,182 --> 01:21:20,522
"But first we must invite Mother."

1098
01:21:23,862 --> 01:21:24,662
CHAPTER NINE

1099
01:21:25,342 --> 01:21:28,942
Emil's Mother Goes to the City

1100
01:21:28,982 --> 01:21:33,642
The next morning, Mrs Fishers neighbour, Mrs Martin, rang her doorbell.

1101
01:21:34,822 --> 01:21:36,842
"How are you, Mrs Fisher?" she asked.

1102
01:21:38,062 --> 01:21:41,243
"I'm worried about my son," Mrs Fisher replied.

1103
01:21:41,762 --> 01:21:47,262
"He hasn't written to me since he went to the city. I'm watching for the postman all the time."

1104
01:21:48,662 --> 01:21:52,283
"Well now you can stop worrying, my dear," said Mrs Martin.

1105
01:21:52,843 --> 01:21:56,042
"I came to tell you that he's fine. He sends his love."

1106
01:21:57,183 --> 01:21:59,242
"Where is he? How do you know?"

1107
01:22:00,182 --> 01:22:11,043
"He's very well. He's also famous. He caught a thief and was given a reward of fifty pounds. You must go to the city on the next train."

1108
01:22:12,082 --> 01:22:13,703
"But who told you all this?"

1109
01:22:14,582 --> 01:22:18,622
"Your sister's just phoned me. You must go and see them immediately."

1110
01:22:19,563 --> 01:22:19,563
***

1111
01:22:21,002 --> 01:22:24,542
Later that afternoon, Mrs Fisher had another surprise.

1112
01:22:25,422 --> 01:22:29,783
She was sitting on the train and a man opposite her was reading a newspaper.

1113
01:22:30,783 --> 01:22:33,643
Suddenly she saw something on the front page.

1114
01:22:35,143 --> 01:22:40,062
"That's my son!" she cried, pointing to a photograph of Emil.

1115
01:22:41,283 --> 01:22:44,582
The man put down the newspaper and looked up in surprise.

1116
01:22:45,502 --> 01:22:46,902
"Really?" he said.

1117
01:22:47,422 --> 01:22:56,543
"So you're Emil Fisher's mother. I'm sure you're very proud of him. Here, you can read the story." And he gave her the newspaper.

1118
01:22:58,222 --> 01:23:07,022
"COUNTRY BOY ACTS AS DETECTIVE", she read. "100 CHILDREN FOLLOW A THIEF".

1119
01:23:07,102 --> 01:23:08,722
Then came Emil's story.

1120
01:23:09,783 --> 01:23:12,302
Mrs Fisher read every word carefully.

1121
01:23:13,283 --> 01:23:16,422
When she finished, she felt very proud of her son.

1122
01:23:17,162 --> 01:23:20,323
So she read the story again - seven times.

1123
01:23:21,982 --> 01:23:24,142
Emil was waiting for her at East Station.

1124
01:23:25,162 --> 01:23:27,562
"Isn't it wonderful?" he said.

1125
01:23:28,222 --> 01:23:35,342
"And do you know what I'm going to do? I'm going to buy a new coat for you, and a football for me."

1126
01:23:36,602 --> 01:23:37,522
His mother smiled.

1127
01:23:38,482 --> 01:23:48,842
"That's very nice of you, dear. But I've got a better idea. We'll put most of the money in the bank and save it. When you're older, it will be very useful to you."

1128
01:23:50,222 --> 01:23:53,361
"Well, OK," said Emil.

1129
01:23:54,021 --> 01:23:59,562
"But you'll still have your coat. And now I'd like you to meet my friends."

1130
01:24:00,501 --> 01:24:01,182
"Where are they?"

1131
01:24:02,022 --> 01:24:12,261
"At Grandmother's house. Aunt has made one of her apple cakes, and we've asked all the boys to a tea party. They're there now, making a lot of noise."

1132
01:24:15,021 --> 01:24:17,062
And it was noisy when they arrived.

1133
01:24:17,802 --> 01:24:28,741
All Emil's new friends were there: Paul, the Captain, Gerald, Walter, Robert, Tony, John, Little Tuesday and the others.

1134
01:24:29,342 --> 01:24:31,081
There weren't enough chairs for everyone.

1135
01:24:32,221 --> 01:24:36,482
Polly was running from one table to another with a big pot of tea.

1136
01:24:37,441 --> 01:24:39,181
Everyone was eating apple cake.

1137
01:24:39,921 --> 01:24:42,141
The old grandmother was laughing happily.

1138
01:24:43,361 --> 01:24:46,141
Emil's mother thanked the boys for helping her son.

1139
01:24:47,261 --> 01:24:49,661
Suddenly the old grandmother stood up.

1140
01:24:50,642 --> 01:24:53,761
"Now listen to me, boys," she began.

1141
01:24:54,761 --> 01:24:55,721
There was silence.

1142
01:24:57,041 --> 01:25:00,681
"I'm not going to tell you how wonderful you are," she said.

1143
01:25:01,101 --> 01:25:29,241
"It isn't a good idea to be too proud of yourselves. It's true that you caught a thief. But there's one boy here who wanted to follow Mr Green with the rest of you. He wanted to go after him in a taxi, and dress in a lift boy's clothes and watch him secretly. But he didn't. He did what you told him to do. He stayed at home by the telephone and helped in that way."

1144
01:25:30,621 --> 01:25:32,701
Everyone looked at Little Tuesday.

1145
01:25:33,821 --> 01:25:39,162
"Yes, I'm talking about Little Tuesday," the grandmother continued.

1146
01:25:39,221 --> 01:25:51,080
"He stayed by the telephone for two days. It was a boring job, but he did it well. Now let's all stand up and thank Little Tuesday."

1147
01:25:52,220 --> 01:25:54,780
And that is exactly what everyone did.

1148
01:25:58,080 --> 01:25:58,080
***

1149
01:25:58,101 --> 01:26:01,340
The party ended, and all the boys went home.

1150
01:26:02,320 --> 01:26:05,840
But first they promised to meet again before Emil went back to Newton.

1151
01:26:06,860 --> 01:26:09,400
The family sat and talked about Emil's adventure.

1152
01:26:11,341 --> 01:26:18,680
"Well," said Emil, "I've learnt one lesson. You can't believe everything that strangers tell you."

1153
01:26:20,101 --> 01:26:22,841
"And I've learnt something, too," said his mother.

1154
01:26:23,420 --> 01:26:26,380
"It's not a good idea for boys to travel alone."

1155
01:26:27,900 --> 01:26:29,740
Emil's grandmother didn't agree.

1156
01:26:30,541 --> 01:26:32,341
"You're wrong, dear," she said.

1157
01:26:32,721 --> 01:26:33,260
"You're wrong."

1158
01:26:34,701 --> 01:26:36,460
"Perhaps," said Emil's mother.

1159
01:26:37,060 --> 01:26:39,380
"But isn't there a lesson that we can learn from this?"

1160
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:41,800
The old lady smiled.

1161
01:26:42,640 --> 01:26:44,661
"Yes, there is," she said.

1162
01:26:45,521 --> 01:26:53,600
"Life is difficult sometimes, but there are many kind people in the world." She turned to Emil.

1163
01:26:53,661 --> 01:26:56,760
"And a true friend comes when you need help."
