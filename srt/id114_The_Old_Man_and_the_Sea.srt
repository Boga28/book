CHAPTER ONE
The Worst Kind of Mark

2
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:18,270
He was an old man who fished alone in a skiff
in the Gulf Stream and he had gone eighty-four

3
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:20,560
days now without catching a fish.

4
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:26,140
During the first forty days without a fish,
the boy's parents had told him that the old

5
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:31,369
man was now definitely and finally salao,
which is the worst form of unlucky.

6
00:00:31,369 --> 00:00:36,530
The boy's parents had ordered him to go in
another boat, which caught three good fish

7
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:38,190
the first week.

8
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:43,790
It made the boy sad to see the old man come
back each day with his skiff empty.

9
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:49,110
He always went down to help him carry the
lines, or the gaff and harpoon and the sail

10
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:54,510
patched with flour sacks, so that when it
was furled it looked like the flag of permanent

11
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:58,670
defeat.

12
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:04,300
The old man was thin and gaunt with deep wrinkles
on the back of his neck and deep scars on

13
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:08,299
his hands from handling lines of heavy fish.

14
00:01:08,299 --> 00:01:14,140
The dark spots of the benign skin cancer that
the tropical sun brings were on his cheeks.

15
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:18,140
His scars were as old as forgotten memories.

16
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:21,590
Everything about him was old except his eyes.

17
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:26,439
They were the same color as the sea and were
cheerful and undefeated.

18
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:31,340
"Santiago," the boy said to him, "I could
go with you again.

19
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:33,170
We've made some money."

20
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:37,350
The old man had taught the boy to fish and
the boy loved him.

21
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:39,640
"No," the old man said.

22
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,860
"You're with a lucky boat.

23
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:42,860
Stay there."

24
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:48,659
"But remember how you went eighty-seven days
without fish and then we caught big ones every

25
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:50,049
day for three weeks."

26
00:01:50,049 --> 00:01:55,700
"I remember," the old man said.

27
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:59,719
"I know you did not leave me because you doubted."

28
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:02,289
"It was papa who made me leave.

29
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:05,009
I am a boy and I must obey him."

30
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:07,950
"I know," the old man said.

31
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:10,090
"He hasn't much faith."

32
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:12,790
"No, but we have.

33
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:14,060
Haven't we?"

34
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:15,060
"Yes.

35
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:20,330
Can I offer you a beer on the Terrace and
then we'll take the stuff home."

36
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:21,570
"Why not?"

37
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:24,720
the old man said.

38
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,460
"Between fishermen."

39
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:38,000
They sat on the Terrace and many of the fishermen
made fun of the old man, but he was not angry.

40
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,890
The older fishermen looked at him and were
sad, but they did not show it.

41
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:47,810
The successful fishermen of that day had already
butchered their marlin and carried them to

42
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:52,230
the ice truck that would take them to the
market in Havana.

43
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:56,480
Those who had caught sharks had taken them
to the shark factory on the other side of

44
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,100
the cove.

45
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:03,150
When the wind came from the east a smell came
from the shark factory.

46
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:06,150
"Santiago," the boy said.

47
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:08,970
"Yes," the old man said.

48
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:11,000
He was thinking of many years ago.

49
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,320
"Can I go out and get sardines for you for
tomorrow?"

50
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,460
"No.

51
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:18,550
Go and play baseball.

52
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:22,170
I can still row and Rogelio will throw the
net."

53
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:24,200
"I would like to go.

54
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,650
If I cannot fish with you, I would like to
serve in some way."

55
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:30,100
"You bought me a beer."

56
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,190
the old man said.

57
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:32,950
"You are already a man."

58
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:37,820
"How old was I when you first took me in a
boat?"

59
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:43,380
"Five and you were nearly killed when I brought
the fish in too green and it nearly destroyed

60
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:44,380
the boat.

61
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:45,830
Can you remember?"

62
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:49,730
"I can remember the tail slapping and the
noise of the clubbing."

63
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:52,520
"Can you really remember that?"

64
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:56,680
"I remember everything from when we went together."

65
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:00,170
The old man looked at him with his confident,
loving eyes.

66
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:04,580
"If you were my boy I'd take you out," he
said.

67
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:09,970
"But you are your father's and your mother's
and you are in a lucky boat."

68
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:12,400
"May I get the sardines?

69
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,100
I know where I can get four baits too."

70
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,280
"I have mine left from today."

71
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,209
"Let me get four fresh ones."

72
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:23,030
"One," the old man said.

73
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:26,090
His hope and his confidence had never left
him.

74
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:27,090
"Two."

75
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:28,550
the boy said.

76
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:30,880
"Two," the old man agreed.

77
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,870
"Yon didn't steal them?"

78
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:34,939
"I would," the boy said.

79
00:04:34,939 --> 00:04:36,740
"But I bought these."

80
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:39,490
"Thank you," the old man said.

81
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:43,710
"Tomorrow is going to be a good day with this
current."

82
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:47,629
He was too simple to wonder when he had attained
humility.

83
00:04:47,629 --> 00:04:49,949
But he knew it carried no loss of pride.

84
00:04:49,949 --> 00:04:52,250
"Where are you going?"

85
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,250
the boy asked.

86
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,499
"Far out.

87
00:04:54,499 --> 00:04:57,219
I want to be out before it is light."

88
00:04:57,219 --> 00:05:00,919
"Are you strong enough now for a truly big
fish?"

89
00:05:00,919 --> 00:05:02,759
"I think so.

90
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:04,560
And there are many tricks."

91
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:11,330
"Let us take the stuff home," the boy said,
"so I can get the cast net and go after the

92
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:12,530
sardines."

93
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:15,080
They picked up the things from the boat.

94
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:19,770
The old man carried the mast on his shoulder
and the boy carried the wooden box with the

95
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:21,560
fishing gear.

96
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:25,740
They walked to the old man's shack and went
in through its open door.

97
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:31,060
The shack was made of the tough part of the
royal palm called guano.

98
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:36,789
In the shack there was a bed, a table, one
chair and a place on the dirt floor to cook

99
00:05:36,789 --> 00:05:39,099
with charcoal.

100
00:05:39,099 --> 00:05:44,520
On the brown walls there was a color picture
of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and another of

101
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:49,780
the Virgin of Cobre, both relics of his wife.

102
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:54,190
Once there had been a photograph of his wife
on the wall but he had taken it down because

103
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:56,169
it had made him lonely.

104
00:05:56,169 --> 00:05:59,990
Now it was on the shelf in the corner under
his clean shirt.

105
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:02,259
"What do you have to eat?"

106
00:06:02,259 --> 00:06:03,360
the boy asked.

107
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,189
"A pot of yellow rice with fish.

108
00:06:06,189 --> 00:06:07,509
Do you want some?"

109
00:06:07,509 --> 00:06:08,509
"No.

110
00:06:08,509 --> 00:06:09,819
I will eat at home.

111
00:06:09,819 --> 00:06:11,990
Do you want me to make a fire?"

112
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:12,990
"No.

113
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:14,340
I will make it later on."

114
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:17,099
"May I take the cast net?"

115
00:06:17,099 --> 00:06:19,180
"Of course."

116
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:23,310
There was no cast net and the boy remembered
when they had sold it.

117
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:26,360
But they went through this fiction every day.

118
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:31,680
There was no pot of yellow rice and fish and
the boy knew this too.

119
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,030
"Eighty-five is a kicky number," the old man
said.

120
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:41,300
"How would you like to see me bring one in
that weighed over a thousand pounds?"

121
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:44,990
"I'll get the cast net and go for sardines.

122
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:47,289
Will you sit in the sun in the doorway?"

123
00:06:47,289 --> 00:06:48,370
"Yes.

124
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:53,180
I have yesterday's paper and I will read about
baseball."

125
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:57,389
The boy did not know whether yesterday's paper
was fiction too.

126
00:06:57,389 --> 00:07:00,129
But the old man brought it out from under
the bed.

127
00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:05,439
"Perico gave it to me at the bodega." he explained.

128
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:09,069
"I'll be back when I have the sardines.

129
00:07:09,069 --> 00:07:13,779
I'll keep yours and mine together on ice and
we can share them in the morning.

130
00:07:13,779 --> 00:07:16,740
When I come back you can tell me about baseball.

131
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,900
Now keep warm, old man.

132
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,789
Remember we are in September," the boy said.

133
00:07:21,789 --> 00:07:26,319
"The month when the great fish come," the
old man said.

134
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,809
"Anyone can be a fisherman in May."

135
00:07:29,809 --> 00:07:34,129
'I'm going for the sardines now," the boy
said.

136
00:07:34,129 --> 00:07:39,060
When the boy came back the old man was asleep
in the chair and the sun was down.

137
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:43,979
The boy took the old army blanket off the
bed and spread it over the back of the chair

138
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:47,999
and over the old mail's strange but powerful
shoulders.

139
00:07:47,999 --> 00:07:52,320
His shirt had been patched so many times that
it was like a sail.

140
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:58,550
The old man's head was very old and with his
eyes closed there was no life in his face.

141
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:00,509
He was barefoot.

142
00:08:00,509 --> 00:08:05,080
The boy left him there and when he came back
the old man was still asleep.

143
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:09,590
"Wake up, old man," the boy said.

144
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:15,589
The old man opened his eyes and for a moment
he was coming back from a long way away.

145
00:08:15,589 --> 00:08:16,589
Then he smiled.

146
00:08:16,589 --> 00:08:19,650
"What have you got?" he asked.

147
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:21,360
"Supper," said the boy.

148
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,729
"We're going to have supper."

149
00:08:22,729 --> 00:08:24,750
"I'm not very hungry-"

150
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,999
"Come on and eat.

151
00:08:26,999 --> 00:08:28,789
You can't fish and not eat."

152
00:08:28,789 --> 00:08:30,669
"What are we eating?"

153
00:08:30,669 --> 00:08:35,860
"Black beans and rice, fried bananas and some
stow."

154
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:39,180
The boy had brought them in a metal container
from the Terrace.

155
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:42,740
"That's very kind of you," the old man said.

156
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:44,450
"Should we eat?"

157
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:47,889
"I've been asking you to," the boy told him
gently.

158
00:08:47,889 --> 00:08:50,931
"I didn't want to open the container until
you were ready."

159
00:08:50,931 --> 00:08:54,440
"I'm ready now," the old man said.

160
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,810
"I only needed time to wash."

161
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:59,560
Where did he wash?

162
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,490
the boy thought.

163
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:05,269
The village water supply was two streets down
the road.

164
00:09:05,269 --> 00:09:08,830
I must have water here for him, and soap and
a towel.

165
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:10,830
Why am I so thoughtless?

166
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:16,410
I must got him another shirt and a jacket
for the winter and some sort of shoes and

167
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:17,970
another blanket.

168
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:21,800
"Your stew is excellent," the old man said.

169
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:25,660
"Tell me about baseball," the boy asked him.

170
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:31,639
"In the American League it is the Yankees
as I said," the old man said happily.

171
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:34,779
"They lost today," the boy told him.

172
00:09:34,779 --> 00:09:36,889
"That means nothing.

173
00:09:36,889 --> 00:09:39,790
The great DiMaggio is himself again."

174
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:43,079
"They have other men on the team."

175
00:09:43,079 --> 00:09:44,079
"Naturally.

176
00:09:44,079 --> 00:09:47,070
But he makes the difference," the old man
said.

177
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:51,160
"Do you remember when he used to come to the
Terrace?

178
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:55,330
I wanted to take him fishing but I was too
timid to ask him.

179
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:59,570
Then I asked you to ask him and you were too
timid.

180
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:03,519
I would like to take the great DiMaggio fishing.

181
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,600
They say his father was a fisherman.

182
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,600
Maybe he was as poor as we are and would understand."

183
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:16,920
"I used to sail on a big ship that went to
Africa and I have seen lions on the beaches

184
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:17,920
in the evening."

185
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,440
"I know.

186
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,440
You told me."

187
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:25,990
"Should we talk about Africa or about baseball?"

188
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:27,399
"Baseball.

189
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:31,230
Tell me about the great John Jota McGraw,"
the boy said.

190
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:35,870
"He used to come to the Terrace sometimes
in the older days.

191
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:39,910
But he was rough and harsh-spoken when he
drank too much."

192
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:44,779
"Who is the greatest manager, really, Luque
or Mike Gonzalez?"

193
00:10:44,779 --> 00:10:46,190
"I think they are equal."

194
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:48,440
"And the best fisherman is you."

195
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,140
"No.

196
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:52,680
I know others that are better."

197
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:59,110
"Que va," the boy said, "There are many good
fishermen and some great ones, but there is

198
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:00,610
only you."

199
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:02,110
"Thank you.

200
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:03,519
You make me happy.

201
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:08,160
I hope no fish will come along so great that
he will prove us wrong."

202
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:13,170
"There is no such fish if you are still strong
as you say."

203
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:17,750
"I may not be as strong as I think," the old
man said.

204
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:21,480
"But I know many tricks and I have resolution."

205
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:26,009
"You ought to go to bed now so that you will
be fresh in the morning."

206
00:11:26,009 --> 00:11:28,110
"Good night then.

207
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:30,310
I will wake you in the morning."

208
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:33,380
"You're my alarm clock," the boy said.

209
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:37,050
"Age is my alarm clock," the old man said.

210
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:40,170
"Why do old men wake so early?

211
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:42,089
Is it to have longer days?"

212
00:11:42,089 --> 00:11:44,930
"I don't know," the boy said.

213
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:49,240
"All I know is that young boys sleep late
and hard.

214
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,800
Sleep well, old man."

215
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,149
They had eaten with no light on the table.

216
00:11:54,149 --> 00:12:00,089
The old man rolled his trousers up to make
a pillow, putting the newspaper inside them.

217
00:12:00,089 --> 00:12:05,200
He rolled himself in the blanket and slept
on the other old newspapers that covered the

218
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:16,690
springs of the bed.

219
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:24,879
CHAPTER TWO
Far Out to Sea

220
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:30,399
The old man dreamed of Africa when he was
a boy and the long, golden beaches.

221
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:36,069
He lived along that coast now every night
and in his dreams he heard the surf roar and

222
00:12:36,069 --> 00:12:39,279
saw the native boats come riding through it.

223
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:45,949
As he slept he smelled the smell of Africa
that the land breeze brought in the morning.

224
00:12:45,949 --> 00:12:52,360
He no longer dreamed of storms, nor of women,
nor of great events, nor of great fish, nor

225
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:57,810
of fights, nor of contests of strength, nor
of his wife.

226
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:02,260
Now he only dreamed of places and of the lions
on the beach.

227
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:07,440
They played like young cats in the dusk and
he loved their, as he loved the boy.

228
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,540
He never dreamed about the boy.

229
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:16,079
He woke up, looked out the open door at the
moon and unrolled his trousers and put them

230
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:17,079
on.

231
00:13:17,079 --> 00:13:19,350
He went up the road to wake the boy.

232
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:24,300
The door of the house where the boy lived
was unlocked and the old man opened it and

233
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,220
walked in quietly.

234
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:31,550
He took hold of the boy's foot gently and
held it until the boy woke and turned and

235
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:33,259
looked at him.

236
00:13:33,259 --> 00:13:39,009
The old man nodded and the boy took his trousers
from the chair by the bed and, sitting on

237
00:13:39,009 --> 00:13:41,810
the bed, pulled them on.

238
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:45,629
The old man went out the door and the boy
came after him.

239
00:13:45,629 --> 00:13:50,079
He was sleepy and the old man put his arm
across his shoulders and said.

240
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,899
"I am sorry."

241
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:54,019
"Que va," the boy said.

242
00:13:54,019 --> 00:13:58,310
"It is what a man must do."

243
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:03,509
They walked down the road to the old man's
shack and all along the road, in the dark,

244
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:07,899
barefoot men were moving, carrying the masts
of their boats.

245
00:14:07,899 --> 00:14:12,439
When they reached the old man's shack the
boy took the rolls of lute in the basket,

246
00:14:12,439 --> 00:14:18,279
the harpoon and gaff, and the old man carried
the mast with the furled sail on his shoulder.

247
00:14:18,279 --> 00:14:20,480
"Do you want coffee?"

248
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,480
the boy asked.

249
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:25,759
"We'll put the gear in the boat and then get
some."

250
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:31,769
They had coffee from condensed-milk cans at
an early morning place that served fishermen.

251
00:14:31,769 --> 00:14:34,480
"How did you sleep, old man?"

252
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,920
the boy asked.

253
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:40,880
He was waking up now although it was still
hard for him to leave his sleep.

254
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,959
"Very well, Manolin," the old man said.

255
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:46,850
"I feel confident today."

256
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:49,819
"So do I." the boy said.

257
00:14:49,819 --> 00:14:53,920
"Now I must get your sardines and mine and
your fresh baits."

258
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,379
"I'll be right back."

259
00:14:56,379 --> 00:14:57,389
the boy said.

260
00:14:57,389 --> 00:14:58,920
"Have another coffee.

261
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,560
We have credit here."

262
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,189
The old man drank his coffee slowly.

263
00:15:03,189 --> 00:15:08,149
It was all he would have all day and he knew
that he should drink it.

264
00:15:08,149 --> 00:15:13,100
For a long time now eating had bored him and
he never carried a lunch.

265
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:19,040
He had a bottle of water in the bow of the
skiff and that was all he needed for the day.

266
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:25,060
The boy was back now with the sardines and
the two baits, and they went down to the skiff,

267
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:27,579
feeling the pebbled sand under their feet.

268
00:15:27,579 --> 00:15:30,269
They lifted the skiff and slid her into the
water.

269
00:15:30,269 --> 00:15:32,410
"Good luck, old man."

270
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:37,430
"Good luck," the old man said.

271
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:43,029
He fitted the rope lashings of the oars onto
the thole pins and, leaning forward, he began

272
00:15:43,029 --> 00:15:46,089
to row out of the harbor in the dark.

273
00:15:46,089 --> 00:15:50,800
There were other boats going out to sea and
the old man heard the dip and push of their

274
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,709
oars even though he could not see them.

275
00:15:54,709 --> 00:16:00,339
The old man knew he was going far out and
he left the smell of the laud behind and rowed

276
00:16:00,339 --> 00:16:06,649
out into the clean early morning smell of
the ocean.

277
00:16:06,649 --> 00:16:11,430
In the dark the old man could feel the morning
coming and as he rowed he heard the sound

278
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:14,339
of flying fish leaving the water.

279
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:19,880
He was very fond of flying fish as they were
his principal friends on the ocean.

280
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:25,040
He was sorry for the birds, especially the
small delicate dark terns that were always

281
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,779
flying and looking and almost never finding.

282
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:34,189
And he thought, the birds have a harder life
than we do except for the robber birds and

283
00:16:34,189 --> 00:16:35,470
the heavy strong ones.

284
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:41,269
Why did they make birds so delicate and fine
as those sea swallows when the ocean can be

285
00:16:41,269 --> 00:16:42,269
so cruel?

286
00:16:42,269 --> 00:16:44,939
She is kind and very beautiful.

287
00:16:44,939 --> 00:16:47,920
But she can be so cruel.

288
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:53,029
He always thought of the sea as la mar which
is what people call her in Spanish when they

289
00:16:53,029 --> 00:16:55,139
love her.

290
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:59,839
Sometimes those who love her say bad things
about her but they always speak of the sea

291
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:01,930
as though she were a woman.

292
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:08,250
Some of the younger fishermen, who had motorboats,
speak of her as el mar which is masculine.

293
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:14,240
They speak of her as a contestant or a place
or even as an enemy.

294
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:20,069
But the old man always thought of her as feminine
and as something that gave or withheld great

295
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:26,350
favors, and if She did wild or wicked things
it was because she could not help them.

296
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:33,011
The moon affects her as it does a woman, he
thought.

297
00:17:33,011 --> 00:17:36,300
He was rowing steadily and it was no effort
for him.

298
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:42,440
"Today I'll row out where the schools of albacore
are and maybe there will be a big one with

299
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,130
them."

300
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:49,120
Before it was really light he had his four
baits out at different depths and he was drifting

301
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,570
with the current.

302
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:55,210
There was no part of the hook that a great
fish could feel which was not sweet-smelling

303
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:57,679
and good-tasting.

304
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:03,460
The boy had given him two small fresh tunas
which hung on the two deepest lines and on

305
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:07,920
the others, he had a big blue runner and a
yellow jack.

306
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:14,169
Each line was as thick as a big pencil and
was looped onto a stick so that any pull or

307
00:18:14,169 --> 00:18:17,169
touch on the bait would make the stick dip.

308
00:18:17,169 --> 00:18:23,070
Now the old man rowed gently to keep the lines
straight and at their proper depths.

309
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:28,760
The sun rose thinly from the sea and the old
man could see the other boats, low on the

310
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,780
water and well in toward the shore.

311
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:36,100
He looked down into the water and watched
the lines that went straight down into the

312
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,860
dark water.

313
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:41,250
He kept them straighter titan any other fisherman.

314
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:44,940
I keep them with precision, he thought.

315
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:47,820
Only I have no luck anymore.

316
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,140
But who knows?

317
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:50,630
Maybe today.

318
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:51,700
Every day is a new day.

319
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:54,250
It is better to be lucky.

320
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:56,980
But I would rather be exact.

321
00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:01,100
Then when luck comes you are ready.

322
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:06,570
Just then he saw a man-of-war bird with his
long black wings circling in the sky ahead

323
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:07,740
of him.

324
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:10,860
He made a quick drop and then circled again.

325
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:14,180
"He's got something," the old man said aloud.

326
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:16,020
"He's not just looking."

327
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:20,540
"Dolphin," the old man said aloud.

328
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:21,540
"Big dolphin."

329
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:29,390
As the old man watched, a small tuna rose
in the air, turned and dropped into the water.

330
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:33,909
Another and another rose and they were leaping
in long jumps alter the bait.

331
00:19:33,909 --> 00:19:38,760
After a while the stern line became taut under
his foot.

332
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:43,520
He dropped his oars and felt the weight of
the small tuna's shivering pull.

333
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:47,130
He could see the fish in the water as he pulled
it in.

334
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:52,700
The old man hit him on the head for kindness
and kicked him under the stern.

335
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:55,650
"Albacore," he said aloud.

336
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:59,090
"He'll make a beautiful bait."

337
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:03,760
He did not remember when he first started
talking to himself.

338
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:07,970
Probably when the boy had left him, but he
did not remember.

339
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:13,679
The sun was hot now and the old man felt it
on the back of his neck, and felt the sweat

340
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,899
trickle down his back as he rowed.

341
00:20:16,899 --> 00:20:22,600
Just then, watching his lines, he saw one
of the projecting green sticks dip sharply.

342
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,960
"Yes." he said.

343
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:29,090
"Yes," and he moved his oars inside the boat.

344
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:34,390
He reached out for the line and held it delicately
between the thumb and forefinger of his right

345
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:35,790
hand.

346
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:37,399
Then it came again.

347
00:20:37,399 --> 00:20:42,360
This time it was a tentative pull and he knew
exactly what it was.

348
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:47,630
One hundred fathoms below a marlin was eating
the sardines that covered the point of the

349
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:49,000
hook.

350
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,510
This far out, he must be huge, he thought.

351
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:54,110
Eat them, fish.

352
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:55,710
Please eat them.

353
00:20:55,710 --> 00:21:00,679
He felt the light delicate pull and then a
harder pull when a sardine's head must have

354
00:21:00,679 --> 00:21:04,830
been more difficult to break from the hook.

355
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,280
Then there was nothing.

356
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:10,040
"Come on," the old man said aloud.

357
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:12,060
"Just smell them.

358
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:14,090
Aren't they lovely?

359
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:17,419
Eat them now and then there is the tuna.

360
00:21:17,419 --> 00:21:19,410
Don't be shy, fish.

361
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:21,340
Eat them."

362
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:24,910
Then he felt something hard and unbelievably
heavy.

363
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:30,440
It was the weight of the fish and he let the
line slip down, down, down.

364
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,110
Now he was ready.

365
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:37,870
He had three forty-fathom coils of line in
reserve, as well as the coil he was using.

366
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:41,110
"Eat it a little more." he said.

367
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:43,419
"Eat it well."

368
00:21:43,419 --> 00:21:48,690
Eat it so that the point of the hook goes
into your heart and kills you, he thought.

369
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:51,970
Come up easy and let me put the harpoon into
you.

370
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:52,970
Are you ready?

371
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:55,960
Have you been at the table long enough?

372
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:02,750
"Now!" he said aloud and struck hard with
both hands, gained a yard of line and then

373
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:08,130
struck again and again, swinging with all
the strength of his arms and the weight of

374
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:09,600
his body.

375
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,240
Nothing happened.

376
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:16,919
The fish just moved away slowly and the old
man could not raise him an inch.

377
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:20,679
The boat began to move slowly toward the northwest.

378
00:22:20,679 --> 00:22:25,610
The fish moved steadily and they traveled
slowly on the calm water.

379
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:30,399
"I wish I had the boy," the old man said aloud.

380
00:22:30,399 --> 00:22:33,460
"I'm being towed by a fish.

381
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:37,950
I must hold him all I can and give him the
line when he wants it.

382
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:42,520
Thank God he is traveling and not going down."

383
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:48,770
Four hours later the fish was still swimming
out to sea, towing the skiff, and the old

384
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:56,789
man was still braced solidly with the line
across his back.

385
00:22:56,789 --> 00:23:06,149
CHAPTER THREE
The Battle Begins

386
00:23:06,149 --> 00:23:09,780
He looked behind him and saw that no land
was visible.

387
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:12,640
That makes no difference, he thought.

388
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,270
I can always come in on the glow from Havana.

389
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:19,700
Maybe he will come up before sunset, or with
the moon.

390
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:22,760
I have no cramps and I feel strong.

391
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:25,640
It is he that has the hook in his mouth.

392
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:28,100
But what a fish to pull like that.

393
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:33,830
I wish I could see him only once to know what
I have against me.

394
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:36,470
The fish never changed his course.

395
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:41,809
It was cold after the sun went down, he tied
the sack that covered the bait box around

396
00:23:41,809 --> 00:23:47,690
his neck so that it hung down over his back
and he cautiously worked it down under the

397
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:51,500
line that was across his shoulders now.

398
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:56,500
I can do nothing with him and he can do nothing
with me, he thought.

399
00:23:56,500 --> 00:24:01,440
Once he stood up and urinated over the side
of the skiff and looked at the stars and checked

400
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,970
his course.

401
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:08,480
They were moving more slowly now and the glow
of Havana was not so strong, so he knew the

402
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,990
current must be carrying them eastward.

403
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:16,730
I wonder how the baseball came out in the
grand leagues today, he thought.

404
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:19,769
It would be wonderful to do this with a radio.

405
00:24:19,769 --> 00:24:23,970
Think of what you are doing, you must do nothing
stupid.

406
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:28,149
Then he said aloud, "I wish I had the boy.

407
00:24:28,149 --> 00:24:31,710
To help me and to see this.'

408
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:35,429
No one should be alone in their old age, he
thought.

409
00:24:35,429 --> 00:24:37,419
But it is unavoidable.

410
00:24:37,419 --> 00:24:42,840
I must remember to eat the tuna before he
spoils in order to keep strong.

411
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:47,210
Remember, you must eat him in the morning,
he said to himself.

412
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:53,549
During the night two porpoise came around
the boat and he could hear them rolling and

413
00:24:53,549 --> 00:24:54,549
blowing.

414
00:24:54,549 --> 00:24:57,300
"They are good," he said.

415
00:24:57,300 --> 00:25:01,700
"They play and make jokes and love one another.

416
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:06,950
They are our brothers like the flying fish."

417
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:10,650
Then he began to pity the great fish that
he had hooked.

418
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:16,049
He is wonderful and strange and who knows
how old he is, he thought.

419
00:25:16,049 --> 00:25:20,760
Never have I had such a strong fish nor one
who acted so strangely.

420
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,600
Perhaps he is too wise to jump.

421
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,090
He could ruin me by jumping.

422
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:31,809
But what a great fish he is and what he will
bring in the market if the flesh is good,

423
00:25:31,809 --> 00:25:36,970
he took the bait like a male and he pulls
like a male and his fight has no panic in

424
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:37,970
it.

425
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:42,520
I wonder if he has any plans or if he is just
as desperate as I am.

426
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:49,750
"I wish the boy were here," he said aloud
and settled himself against the bow and felt

427
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:54,960
the strength of the great fish through the
line he held across his shoulders.

428
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:59,169
My choice was to go out to find him beyond
all people in the world.

429
00:25:59,169 --> 00:26:04,780
Now we are joined together and no one to help
either one of us.

430
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:10,320
The fish made a surge that pulled him down
on his face and made a cut below his eye.

431
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,279
The blood ran down his cheek a little way.

432
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:18,289
But it coagulated and dried before it reached
his chin and he worked his way back to the

433
00:26:18,289 --> 00:26:21,630
bow and rested against the wood.

434
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:25,100
I wonder why he made that surge, he thought.

435
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:28,950
The wire must have slipped on the great hill
of his back.

436
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:32,630
Certainly his back cannot feel as bad as mine
does.

437
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:37,430
But he cannot pull this skiff forever, no
matter how great he is.

438
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:40,649
"Fish." he said softly, aloud.

439
00:26:40,649 --> 00:26:45,180
"I'll stay with you until I am dead."

440
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:51,149
When the sun had risen further the old man
realized that the fish was not getting tired.

441
00:26:51,149 --> 00:26:53,840
There was only one favorable sign.

442
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:57,669
The slam of the line showed he was swimming
at a lesser depth.

443
00:26:57,669 --> 00:27:00,269
That did not mean that he would jump.

444
00:27:00,269 --> 00:27:02,059
But he might.

445
00:27:02,059 --> 00:27:06,250
"God, let him jump," the old man said.

446
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:09,320
"I have enough line to handle him."

447
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:14,640
"Fish," he said, "I love you and respect you
very much.

448
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:19,700
But I will kill you dead before this day ends."

449
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:23,390
A small bird came toward the skiff from the
north.

450
00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:27,670
He was a warbler and the old man could see
he was very tired.

451
00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:31,350
He flew around the old man's head and rested
on the line.

452
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:33,710
"How old are you?"

453
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:35,799
the old man asked the bird.

454
00:27:35,799 --> 00:27:37,750
"Is this your first trip?"

455
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:43,510
The bird was very tired and he teetered on
the line as his delicate feet gripped it.

456
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:47,200
"Take a good rest, small bird," he said.

457
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:54,549
"Then go and take your chance like any man
or bird or fish."

458
00:27:54,549 --> 00:27:59,919
Just then the fish gave a sudden lurch that
pulled the old man down to the bow and would

459
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:05,320
have pulled him overboard if he had not braced
himself and given some line.

460
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:11,610
The bird flew away and he felt the line carefully
with his right hand and noticed his hand was

461
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:12,660
bleeding.

462
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:17,230
Shifting the weight of the line to his left
shoulder and kneeling carefully, he washed

463
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:19,490
his hand in the ocean.

464
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:22,490
The cut was in the working part of his hand.

465
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:27,710
He knew he would need his hands before this
was over and he did not like to be cut before

466
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:29,299
it started.

467
00:28:29,299 --> 00:28:36,630
"Now," he said, "I must eat the small tuna."
he knelt down and found the tuna under the

468
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:37,700
stem.

469
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:42,750
He put one knee on the fish and cut strips
of dark red meat from the back of the head

470
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:44,169
to the tail.

471
00:28:44,169 --> 00:28:48,960
"I don't think I can eat an entire one," he
said.

472
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:54,029
He could feel the steady hard pull of the
line and his left hand was cramped.

473
00:28:54,029 --> 00:28:57,560
"What kind of a hand is that," he said.

474
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:00,059
"Cramp then if you want.

475
00:29:00,059 --> 00:29:02,010
Make yourself into a claw.

476
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:04,860
It will do you no good."

477
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:09,559
He picked up a piece of tuna and put it in
his mouth and chewed it slowly.

478
00:29:09,559 --> 00:29:10,830
It was not unpleasant.

479
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:18,380
"How do you feel, hand?" he asked the cramped
hand that was almost as stiff as rigor mortis,

480
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:21,710
"I'll eat some more for you."

481
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:24,769
I wish I could feed the fish, he thought.

482
00:29:24,769 --> 00:29:26,270
He is my brother.

483
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:30,130
But I must kill him and keep strong to do
it.

484
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:32,519
Slowly he ate all the strips of fish.

485
00:29:32,519 --> 00:29:36,519
"God help me to have the cramp go," he said.

486
00:29:36,519 --> 00:29:40,200
"Because I do not know what the fish is going
to do."

487
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:43,659
What is his plan, he thought.

488
00:29:43,659 --> 00:29:46,700
And what is mine?

489
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:51,090
His left hand was still cramped, but he was
unknotting it slowly.

490
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:53,429
I hate cramps, he thought.

491
00:29:53,429 --> 00:29:55,649
It is a treachery of one's own body.

492
00:29:55,649 --> 00:30:00,040
Then, with his right hand he felt the difference
in the pull of the line.

493
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,860
"He's coming up." he said.

494
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:04,950
"Come on, hand.

495
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:07,049
Please come on."

496
00:30:07,049 --> 00:30:11,970
The line rose slowly and steadily and then
the surface of the ocean bulged ahead of the

497
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:14,700
boat and the fish came out.

498
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:21,000
He came out unendingly and water poured from
his sides.

499
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:27,570
He was bright in the sun and his head and
his sides were wide and colored a light lavender.

500
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:33,160
His sword was as long as a baseball bat and
tapered like a rapier and he rose his full

501
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:38,860
length from the water and then re-entered
it, smoothly, like a diver and the old man

502
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:44,500
saw the great scythe-blade of his tail go
under, and the line started to race out.

503
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:49,680
"He is two feet longer than the skiff," the
old man said.

504
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:54,789
He was trying with both hands to keep the
line just inside of breaking strength.

505
00:30:54,789 --> 00:30:59,480
He knew that if he could not slow the fish
with a steady pressure, the fish could take

506
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:02,559
out all the line and break it.

507
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:08,309
He is a great fish but I must convince him
that he is no match for me, he thought.

508
00:31:08,309 --> 00:31:14,169
I must never let him learn his strength nor
what he could do if he made his run.

509
00:31:14,169 --> 00:31:17,059
The old man had seen many great fish.

510
00:31:17,059 --> 00:31:21,690
He had seen many that weighed more than a
thousand pounds and he had caught two of that

511
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:24,570
size in his life, but never alone.

512
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:30,850
Now alone, and out of sight of land, he was
tied fast to the biggest fish that he had

513
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:37,980
ever seen and bigger than he had ever heard
of, and his left hand was still cramped.

514
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:41,230
I wonder why he jumped, the old man thought.

515
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:45,500
He jumped almost as though to show me how
big he was.

516
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:48,519
I wish I could show him what sort of man I
am.

517
00:31:48,519 --> 00:31:50,820
But then he would see the cramped hand.

518
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:54,929
At noon the old man's left hand was uncramped.

519
00:31:54,929 --> 00:31:59,890
He was comfortable but suffering, although
he did not admit the suffering at all.

520
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:02,919
"I am not religious," he said.

521
00:32:02,919 --> 00:32:10,019
"But I will say ten Our Fathers and ten Hail
Marys so that I can catch this fish, and I

522
00:32:10,019 --> 00:32:17,559
promise to make a pilgrimage to the Virgin
de Cobre if I catch him.

523
00:32:17,559 --> 00:32:21,360
Christ, I did not know he was so big."

524
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,309
"I'll kill him though," he said.

525
00:32:23,309 --> 00:32:27,510
"In all his greatness."

526
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:29,899
Although it is unjust, he thought.

527
00:32:29,899 --> 00:32:34,210
But I will show him what a man can do and
what a man endures.

528
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:39,250
"I told the boy I was a strange old man,"
he said.

529
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:43,059
"Now is when I must prove it."

530
00:32:43,059 --> 00:32:46,350
The thousand times that he had proved it meant
nothing.

531
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:48,700
Now he was proving it again.

532
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:55,220
"If you're not tired, fish." he said aloud,
"you must be very strange."

533
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:59,730
He felt very tired now and he tried to think
of other things.

534
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:04,370
He thought of the Big Leagues, and he knew
the Yankees of New York were playing the Tigers

535
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:06,539
of Detroit.

536
00:33:06,539 --> 00:33:11,700
This is the second day that I do not know
the result of the juegos, he thought.

537
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:17,420
But I must have confidence and I must be worthy
of the great DiMaggio who does all things

538
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:19,630
perfectly.

539
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:24,450
Do you believe the great DiMaggio would stay
with a fish as long as I will stay with this

540
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:26,210
one? he thought.

541
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:30,480
I am sure he would and more since he is young
and strong.

542
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:39,750
Also his father was a fisherman.

543
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:46,279
CHAPTER FOUR
An Even Eight

544
00:33:46,279 --> 00:33:52,559
As the sun set, to give himself more confidence,
he remembered the time in the tavern at Casablanca

545
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:57,880
when he had played the hand game with the
great negro from Cienfuegos, who was the strongest

546
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,940
man on the docks.

547
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:05,539
They had gone one day and one night with their
elbows on a chalk line on the table.

548
00:34:05,539 --> 00:34:09,460
Each one was trying to force the other's hand
down onto the table.

549
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:15,210
They changed the referee every four hours
so that the referees could sleep.

550
00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:18,460
The odds would change back and forth all night.

551
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:24,510
Once the negro had the old man, who was not
an old man then but was Santiago El Campeon,

552
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:27,300
nearly three inches off balance.

553
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:30,050
But the old man had raised his hand again.

554
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:36,750
He was sure then that he had the negro, who
was a fine man and a great athlete, beaten.

555
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:41,450
And at daylight he had forced the hand of
the negro down and down until it rested on

556
00:34:41,450 --> 00:34:42,840
the table.

557
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:49,089
The match had started on a Sunday morning
and ended on a Monday morning.

558
00:34:49,089 --> 00:34:52,040
For a long time everyone had called him "the
Champion."

559
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:55,849
After that he had a few matches and then no
more.

560
00:34:55,849 --> 00:35:00,810
He decided that he could beat anyone if he
wanted to badly enough and he decided that

561
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:05,150
it was bad for his right hand for fishing.

562
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:10,150
Just before it was dark, as they passed a
great island of Sargasso weed, his small line

563
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:12,370
was taken by a dolphin.

564
00:35:12,370 --> 00:35:17,310
He saw it first when it jumped in the air,
bending and flapping wildly.

565
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:21,750
When it was at the stern the old man leaned
over and lifted the burnished gold fish with

566
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:24,510
its purple spots over the stem.

567
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:28,840
Its jaws were working convulsively in quick
bites against the hook.

568
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:33,930
It pounded the bottom of the skiff with its
long flat body, its tail and its head until

569
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:35,380
he clubbed it.

570
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:37,980
Then it shivered and was still.

571
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:43,020
The old man watched the sun go into the ocean
and the slant of the big cord.

572
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:46,800
"He hasn't changed at all," he said.

573
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:53,310
But watching the movement of the water against
his hand he noted that it was a bit slower.

574
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:59,880
"I'll lash the two oars together across the
stern and that will slow him in the night,"

575
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:00,880
he said.

576
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:04,089
"He's good for the night and so am I."

577
00:36:04,089 --> 00:36:07,580
I'm learning how to do it, he thought.

578
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:09,430
This part of it anyway.

579
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:14,940
Then, too, remember he hasn't eaten since
he took the bait and he is huge and needs

580
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:15,940
much food.

581
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:20,450
I have eaten the whole tuna, tomorrow I will
eat the dolphin.

582
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:24,339
"How do you feel, fish?" he asked aloud.

583
00:36:24,339 --> 00:36:31,050
"I feel good and my left hand is better and
I have food for a night and a day.

584
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:33,840
Pull the boat, fish."

585
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:38,990
He did not truly feel good because the pain
from the cord across his back had almost passed

586
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:43,300
pain and gone into a dullness that worried
him.

587
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:46,440
But I have had worse things than that, he
thought.

588
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:50,800
My hand is only cut a little and the cramp
is gone from the other.

589
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,250
My legs are all right.

590
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:58,339
It was dark now as it becomes dark quickly
after the sun sets in September.

591
00:36:58,339 --> 00:37:00,210
The first stars were out.

592
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:05,390
He did not know the name of Rigel but he saw
it and knew that soon they would all be out

593
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:08,810
and he would have all his distant friends.

594
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:13,090
"The fish is my friend too," he said aloud.

595
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:17,079
"I have never seen or heard of such a fish.

596
00:37:17,079 --> 00:37:23,750
But I must kill him, I am glad we do not have
to try to kill the stars."

597
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:28,230
Then he was sorry for the great fish that
had nothing to eat and his determination to

598
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:32,060
kill him never relaxed in his sorrow for him.

599
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:35,200
How many people will he feed, he thought.

600
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,390
But are they worthy to eat him?

601
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:39,390
No, of course not.

602
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:43,770
There is no one worthy of eating a fish with
such great dignity.

603
00:37:43,770 --> 00:37:47,700
The old man rested for what he believed to
be two hours.

604
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:52,720
The moon did not rise until late now and he
had no way of judging the time.

605
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:56,390
He was still bearing the pull of the fish
across his shoulders.

606
00:37:56,390 --> 00:38:00,390
"But you have not slept yet, old man.

607
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:06,890
It is half a day and a night and now another
day and you have not slept," he said aloud.

608
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:12,710
"I must devise a way so that you sleep a little
if he is quiet and steady.

609
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:16,819
If you do not sleep you might become unclear
in the head."

610
00:38:16,819 --> 00:38:20,130
I could go without sleeping, he told himself.

611
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:22,570
But it would be too dangerous.

612
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:25,060
He worked his way back to the stern.

613
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:30,319
The stars were bright now and he saw the dolphin
clearly and he pushed the blade of his knife

614
00:38:30,319 --> 00:38:34,390
into his head and pulled him out from under
the stern.

615
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:39,400
The dolphin was cold and gray-white now in
the starlight and the old man skinned one

616
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:43,490
side of him while he held his right foot on
the fish's head.

617
00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:46,860
Then he skinned the other side and cut fillets.

618
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:50,270
He leaned over the side and put his hand in
the water.

619
00:38:50,270 --> 00:38:53,440
The flow of the water against it was less
strong.

620
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,670
"He is tired or he is resting.

621
00:38:56,670 --> 00:39:02,770
Now let me eat this dolphin and get some rest
and a little sleep."

622
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:06,180
Under the stars he ate half of one of the
dolphin fillets.

623
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:11,109
"What an excellent fish dolphin is to eat
cooked," he said.

624
00:39:11,109 --> 00:39:14,560
"And what a miserable fish raw.

625
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:19,740
I will never go in a boat again without salt
or limes."

626
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:26,080
The sky was clouding over to the east and
one after another the stars he knew were gone.

627
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:31,099
It looked now as though he were moving into
a great canyon of clouds and the wind had

628
00:39:31,099 --> 00:39:32,099
dropped.

629
00:39:32,099 --> 00:39:35,880
"There will be bad weather in three or four
days," he said.

630
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:38,089
"But not tonight or tomorrow.

631
00:39:38,089 --> 00:39:45,540
Right now to get some sleep, old man, while
the fish is calm and steady."

632
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:51,030
The moon had been up for a long time but he
slept on and the fish pulled on steadily and

633
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:53,940
the boat moved into the tunnel of clouds.

634
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:59,480
He woke with the jerk of his right fist coming
up against his face and the line burning out

635
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,760
through his right hand.

636
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:06,010
He could not feel the line with his left hand
but he braked all he could with his right

637
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:09,560
and the line rushed out.

638
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:14,520
Finally his left hand found the line and he
leaned back against it and now it burned his

639
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:17,140
back and his left hand.

640
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:22,510
His left hand was taking all the strain and
it was cutting badly.

641
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:27,640
Just then the fish jumped making a great bursting
of the ocean and then a heavy fall.

642
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:33,530
Then he jumped again and again and the boat
was going fast although line was still racing

643
00:40:33,530 --> 00:40:38,580
out and the old man was raising the strain
to the breaking point.

644
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:44,250
He had been pulled down tight onto the bow
and his face was in the cut slice of dolphin

645
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:46,680
and he could not move.

646
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:49,359
This is what we waited for, he thought.

647
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:51,290
So now let us take it.

648
00:40:51,290 --> 00:40:53,000
Make him pay for the line.

649
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,720
Make him pay for it.

650
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:59,200
He could not see the fish's jumps but only
heard the breaking of the ocean and the heavy

651
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,000
splash as he fell.

652
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:06,970
The speed of the line was cutting his hands
badly but he had always known this would happen.

653
00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:11,380
If the boy were here he would wet the coils
of line, he thought.

654
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:12,380
Yes.

655
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:14,200
If the boy were here.

656
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:19,670
The line went out but it was slowing now and
he was making the fish earn each inch of it.

657
00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:25,810
Now he got his head up from the wood and out
of the slice of fish that his cheek had crushed.

658
00:41:25,810 --> 00:41:29,309
He was on his knees and then he rose to his
feet.

659
00:41:29,309 --> 00:41:33,730
He was giving line but more slowly all the
time.

660
00:41:33,730 --> 00:41:36,680
I wonder what started him so suddenly?

661
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:42,490
Could it have been hunger that made him desperate,
or was he frightened by something in the night?

662
00:41:42,490 --> 00:41:44,740
Maybe he suddenly felt fear.

663
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:50,010
But he was such a calm, strong fish and he
seemed so fearless and so confident.

664
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:51,640
It is strange.

665
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:57,560
"You better be fearless and confident yourself,
old man," he said.

666
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:02,660
The old man held him with his left hand and
stooped down and scooped up water in his right

667
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:06,609
hand to get the crushed dolphin flesh off
his face.

668
00:42:06,609 --> 00:42:12,020
He was afraid that it might nauseate him and
cause him to vomit and lose his strength.

669
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:16,790
He washed his right hand in the water and
then let it stay in the salt water while he

670
00:42:16,790 --> 00:42:20,589
watched the first light come before the sunrise.

671
00:42:20,589 --> 00:42:23,150
He's headed almost east, he thought.

672
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:25,869
That means he is tired and going with the
current.

673
00:42:25,869 --> 00:42:28,410
Soon he will have to circle.

674
00:42:28,410 --> 00:42:31,110
Then our true work begins.

675
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:35,530
After he judged that his right hand had been
in the water long enough he took it out and

676
00:42:35,530 --> 00:42:36,530
looked at it.

677
00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:39,520
"It is not bad," he said.

678
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:43,359
"And pain does not matter to a man."

679
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:47,980
He took hold of the line carefully so that
it did not fit into any of the fresh line

680
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:53,210
cuts and shifted his weight so that he could
put his left hand into the sea on the other

681
00:42:53,210 --> 00:42:55,270
side of the skiff.

682
00:42:55,270 --> 00:43:01,609
"You did not do so badly for something worthless,"
he said to his left hand.

683
00:43:01,609 --> 00:43:06,170
'But there was a moment when I could not find
you."

684
00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:09,560
Why was I not born with two good hands? he
thought.

685
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:13,460
Perhaps it was my fault in not training the
left one properly.

686
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:17,079
But God knows he had enough chances to leant.

687
00:43:17,079 --> 00:43:21,640
He did not do so badly in the night, though,
and he has cramped only once.

688
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:26,380
If he cramps again let the line cut him off.

689
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:31,589
The sun was rising for the third time since
he had got out to sea when the fish started

690
00:43:31,589 --> 00:43:32,589
to circle.

691
00:43:32,589 --> 00:43:36,210
"It is a very big circle," he said.

692
00:43:36,210 --> 00:43:38,730
"But he is circling."

693
00:43:38,730 --> 00:43:41,339
I must hold all I can, he thought.

694
00:43:41,339 --> 00:43:44,440
The strain will shorten his circle each lime.

695
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:47,130
Perhaps in an hour I will see him.

696
00:43:47,130 --> 00:43:51,319
Now I must convince him and then I must kill
him.

697
00:43:51,319 --> 00:43:56,950
But the fish kept on circling slowly and the
old man was wet with sweat and tired deep

698
00:43:56,950 --> 00:43:59,970
into his bones two hours later.

699
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:04,660
But the circles were much shorter now and
from the way the line slanted he could tell

700
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:08,240
the fish had risen steadily while he swam.

701
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:13,750
For an hour the old man had been seeing black
spots before his eyes and the sweat salted

702
00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:18,849
his eyes and salted the cut under his eye
and on his forehead.

703
00:44:18,849 --> 00:44:21,000
He was not afraid of the black spots.

704
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:27,050
Twice, though, he had felt faint and dizzy
and that had worried him.

705
00:44:27,050 --> 00:44:32,390
"I cannot fail and die on a fish like this,"
he said.

706
00:44:32,390 --> 00:44:35,820
"Now that I have him coming so beautifully.

707
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:37,450
God help me endure.

708
00:44:37,450 --> 00:44:41,869
I'll say a hundred Our Fathers and a hundred
Hail Marys.

709
00:44:41,869 --> 00:44:44,660
But I cannot say them now."

710
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:46,720
Consider them said, he thought.

711
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,609
I'll say them later.

712
00:44:48,609 --> 00:44:53,589
Just then he felt a sudden banging and jerking
on the line he held with his two hands.

713
00:44:53,589 --> 00:44:55,839
It was sharp and heavy.

714
00:44:55,839 --> 00:44:59,170
He is hitting the wire with his sword, he
thought.

715
00:44:59,170 --> 00:45:02,559
He may jump and I would rather he circled
now.

716
00:45:02,559 --> 00:45:05,330
The jumps wore necessary for him to take air.

717
00:45:05,330 --> 00:45:11,040
But after that each jump can widen the opening
of the hook wound and he can throw the hook.

718
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:14,630
"Don't jump, fish," he said.

719
00:45:14,630 --> 00:45:16,790
"Don't jump.

720
00:45:16,790 --> 00:45:22,140
The fish hit the wire several times more,
and each time the old man gave up a little

721
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:23,339
line.

722
00:45:23,339 --> 00:45:28,609
After a while the fish stopped beating at
the wire and started circling slowly again.

723
00:45:28,609 --> 00:45:31,170
The old man was gaining line steadily now.

724
00:45:31,170 --> 00:45:33,859
But he felt faint again.

725
00:45:33,859 --> 00:45:38,290
He lifted some sea water with his left hand
and put it on his head.

726
00:45:38,290 --> 00:45:41,650
Then he put more on and rubbed the back of
his neck.

727
00:45:41,650 --> 00:45:44,500
"I have no cramps," ho said.

728
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:47,849
"He'll go up soon and I can last.

729
00:45:47,849 --> 00:45:49,790
You have to last.

730
00:45:49,790 --> 00:45:52,630
Don't oven speak of it."

731
00:45:52,630 --> 00:45:57,480
He kneeled against the bow and, for a moment,
slipped the line over his back again.

732
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:05,150
I'll rest now while he circles and then stand
up and work on him when he comes in, he decided.

733
00:46:05,150 --> 00:46:10,840
I'm more tired than I have ever been, he thought,
and now the trade wind is rising.

734
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:13,770
But that will be good to take him in with.

735
00:46:13,770 --> 00:46:16,329
The sea had risen considerably.

736
00:46:16,329 --> 00:46:20,720
But it was a fair weather breeze and he had
to have it to get home.

737
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:24,559
"I'll just steer south and west," he said.

738
00:46:24,559 --> 00:46:30,030
"A man is never lost at sea and it is a long
island."

739
00:46:30,030 --> 00:46:34,210
It was on the third turn that he saw the fish
for the first time.

740
00:46:34,210 --> 00:46:39,369
He saw him first as a dark shadow that took
so long to pass under the boat that he could

741
00:46:39,369 --> 00:46:41,820
not believe its length.

742
00:46:41,820 --> 00:46:43,910
"No," he said.

743
00:46:43,910 --> 00:46:47,530
"He can't be that big."

744
00:46:47,530 --> 00:46:52,420
But he was that big and at the end of this
circle he came to the surface only thirty

745
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:57,470
yards away and the man saw his tail out of
the water.

746
00:46:57,470 --> 00:47:03,800
It was higher than a big scythe blade and
a very pale lavender above the dark blue water.

747
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:09,420
As the fish swam just below the surface the
old man could see his huge bulk and purple

748
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:10,420
stripes.

749
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:14,270
His dorsal fin was down and his huge pectorals
were spread wide.

750
00:47:14,270 --> 00:47:17,730
Then the old man could see the fish's eye.

751
00:47:17,730 --> 00:47:22,710
The old man was sweating now but from something
else besides the sun.

752
00:47:22,710 --> 00:47:28,490
On each placid turn the fish made he was gaining
line and he was sure that in two turns he

753
00:47:28,490 --> 00:47:32,549
would have a chance to get the harpoon in.

754
00:47:32,549 --> 00:47:36,089
But I must get him close, close, close, he
thought.

755
00:47:36,089 --> 00:47:38,090
I mustn't try for the head.

756
00:47:38,090 --> 00:47:40,180
I must get the heart.

757
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:45,170
"Be calm and strong, old man," he said.

758
00:47:45,170 --> 00:47:50,059
The fish was coming in on his circle now,
calm and beautiful with only his great tail

759
00:47:50,059 --> 00:47:51,460
moving.

760
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:54,819
The old man pulled on him to bring him closer.

761
00:47:54,819 --> 00:47:58,599
For just a moment the fish turned a little
on his side.

762
00:47:58,599 --> 00:48:02,000
Then he straightened himself and began another
circle.

763
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,750
"I moved him."

764
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:04,839
the old man said.

765
00:48:04,839 --> 00:48:07,480
"I moved him then."

766
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:12,109
He felt faint again but he held on to the
great fish with all his strength.

767
00:48:12,109 --> 00:48:14,450
I moved him, he thought.

768
00:48:14,450 --> 00:48:16,750
Maybe this time I can get him over.

769
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:19,230
Pull, hands, he thought.

770
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:20,360
Hold up, legs.

771
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:22,640
Last for me, head.

772
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:23,950
Last for me.

773
00:48:23,950 --> 00:48:25,390
You never went.

774
00:48:25,390 --> 00:48:27,960
This time I'll pull him over.

775
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:33,540
But when he put forth, all of his effort,
the fish righted himself and swam away.

776
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:34,860
"Fish."

777
00:48:34,860 --> 00:48:36,300
the old man said.

778
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:39,869
"Fish, you are going to have to die anyway.

779
00:48:39,869 --> 00:48:42,599
Do you have to kill me too?"

780
00:48:42,599 --> 00:48:46,780
That way nothing is accomplished, he thought.

781
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:51,280
His mouth was too dry to speak but he could
not reach for the water now.

782
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:54,770
I must get him alongside this time, he thought.

783
00:48:54,770 --> 00:48:57,240
I am not good for many more turns.

784
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:59,920
Yes, you are, he told himself.

785
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:02,530
You're good forever.

786
00:49:02,530 --> 00:49:05,240
On the next turn, he nearly had him.

787
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:09,400
But again the fish righted himself and swam
away slowly.

788
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:12,680
You are killing me, fish, the old man thought.

789
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:14,630
But you have a right to.

790
00:49:14,630 --> 00:49:20,350
Never have I seen a greater or more beautiful
or a calmer or more noble thing than you,

791
00:49:20,350 --> 00:49:21,350
brother.

792
00:49:21,350 --> 00:49:22,910
Come on and kill me.

793
00:49:22,910 --> 00:49:24,890
I do not care who kills who.

794
00:49:24,890 --> 00:49:28,320
Now you are getting confused in the head,
he thought.

795
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:33,089
You must keep your head clear and know how
to suffer like a man or a fish.

796
00:49:33,089 --> 00:49:37,690
"Clear up, head." he said in a voice he could
hardly hear.

797
00:49:37,690 --> 00:49:39,300
"Clear up."

798
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:44,200
He tried it once more and he felt himself
going when he turned the fish.

799
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:50,780
The fish righted himself and swam off again
slowly with the great tail moving in the air.

800
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:56,430
I'll try it again, the old man promised, although
his hands were mushy now and he could only

801
00:49:56,430 --> 00:50:08,560
see well in flashes.

802
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:14,230
CHAPTER FIVE
Shark Attack

803
00:50:14,230 --> 00:50:19,700
He took all his pain and what was left of
his strength and his long-gone pride and he

804
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:22,220
put it against the fish's agony.

805
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:27,990
The fish came over onto his side and swam
gently and started to pass the boat.

806
00:50:27,990 --> 00:50:32,920
The old man dropped the line and put his foot
on it and lifted the harpoon as high as he

807
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:38,970
could and drove it down with all his strength
into the fish's side just behind the great

808
00:50:38,970 --> 00:50:40,359
chest fin.

809
00:50:40,359 --> 00:50:45,490
He felt the iron go in and he leaned on it
and drove it further and then pushed all his

810
00:50:45,490 --> 00:50:47,549
weight after it.

811
00:50:47,549 --> 00:50:52,849
Then the fish came alive, with his death in
him, and rose high out of the water showing

812
00:50:52,849 --> 00:50:57,720
all his great length and width and all his
power and his beauty.

813
00:50:57,720 --> 00:51:01,750
He seemed to hang in the air above the old
man in the skiff.

814
00:51:01,750 --> 00:51:05,819
Then he fell into the water with a crash.

815
00:51:05,819 --> 00:51:09,799
The old man felt faint and sick and he could
not see well.

816
00:51:09,799 --> 00:51:14,819
But he cleared the harpoon line and let it
run slowly through his raw hands and when

817
00:51:14,819 --> 00:51:20,730
he could see, he saw the fish was on his back
with his silver belly up.

818
00:51:20,730 --> 00:51:25,569
The shaft of the harpoon was projecting at
an angle from the fish's shoulder and the

819
00:51:25,569 --> 00:51:28,780
sea was red with the blood from his heart.

820
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:33,569
The fish was silvery and still and floated
with the waves.

821
00:51:33,569 --> 00:51:36,240
The old man laid his head on his hands.

822
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:39,430
"Keep my head clear," he said.

823
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:42,390
"I am a tired old man.

824
00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:48,730
But I have killed this fish which is my brother
and now I must do the slave work."

825
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:54,130
Now I must prepare the rope to tie him alongside
the skiff, he thought.

826
00:51:54,130 --> 00:51:57,230
This skiff will never hold him.

827
00:51:57,230 --> 00:52:01,460
He started to pull the fish in to have him
alongside the skiff.

828
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:05,799
I want to see him, he thought, and to touch
and to feel him.

829
00:52:05,799 --> 00:52:08,390
He is my fortune, he thought.

830
00:52:08,390 --> 00:52:10,690
But that is not why I wish to feel him.

831
00:52:10,690 --> 00:52:15,790
I think I felt his heart when I pushed on
the harpoon the second time.

832
00:52:15,790 --> 00:52:20,700
Bring him in now and get the noose around
his tail and another around his middle to

833
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:23,160
tie him to the skiff.

834
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:27,800
"Get to work, old man," he said.

835
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:30,210
He took a very small drink of water.

836
00:52:30,210 --> 00:52:35,619
"There is much slave work to do now that the
fight is over."

837
00:52:35,619 --> 00:52:39,380
He looked up at the sky and then out to his
fish.

838
00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:42,829
"Come on, fish," he said.

839
00:52:42,829 --> 00:52:48,420
But the fish did not come, instead he lay
there and the old man pulled the skiff up

840
00:52:48,420 --> 00:52:50,260
to him.

841
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:54,869
When the fish's head was against the bow he
could not believe his size.

842
00:52:54,869 --> 00:53:02,300
"It was the only way to kill him," the old
man said, he was feeling better and his head

843
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:07,609
was clear, he's over fifteen hundred pounds,
he thought.

844
00:53:07,609 --> 00:53:09,020
Maybe much more.

845
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:14,440
"I think the great DiMaggio would be proud
of me today."

846
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:19,319
He fastened the fish, to the bow, to the stem
and to the middle thwart.

847
00:53:19,319 --> 00:53:23,950
He was so big it was like lashing a much bigger
skiff alongside.

848
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:28,960
He could see the fish and he had only to look
at his hands and feel his back against the

849
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:34,890
stem to know that this had truly happened
and was not a dream.

850
00:53:34,890 --> 00:53:39,599
They were sailing together lashed side by
side and the old man thought, let him bring

851
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:41,760
me in if it pleases him.

852
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:46,069
I am only better than him through trickery
and he meant me no harm.

853
00:53:46,069 --> 00:53:49,180
It was an hour before the first shark hit
him.

854
00:53:49,180 --> 00:53:54,049
The shark had come up from deep down in the
water as the dark cloud of blood had settled

855
00:53:54,049 --> 00:53:56,960
and dispersed in the mile-deep sea.

856
00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:02,790
He had come up so fast that he broke the surface
of the blue water and was in the sun.

857
00:54:02,790 --> 00:54:07,720
Then he fell back into the sea and picked
up the scent and started following the skiff

858
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:10,970
and the fish.

859
00:54:10,970 --> 00:54:12,520
Sometimes he lost the scent.

860
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:16,250
But he would pick it up again and he swam
fast and hard.

861
00:54:16,250 --> 00:54:21,960
He was a very big Mako shark built to swim
as fast as the fastest fish in the sea and

862
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:25,840
everything about him was beautiful except
his jaws.

863
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:31,040
His back was as blue as a swordfish's and
his belly was silver and his hide was smooth

864
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:32,970
and handsome.

865
00:54:32,970 --> 00:54:38,750
Inside the closed double lip of his jaws all
of his eight rows of teeth were slanted inwards.

866
00:54:38,750 --> 00:54:42,420
They were not the ordinary pyramid-shaped
teeth of most sharks.

867
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:46,940
They wore shaped like a man's fingers when
they are curled like claws.

868
00:54:46,940 --> 00:54:51,510
They were nearly as long as the fingers of
the old man and they had razor-sharp cutting

869
00:54:51,510 --> 00:54:54,020
edges on both sides.

870
00:54:54,020 --> 00:54:59,230
When the old man saw him coming he knew that
this was a shark that had no fear at all and

871
00:54:59,230 --> 00:55:01,730
would do exactly what he wished.

872
00:55:01,730 --> 00:55:06,310
He prepared the harpoon and the rope while
he watched the shark come forward.

873
00:55:06,310 --> 00:55:11,650
The old man's head was clear and good now
and he was full of resolution but he had little

874
00:55:11,650 --> 00:55:12,650
hope.

875
00:55:12,650 --> 00:55:17,440
It was too good to last, he thought, it might
as well have been a dream.

876
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:21,039
I cannot keep him from hitting me but maybe
I can get him.

877
00:55:21,039 --> 00:55:23,170
Dentuso, he thought.

878
00:55:23,170 --> 00:55:26,170
Bad luck to your mother.

879
00:55:26,170 --> 00:55:31,069
When the shark hit the fish the old man saw
his mouth open and his strange eyes.

880
00:55:31,069 --> 00:55:36,190
He heard the clicking sound of the teeth as
he tore into the meat just above the tail.

881
00:55:36,190 --> 00:55:40,430
He rammed the harpoon down into the shark's
head and into his brain.

882
00:55:40,430 --> 00:55:44,780
He hit it with his bloody hands driving the
harpoon with all his strength.

883
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:49,740
He hit it without hope but with resolution
and complete malignancy.

884
00:55:49,740 --> 00:55:54,060
The shark swung over and the old man saw his
eye was not alive.

885
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:58,050
The old man knew that he was dead but the
shark would not accept it.

886
00:55:58,050 --> 00:56:01,160
It ploughed over the water as a speed boat
does.

887
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:05,670
Then he lay quietly for a little while and
went down very slowly.

888
00:56:05,670 --> 00:56:11,289
"He took about forty pounds and my harpoon,"
the old man said.

889
00:56:11,289 --> 00:56:15,809
He did not like to look at the fish any more
since he had been mutilated.

890
00:56:15,809 --> 00:56:19,140
When the fish had been hit it was as though
he himself were hit.

891
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:22,150
It was too good to last, he thought.

892
00:56:22,150 --> 00:56:26,990
I wish it had been a dream now and that I
had never hooked the fish and was alone in

893
00:56:26,990 --> 00:56:28,819
bed on the newspapers.

894
00:56:28,819 --> 00:56:33,119
"But man is not made for defeat," he said.

895
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:37,130
"A man can be destroyed but not defeated."

896
00:56:37,130 --> 00:56:40,650
I am sorry that I killed the fish though,
he thought.

897
00:56:40,650 --> 00:56:44,549
Now the bad time is coming and I do not even
have the harpoon.

898
00:56:44,549 --> 00:56:47,960
"Don't think, old man," he said aloud.

899
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:52,470
"Sail on and take it when it comes."

900
00:56:52,470 --> 00:56:56,780
He knew quite well the pattern of what could
happen when he readied the inner part of the

901
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:57,780
current.

902
00:56:57,780 --> 00:56:59,829
But there was nothing to be done now.

903
00:56:59,829 --> 00:57:02,829
"Yes, there is," he said aloud.

904
00:57:02,829 --> 00:57:06,950
"I can lash my knife to the butt of one of
the oars."

905
00:57:06,950 --> 00:57:08,230
So he did that.

906
00:57:08,230 --> 00:57:11,060
"Now, I am still an old man.

907
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:13,520
But I am not unarmed."

908
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:18,770
He watched only the forward part of the fish
and some of his hope returned.

909
00:57:18,770 --> 00:57:21,020
It is silly not to hope, he thought.

910
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:23,520
Besides I believe it is a sin.

911
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:25,430
Do not think about sin.

912
00:57:25,430 --> 00:57:28,190
There are enough problems now without sin.

913
00:57:28,190 --> 00:57:32,370
I have no understanding of it and I am not
sure that I believe in it.

914
00:57:32,370 --> 00:57:35,010
Perhaps it was a sin to kill the fish.

915
00:57:35,010 --> 00:57:40,539
I suppose it was though I did it to keep me
alive and feed many people.

916
00:57:40,539 --> 00:57:42,790
But then everything is a sin.

917
00:57:42,790 --> 00:57:44,549
Do not think about sin.

918
00:57:44,549 --> 00:57:47,380
You were born to be a fisherman.

919
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:52,300
You did not kill the fish only to keep alive
and to sell for food, he thought.

920
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:56,069
You killed him for pride and because you are
a fisherman.

921
00:57:56,069 --> 00:57:59,700
You loved him when he was alive and you loved
him after.

922
00:57:59,700 --> 00:58:02,430
If you love him it is not a sin to kill him.

923
00:58:02,430 --> 00:58:04,620
Or is it more?

924
00:58:04,620 --> 00:58:07,940
But you enjoyed killing the dentuso, he thought.

925
00:58:07,940 --> 00:58:12,099
"I killed him in self-defense," the old man
said aloud.

926
00:58:12,099 --> 00:58:13,790
"And I killed him well."

927
00:58:13,790 --> 00:58:20,089
Besides, he thought, everything kills everything
else in some way.

928
00:58:20,089 --> 00:58:23,210
Fishing kills me exactly as it keeps me alive.

929
00:58:23,210 --> 00:58:24,990
The boy keeps me alive.

930
00:58:24,990 --> 00:58:36,460
I must not deceive myself too much.

931
00:58:36,460 --> 00:58:41,000
CHAPTER SIX
The Final Battle

932
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:45,420
He had been sailing for two hours when he
saw the first of the two sharks.

933
00:58:45,420 --> 00:58:48,530
"Galanos," he said aloud.

934
00:58:48,530 --> 00:58:51,190
He took up the oar with the knife lashed to
it.

935
00:58:51,190 --> 00:58:56,270
He lifted it as lightly as he could because
his hands rebelled at the pain, and he watched

936
00:58:56,270 --> 00:58:57,849
the sharks come. 

937
00:58:57,849 --> 00:59:03,720
They were hateful sharks, bad-smelling scavengers
as well as killers, and when they were hungry

938
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:07,099
they would bite at an oar or the rudder of
a boat.

939
00:59:07,099 --> 00:59:09,920
"Ay," the old man said.

940
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:11,210
"Galanos.

941
00:59:11,210 --> 00:59:13,099
Come on, galanos."

942
00:59:13,099 --> 00:59:14,990
They came.

943
00:59:14,990 --> 00:59:19,299
One turned and went out of sight under the
skiff and the old man could feel the skiff

944
00:59:19,299 --> 00:59:22,630
shake as he jerked and pulled on the fish.

945
00:59:22,630 --> 00:59:27,650
The other watched the old man with his yellow
eyes and then came in fast to hit the fish

946
00:59:27,650 --> 00:59:30,110
where he had already been bitten.

947
00:59:30,110 --> 00:59:35,450
A line showed clearly on the top of his brown
head and back where the brain joined the spinal

948
00:59:35,450 --> 00:59:41,190
cord and the old man drove the knife on the
oar into the brain, withdrew it, and drove

949
00:59:41,190 --> 00:59:45,250
it in again into the shark's yellow cat-like
eyes.

950
00:59:45,250 --> 00:59:52,190
The shark let go of the fish and slid down,
swallowing what he had taken as he died.

951
00:59:52,190 --> 00:59:56,150
When he saw the other shark he leaned over
the side and punched him.

952
00:59:56,150 --> 00:59:58,640
The blow hurt his hands and his shoulder.

953
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:03,260
But the shark came up fast with his head out
and the old man hit him squarely in the center

954
01:00:03,260 --> 01:00:05,549
of his flat-topped head.

955
01:00:05,549 --> 01:00:10,579
The old man withdrew the blade and punched
the shark exactly in the same spot again.

956
01:00:10,579 --> 01:00:15,400
The old man stabbed him in his left eye but
the shark still hung there.

957
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:16,400
"No?"

958
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:21,580
the old man said and he drove the blade between
the vertebrae and the brain and he felt the

959
01:00:21,580 --> 01:00:23,109
cartilage break.

960
01:00:23,109 --> 01:00:25,030
"Go on, galano.

961
01:00:25,030 --> 01:00:26,980
Slide down a mile deep.

962
01:00:26,980 --> 01:00:30,869
Go and see your friend, or maybe it's your
mother."

963
01:00:30,869 --> 01:00:34,849
The old man wiped the blade of his knife and
laid down the oar.

964
01:00:34,849 --> 01:00:37,470
Then he brought the skiff onto her course.

965
01:00:37,470 --> 01:00:42,710
"They must have taken a quarter of him and
of the best meat," he said aloud.

966
01:00:42,710 --> 01:00:46,930
"I wish it were a dream and that I had never
hooked him.

967
01:00:46,930 --> 01:00:49,410
I'm sorry about it, fish.

968
01:00:49,410 --> 01:00:51,920
It makes everything wrong."

969
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:55,940
He stopped and he did not want to look at
the fish now.

970
01:00:55,940 --> 01:01:00,589
"I shouldn't have gone out so far, fish,"
he said.

971
01:01:00,589 --> 01:01:03,250
"Neither for you nor for me.

972
01:01:03,250 --> 01:01:05,240
I'm sorry, fish.

973
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:09,109
God knows how much that last one took," he
continued.

974
01:01:09,109 --> 01:01:11,970
"But she's much lighter now."

975
01:01:11,970 --> 01:01:16,270
He did not want to think of the mutilated
under-side of the fish.

976
01:01:16,270 --> 01:01:19,770
He was a fish to keep a man all winter, he
thought.

977
01:01:19,770 --> 01:01:21,180
Don't think of that.

978
01:01:21,180 --> 01:01:25,609
Just rest and try to get your hands in shape
to defend what is left of him.

979
01:01:25,609 --> 01:01:28,890
The next shark that came was a single shovel-nose.

980
01:01:28,890 --> 01:01:33,230
He came like a pig to the trough if a pig
had a mouth so wide that you could put your

981
01:01:33,230 --> 01:01:34,230
head in it.

982
01:01:34,230 --> 01:01:39,950
The old man let him hit the fish and then
drove the knife on the oar down into his brain.

983
01:01:39,950 --> 01:01:45,619
But tire shark jerked backwards as he rolled
and the knife blade snapped.

984
01:01:45,619 --> 01:01:50,260
The old man did not even watch the big shark
sinking slowly in the water.

985
01:01:50,260 --> 01:01:53,430
"I have the gaff now." he said.

986
01:01:53,430 --> 01:01:56,140
"But it will do no good.

987
01:01:56,140 --> 01:02:00,790
I have the two oars and the tiller and the
short dub."

988
01:02:00,790 --> 01:02:03,270
Now they have beaten me, he thought.

989
01:02:03,270 --> 01:02:06,170
I am too old to club sharks to death.

990
01:02:06,170 --> 01:02:12,520
But I will try it as long as I have the oars
and the short club and the tiller.

991
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:17,200
It was getting late in the afternoon and he
saw nothing but the sea and the sky.

992
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:20,420
"You're tired, old man," he said.

993
01:02:20,420 --> 01:02:21,910
"You're tired inside."

994
01:02:21,910 --> 01:02:27,180
The sharks did not hit him again until just
before sunset.

995
01:02:27,180 --> 01:02:30,839
He blocked the tiller and reached under the
stern for the club.

996
01:02:30,839 --> 01:02:33,800
It was an oar handle from a broken oar.

997
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:38,770
The two sharks closed together and as he saw
the one nearest him open his jaws and sink

998
01:02:38,770 --> 01:02:44,440
them into the silver side of the fish, he
raised the club high and brought it down heavy

999
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:47,250
on the top of the shark's broad head.

1000
01:02:47,250 --> 01:02:52,369
He struck the shark once more hard across
the point of the nose as he slid down from

1001
01:02:52,369 --> 01:02:53,910
the fish.

1002
01:02:53,910 --> 01:02:57,839
The other shark now came in again with his
jaws wide.

1003
01:02:57,839 --> 01:03:02,559
The old man could see pieces of the meat of
the fish spilling white from the corner of

1004
01:03:02,559 --> 01:03:04,029
his jaws.

1005
01:03:04,029 --> 01:03:09,660
He swung at him and hit only the head and
the shark looked at him and tore the meat

1006
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:10,660
loose.

1007
01:03:10,660 --> 01:03:13,319
The old man swung the club down on him again.

1008
01:03:13,319 --> 01:03:17,040
"Come on, galano," the old man said.

1009
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:19,630
"Come in again."

1010
01:03:19,630 --> 01:03:24,559
The shark came in and the old man hit him
as he shut his jaws.

1011
01:03:24,559 --> 01:03:28,960
He hit him solidly and front as high up as
he could raise the club.

1012
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:33,870
This time he felt the bone at the base of
the brain and he hit him again in the same

1013
01:03:33,870 --> 01:03:34,870
place.

1014
01:03:34,870 --> 01:03:38,119
The old man watched but neither shark returned.

1015
01:03:38,119 --> 01:03:40,460
He did not want to look at the fish.

1016
01:03:40,460 --> 01:03:43,520
He knew that half of him had been destroyed.

1017
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:47,109
The sun had gone down while he had been fighting
the sharks.

1018
01:03:47,109 --> 01:03:50,510
"It will be dark soon." he said.

1019
01:03:50,510 --> 01:03:53,839
"Then I should see the glow of Havana.

1020
01:03:53,839 --> 01:03:59,779
If I am too far to the east I will see the
lights of one of the new beaches."

1021
01:03:59,779 --> 01:04:05,460
He could not talk to the fish anymore because
the fish had been ruined too badly.

1022
01:04:05,460 --> 01:04:08,000
Then something came into his head.

1023
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,020
"Half-fish," he said.

1024
01:04:10,020 --> 01:04:11,680
"Fish that you were.

1025
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:14,810
I am sorry that went too far out.

1026
01:04:14,810 --> 01:04:16,560
I ruined us both.

1027
01:04:16,560 --> 01:04:22,660
But we have killed many sharks, you and I,
and ruined many others.

1028
01:04:22,660 --> 01:04:25,700
How many did you ever kill, old fish?

1029
01:04:25,700 --> 01:04:30,990
You do not have that spear on your head for
nothing."

1030
01:04:30,990 --> 01:04:33,530
I have half of him. he thought.

1031
01:04:33,530 --> 01:04:36,339
Maybe I'll have the luck to bring the forward
half in.

1032
01:04:36,339 --> 01:04:38,180
I should have some luck.

1033
01:04:38,180 --> 01:04:39,410
''No," he said.

1034
01:04:39,410 --> 01:04:43,330
"You violated your luck when you went too
far outside."

1035
01:04:43,330 --> 01:04:46,150
"Don't be silly," he said aloud.

1036
01:04:46,150 --> 01:04:48,760
"You may have much luck yet.

1037
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:54,119
I'd like to buy some if there were any place
they sell it," he said.

1038
01:04:54,119 --> 01:04:57,060
What could I buy it with? he asked himself.

1039
01:04:57,060 --> 01:05:01,880
Could I buy it with a lost harpoon and a broken
knife and two bad hands?

1040
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:04,039
"You might," he said.

1041
01:05:04,039 --> 01:05:07,809
"You tried to buy it with eighty-four days
at sea.

1042
01:05:07,809 --> 01:05:10,700
They nearly sold it to you too."

1043
01:05:10,700 --> 01:05:15,420
He saw the reflected glare of the lights of
the city at what must have been around ten

1044
01:05:15,420 --> 01:05:17,069
o'clock at night.

1045
01:05:17,069 --> 01:05:22,750
He steered inside of the glow and he thought
that now, soon, he must hit the edge of the

1046
01:05:22,750 --> 01:05:23,750
stream.

1047
01:05:23,750 --> 01:05:26,180
Now it is over, he thought.

1048
01:05:26,180 --> 01:05:28,390
They will probably hit me again.

1049
01:05:28,390 --> 01:05:32,329
But what can a man do against them in the
dark without a weapon?

1050
01:05:32,329 --> 01:05:36,930
I hope I do not have to fight again, he thought.

1051
01:05:36,930 --> 01:05:41,340
But by midnight he fought and this time he
knew the fight was useless.

1052
01:05:41,340 --> 01:05:43,099
They came in a pack.

1053
01:05:43,099 --> 01:05:47,829
He dubbed desperately at what he could only
feel and hear and he felt something seize

1054
01:05:47,829 --> 01:05:50,359
the dub and it was gone.

1055
01:05:50,359 --> 01:05:54,950
He jerked the tiller free from the rudder
and beat and chopped with it holding it in

1056
01:05:54,950 --> 01:05:58,670
both hands and driving it down again and again.

1057
01:05:58,670 --> 01:06:04,760
One came, finally, against the head itself
and he knew that it was over.

1058
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:07,780
He swung the tiller across the shark's head.

1059
01:06:07,780 --> 01:06:10,910
He swung it once and twice and again.

1060
01:06:10,910 --> 01:06:13,049
The shark let go and rolled away.

1061
01:06:13,049 --> 01:06:17,099
That was the last shark of the pack that came.

1062
01:06:17,099 --> 01:06:19,720
There was nothing more for them to eat.

1063
01:06:19,720 --> 01:06:24,819
The old man could hardly breathe now and he
felt a strange taste in his mouth.

1064
01:06:24,819 --> 01:06:29,150
It was coppery and sweet and he was afraid
of it for a moment.

1065
01:06:29,150 --> 01:06:33,839
He spat into the ocean and said, "Eat that,
galanos."

1066
01:06:33,839 --> 01:06:37,779
He knew he was beaten now finally and without
remedy.

1067
01:06:37,779 --> 01:06:42,369
He put the sack around his shoulders and put
the skiff on her course.

1068
01:06:42,369 --> 01:06:45,660
He had no thoughts nor any feelings of any
kind.

1069
01:06:45,660 --> 01:06:50,940
He only noticed how lightly and how well the
skiff sailed now that there was no great weight

1070
01:06:50,940 --> 01:06:52,700
beside her.

1071
01:06:52,700 --> 01:06:57,619
He could feel he was inside the current now
and he could see the lights of the beach along

1072
01:06:57,619 --> 01:06:59,890
the shore.

1073
01:06:59,890 --> 01:07:04,119
When he sailed into the little harbor the
lights of the Terrace were out and he knew

1074
01:07:04,119 --> 01:07:06,290
everyone was in bed.

1075
01:07:06,290 --> 01:07:10,750
He pulled the boat up and then he stepped
out and tied her to a rock.

1076
01:07:10,750 --> 01:07:15,260
He took the mast out of its step and furled
the sail and tied it.

1077
01:07:15,260 --> 01:07:20,670
Then he put the mast on his shoulder and started
to climb, it was then that he knew the depth

1078
01:07:20,670 --> 01:07:22,200
of his tiredness.

1079
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:27,280
He stopped and looked back and saw the white
naked line of the fish's backbone and the

1080
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:32,569
dark mass of the head with the bill and all
the nakedness in between.

1081
01:07:32,569 --> 01:07:37,820
He started to climb again and at the top he
fell and lay for some time with the mast across

1082
01:07:37,820 --> 01:07:39,130
his shoulder.

1083
01:07:39,130 --> 01:07:40,620
He tried to get up.

1084
01:07:40,620 --> 01:07:45,760
But it was too difficult and he sat there
with the mast on his shoulder.

1085
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:48,380
Finally he put the mast down and stood up.

1086
01:07:48,380 --> 01:07:53,270
He picked the mast up and put it on his shoulder
and started up the road.

1087
01:07:53,270 --> 01:07:58,180
He had to sit down five times before he reached
his shack.

1088
01:07:58,180 --> 01:08:01,220
Inside the shack he leaned the mast against
the wall.

1089
01:08:01,220 --> 01:08:04,819
In the dark he found a water bottle and took
a drink.

1090
01:08:04,819 --> 01:08:06,770
Then he lay down on the bed.

1091
01:08:06,770 --> 01:08:11,800
He pulled the blanket over his body and he
slept face down on the newspapers with his

1092
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:15,520
arms out straight and the palms of his hands
up.

1093
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:19,000
He was asleep when the boy looked in the door
in the morning.

1094
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:22,640
The boy saw the old man's hands and he started
to cry.

1095
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:30,180
He went out very quietly to get some coffee
and all the way down the road he was crying.

1096
01:08:30,180 --> 01:08:35,300
Many fishermen were around the skiff looking
at what was lashed beside it and one was in

1097
01:08:35,300 --> 01:08:39,700
the water, his trousers rolled up, measuring
the skeleton.

1098
01:08:39,700 --> 01:08:41,810
The boy did not go down.

1099
01:08:41,810 --> 01:08:46,840
He had been there before and one of the fishermen
was looking after the skiff for him.

1100
01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:51,080
"How is he?" one of the fishermen shouted.

1101
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:53,890
"Sleeping," the boy called.

1102
01:08:53,890 --> 01:08:56,280
He did not care that they saw him crying.

1103
01:08:56,280 --> 01:08:58,620
"Let no one disturb him."

1104
01:08:58,620 --> 01:09:04,920
"He was eighteen feet from nose to tail,"
the fisherman who was measuring him called.

1105
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:06,680
"I believe it."

1106
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:08,260
the boy said.

1107
01:09:08,260 --> 01:09:11,940
He went into the Terrace and asked for a can
of coffee.

1108
01:09:11,940 --> 01:09:15,480
"Hot and with plenty of milk and sugar in
it."

1109
01:09:15,480 --> 01:09:17,450
"Anything more?"

1110
01:09:17,450 --> 01:09:18,450
"No.

1111
01:09:18,450 --> 01:09:21,223
Afterwards I will see what he can eat."

1112
01:09:21,223 --> 01:09:24,270
"What a fish it was," the proprietor said.

1113
01:09:24,270 --> 01:09:27,350
"There has never been such a fish.

1114
01:09:27,350 --> 01:09:30,250
Tell him how sorry l am."

1115
01:09:30,250 --> 01:09:33,520
"Thanks," the boy said.

1116
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:38,760
The boy carried the hot can of coffee up to
the old man's shack and sat by him until he

1117
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:40,290
woke.

1118
01:09:40,290 --> 01:09:41,780
Finally the old man woke.

1119
01:09:41,780 --> 01:09:44,590
"Don't sit up," the boy said.

1120
01:09:44,590 --> 01:09:46,220
"Drink this."

1121
01:09:46,220 --> 01:09:48,920
He poured some of the coffee in a glass.

1122
01:09:48,920 --> 01:09:51,040
The old man took it and drank it.

1123
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:54,410
"They beat me, Manolin," he said.

1124
01:09:54,410 --> 01:09:56,890
"They truly beat me."

1125
01:09:56,890 --> 01:09:58,790
"He didn't beat you.

1126
01:09:58,790 --> 01:10:00,460
Not the fish."

1127
01:10:00,460 --> 01:10:01,620
"No.

1128
01:10:01,620 --> 01:10:02,780
Truly.

1129
01:10:02,780 --> 01:10:03,780
It was afterwards."

1130
01:10:03,780 --> 01:10:07,610
"Pedrico is looking after the skiff and the
gear.

1131
01:10:07,610 --> 01:10:10,580
What do you want done with the head?"

1132
01:10:10,580 --> 01:10:14,290
"Let Pedrico chop it up to use in fish traps."

1133
01:10:14,290 --> 01:10:16,120
"And the spear?"

1134
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:18,730
"You keep it if you want it."

1135
01:10:18,730 --> 01:10:21,180
"I want it," the boy said.

1136
01:10:21,180 --> 01:10:24,470
"Now we must make our plans about the other
things."

1137
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:27,500
"Did they search for me?"

1138
01:10:27,500 --> 01:10:29,040
"Of course.

1139
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:30,750
With coast guard and with planes."

1140
01:10:30,750 --> 01:10:39,600
"The ocean is very big and a skiff is small
and hard to see," the old man said.

1141
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:45,160
He noticed how pleasant it was to have someone
to talk to instead of speaking only to himself

1142
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:46,460
and to the sea.

1143
01:10:46,460 --> 01:10:49,500
"I missed you," he said.

1144
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:51,740
"What did you catch?"

1145
01:10:51,740 --> 01:10:54,060
"One the first day.

1146
01:10:54,060 --> 01:10:56,470
One the second and two the third."

1147
01:10:56,470 --> 01:10:58,100
"Very good."

1148
01:10:58,100 --> 01:11:01,340
"Now we can fish together again."

1149
01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:02,340
"No.

1150
01:11:02,340 --> 01:11:04,250
I am not lucky.

1151
01:11:04,250 --> 01:11:05,990
I am not lucky anymore."

1152
01:11:05,990 --> 01:11:09,460
"The hell with luck," the boy said.

1153
01:11:09,460 --> 01:11:11,230
"I'll bring the luck with me."

1154
01:11:11,230 --> 01:11:14,460
"What will your family say?"

1155
01:11:14,460 --> 01:11:16,290
"I do not care.

1156
01:11:16,290 --> 01:11:18,300
I caught two yesterday.

1157
01:11:18,300 --> 01:11:22,500
But we will fish together now for I still
have much to learn.

1158
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:24,750
You get your hands well, old man."

1159
01:11:24,750 --> 01:11:27,850
"I know how to care for them.

1160
01:11:27,850 --> 01:11:32,940
In the night I spat something strange and
felt something in my chest was broken."

1161
01:11:32,940 --> 01:11:36,650
"Get that well too," the boy said.

1162
01:11:36,650 --> 01:11:38,810
"Lie down, old man.

1163
01:11:38,810 --> 01:11:40,790
I will bring you your clean shirt.

1164
01:11:40,790 --> 01:11:41,790
And something to eat."

1165
01:11:41,790 --> 01:11:48,030
"Bring any of the papers of the time that
I was gone," the old man said.

1166
01:11:48,030 --> 01:11:54,140
"You must get well fast for there is much
that I can learn and you can teach me everything.

1167
01:11:54,140 --> 01:11:55,510
How much did you suffer?"

1168
01:11:55,510 --> 01:11:58,470
"Plenty," the old man said.

1169
01:11:58,470 --> 01:12:02,120
"I'll bring the food and the papers," the
boy said.

1170
01:12:02,120 --> 01:12:04,310
"Rest well, old man.

1171
01:12:04,310 --> 01:12:08,160
I will bring something from the drugstore
for your hands."

1172
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:12,320
As the boy went out the door and down the
road he was crying again.

1173
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:17,700
That afternoon there was a party of tourists
at the Terrace and looking down in the water

1174
01:12:17,700 --> 01:12:24,080
among the empty beer cans and dead barracudas
a woman saw a great long white spine with

1175
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:28,140
a huge tail at the end that lifted and swung
with the tide.

1176
01:12:28,140 --> 01:12:29,470
"What's that?"

1177
01:12:29,470 --> 01:12:35,660
she asked a waiter and pointed to the long
backbone of the great fish that was now just

1178
01:12:35,660 --> 01:12:39,070
garbage waiting to go out with the tide.

1179
01:12:39,070 --> 01:12:43,430
"Tiburon," the waiter said, "Eshark."

1180
01:12:43,430 --> 01:12:45,600
He wanted to explain what had happened.

1181
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:50,080
"I didn't know sharks had such handsome, beautifully
formed tails."

1182
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:52,620
"I didn't either."

1183
01:12:52,620 --> 01:12:55,450
her male companion said.

1184
01:12:55,450 --> 01:12:59,730
Up the road, in his shack, the old man was
sleeping again.

1185
01:12:59,730 --> 01:13:05,210
He was still sleeping on his face and the
boy was sitting by him watching him.

1186
01:13:05,210 --> 01:13:07,460
The old man was dreaming about the lions.

1187
01:13:07,460 --> 01:13:07,690
- THE END -
