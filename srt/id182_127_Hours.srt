1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:04,600
127 HOURS

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:08,560
PROLOGUE
You are going to die.

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:11,290
I hear the voice in my head.

4
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:13,550
I call it my first voice.

5
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:18,179
It always comes after I've made some kind
of mistake.

6
00:00:18,179 --> 00:00:23,380
Its words never help, they just make me feel
bad.

7
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:26,449
So I wait for the second voice.

8
00:00:26,449 --> 00:00:31,229
Its words are calm and sensible and nearly
always help me.

9
00:00:31,229 --> 00:00:35,609
I wait, but tonight the second voice doesn't
come.

10
00:00:35,609 --> 00:00:38,920
There is only silence, darkness and cold.

11
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:43,700
In the first days, the second voice always
came.

12
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:47,890
It stopped me feeling sad, angry, or afraid.

13
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:50,079
It gave me ideas.

14
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,679
It showed me things.

15
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:55,289
It brought me hope.

16
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:57,960
I believed I could be free again.

17
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,899
But, slowly, that voice disappeared.

18
00:01:01,899 --> 00:01:04,629
My belief disappeared with it.

19
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:07,110
Now there is only the first voice.

20
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:11,240
It says the same thing over and over again.

21
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:17,300
Finally, I must accept the truth: I am going
to die.

22
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:20,900
CHAPTER ONE
'The most beautiful place on Earth'

23
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:27,460
It is Saturday, April the 26th, 2003.

24
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:30,400
My name is Aron Ralston.

25
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:36,130
I'm biking and hiking in Canyonlands National
Park in southeast Utah, USA.

26
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:41,960
Edward Abbey, one of my favourite writers,
described it as 'the most beautiful place

27
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,040
on Earth'.

28
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:49,220
Right now, with the sun on my back and the
wind in my hair, I agree.

29
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:52,490
Today is the third day of an activity holiday.

30
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:59,570
It started on Thursday when I went climbing
and skiing on Mount Soplis with my friend,

31
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:00,570
Brad.

32
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:04,240
Yesterday, I biked the Slick Rock Trail, alone.

33
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:10,810
It's not very long - only a little over nineteen
kilometres - but it's one of the most difficult

34
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:13,290
bike trails in the US.

35
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:19,310
Today, my plan is to hike through Blue John
and Horseshoe Canyons after biking to the

36
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:20,870
trail.

37
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:25,890
I'll leave my bike at the end of the trail
and hike back to the carpark.

38
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:30,920
I'll drive over in the truck and collect the
bike later.

39
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:37,060
After that, I'll drive to Goblin Valley, about
eighty kilometres north of here.

40
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:40,120
My friends are having a party there.

41
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:45,650
I hope I get some sleep because tomorrow I
want to hike the most popular trail in southern

42
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:48,260
Utah - Little White Horse.

43
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:53,900
I plan to spend the whole of Monday biking
along the White Rim Trail.

44
00:02:53,900 --> 00:03:00,319
The trail forms a rough circle of 175 kilometres.

45
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:04,930
It's not difficult and I should be able to
finish in about eighteen hours.

46
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:08,101
By Monday evening, I'll be back in Aspen,
Colorado.

47
00:03:08,101 --> 00:03:14,720
Aspen is famous for its mountains and the
countryside around it.

48
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,360
It's a popular place for skiing.

49
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:23,380
I live there and I work for Ute Mountaineer,
a sports equipment shop.

50
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:30,569
Leona, one of the people I live and work with,
is having a goodbye party on Monday night.

51
00:03:30,569 --> 00:03:36,310
Now that winter is over, she's going to another
town in Colorado to work as a gardener for

52
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,530
the summer.

53
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:42,000
Her party will be a cool way to end my trip.

54
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,010
00 hrs

55
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:51,910
8.45 am I arrive at the Horseshoe Canyon carpark
early in the morning, pull my bike from the

56
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:53,470
truck and lock the door.

57
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:57,940
Then I check the time: eight forty-five in
the morning.

58
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:04,930
As I start cycling, I wonder how quickly I
can get to the start of the trail.

59
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:09,030
I can now see the sign pointing to this end
of the trail.

60
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:13,840
That means I've cycled thirteen kilometres
in less than two hours.

61
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,840
That's good.

62
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:21,289
It will give me more time to finish my hike
back to the truck.

63
00:04:21,289 --> 00:04:25,659
I lock my bike to a tree and start walking.

64
00:04:25,659 --> 00:04:31,139
As I walk, I think about the history of the
people who were here before me.

65
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:35,169
One of them, Butch Cassidy, was very famous.

66
00:04:35,169 --> 00:04:40,219
He and his men stole horses and hid from the
law during the last years of the nineteenth

67
00:04:40,219 --> 00:04:42,279
century.

68
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:47,530
Since that time, the area has been called
Robbers Roost country.

69
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:51,790
My climbing bag is heavy with the weight of
my equipment.

70
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:54,330
I think about my plan for the day.

71
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:59,910
Blue John Canyon will be the most difficult
part of the hike.

72
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:03,990
Three kilometres along the trail is the Big
Drop Rappel.

73
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:08,210
Here, the canyon suddenly drops eighteen metres.

74
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:14,069
The hardest part is 180 metres before this.

75
00:05:14,069 --> 00:05:19,569
The walls there are very narrow and the trail
goes up and down, sharply.

76
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:24,960
There are also a lot of very large rocks called
boulders, stuck between the canyon walls.

77
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:30,610
If these boulders move or fall, they can be
dangerous.

78
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:33,400
But I'm not thinking of danger at the moment.

79
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,729
I am excited.

80
00:05:35,729 --> 00:05:38,450
Today, I will finally see the Great Gallery.

81
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:45,180
The Gallery is part of Horseshoe Canyon, and
it's famous for the huge rock paintings which

82
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:47,680
cover its walls.

83
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,520
Some of them are more than five thousand years
old.

84
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,340
I should reach my truck by late afternoon.

85
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:58,360
So far, things are going well.

86
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,900
I arrived here earlier than I thought.

87
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:06,380
This gives me a little more time to finish
my trip.

88
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:10,669
I always get very excited when I'm about to
leave on a trip.

89
00:06:10,669 --> 00:06:14,190
This means I sometimes forget things.

90
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:20,339
Before starting this trip, I forgot to leave
a message telling anyone exactly where I was

91
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:21,339
going.

92
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:24,860
This is one of the things my mother taught
me.

93
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:32,520
But this time, I just called a quick goodbye
to my housemates - Brian, Joe, and Leona.

94
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,589
Leona asked where I was going.

95
00:06:35,589 --> 00:06:41,229
I told her I was going to Utah and promised
to be back for her party.

96
00:06:41,229 --> 00:06:45,210
Then I got in my truck and drove away.

97
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:47,279
I can't wait for adventure.

98
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:51,310
It makes me feel happier than anything.

99
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:54,099
It's part of who I am.

100
00:06:54,099 --> 00:06:57,720
I'm on a high rock, looking down at the trail.

101
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,379
I've stopped because I can hear voices.

102
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:03,449
This surprises me.

103
00:07:03,449 --> 00:07:05,460
I had expected to be alone.

104
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:09,689
Two young women suddenly appear below me.

105
00:07:09,689 --> 00:07:11,879
I feel pleased.

106
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:14,850
I've spent the last eighteen hours alone.

107
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:19,159
It will be good to have company for a while.

108
00:07:19,159 --> 00:07:22,479
'Hi,' I call as I climb down the rock.

109
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:25,729
The girls hadn't noticed me.

110
00:07:25,729 --> 00:07:29,050
They turn, looking a little nervous.

111
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:33,330
I guess they are about twenty-five years old.

112
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:37,750
I smile and hold out my hand, 'My name's Aron.'

113
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,389
They smile back.

114
00:07:39,389 --> 00:07:44,770
'I'm Megan,' says the darker girl, 'and this
is Kristi.'

115
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:48,590
We shake hands and continue along the trail.

116
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:52,379
As we go, we talk about our interests.

117
00:07:52,379 --> 00:07:56,389
We all love hiking, biking and adventures.

118
00:07:56,389 --> 00:08:01,309
For all of us, this is more important than
earning a lot of money.

119
00:08:01,309 --> 00:08:04,569
They work in the same business, too.

120
00:08:04,569 --> 00:08:09,710
They work for Outward Bound, a sports equipment
shop in Moab, Utah.

121
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:16,179
Both Aspen and Moab are important tourist
centres for hikers.

122
00:08:16,179 --> 00:08:20,050
We are on the trail together for about five
kilometres.

123
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:24,279
At that point, there is a smaller canyon to
the west.

124
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:27,740
The west canyon goes back in a half-circle.

125
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:32,020
The girls left their bikes at the end of it.

126
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:37,959
We will say goodbye there and I'll continue
on alone to the Big Drop Rappel.

127
00:08:37,959 --> 00:08:41,789
We arrive just before 2.00 pm.

128
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:44,090
I don't feel like saying goodbye.

129
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:50,230
In the hour and a half we've been together,
we've already become friends.

130
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:52,580
Megan feels the same.

131
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:55,000
'Why don't you come with us?'

132
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,100
she asks.

133
00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:03,490
'We can finish the west canyon trail, go back
to our truck and have a few beers.'

134
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:08,699
I like the idea, but following my plan is
more important.

135
00:09:08,699 --> 00:09:10,600
I ask them to come with me.

136
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:14,329
'How far is it back to your truck?'

137
00:09:14,329 --> 00:09:16,829
Megan asks.

138
00:09:16,829 --> 00:09:19,220
'Around thirteen kilometres.'

139
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:22,110
'That's too far.

140
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:25,580
You won't get back before dark,' she says.

141
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:30,060
'Maybe not, but I really want to do the Big
Drop Rappel.

142
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:34,779
And I can't miss the paintings in the Great
Gallery.

143
00:09:34,779 --> 00:09:37,880
I'll meet you after for a drink.'

144
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:42,860
We agree on a plan to meet and go to the party
together.

145
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:45,139
Then I turn and wave goodbye.

146
00:09:45,139 --> 00:09:49,829
The movement is so easy I don't think about
it.

147
00:09:49,829 --> 00:09:51,690
But there is something I don't know.

148
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:57,329
It is the last time I will wave goodbye with
my right hand.

149
00:09:57,329 --> 00:10:00,959
CHAPTER TWO
The accident

150
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:04,520
The girls disappear into the west canyon.

151
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,430
I am alone again.

152
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:10,750
I continue walking towards the Big Drop Rappel.

153
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:15,920
It seems strangely quiet without Kristi and
Megan.

154
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:22,790
I turn on my CD player and listen to a soft,
slow song by Phish, one of my favourite bands.

155
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:29,100
The music is perfect for the way I feel: lucky,
free and happy.

156
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:32,009
The weather is perfect, too.

157
00:10:32,009 --> 00:10:36,690
It's warm and sunny with just a few white
clouds in the sky.

158
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:42,970
Suddenly, my feet hit a pile of loose stones
and I nearly fall to the ground.

159
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:45,829
Careful, Aron.

160
00:10:45,829 --> 00:10:50,070
I listen to the voice in my head and look
up the canyon.

161
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:53,250
I can see that the trail ahead becomes more
difficult.

162
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:59,620
The Big Drop Rappel is now just under a kilometre
away.

163
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:04,350
Twenty minutes later, I arrive at the most
difficult part of the trail.

164
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:08,080
Here, the canyon walls are a lot narrower.

165
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:13,190
The trail rises and falls and is full of sharp
rocks.

166
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:15,690
I will have to be careful.

167
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:19,720
I look up and see part of a tree stuck between
the canyon walls.

168
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:24,050
It was carried along the canyon after heavy
rain.

169
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:28,870
This is one of the dangers of hiking in canyon
country.

170
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:32,850
After a sudden storm, canyons can quickly
fill with water.

171
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:39,250
In seconds, the water can throw you against
the canyon walls and kill you.

172
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:45,190
That's why it's always very important to check
the weather before canyoning.

173
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:49,230
Just below the tree is the first drop in the
trail.

174
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:54,470
It's only about three metres, so I won't need
any equipment.

175
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:59,439
There are plenty of holes in the rock for
my hands and feet so I climb down easily.

176
00:11:59,439 --> 00:12:04,310
A metre from the bottom I let go and land
on the ground.

177
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:08,500
Soft sand covers the tops of my boots.

178
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:12,379
From here, it would be difficult to climb
back up.

179
00:12:12,379 --> 00:12:16,360
One thing is immediately clear: I can't go
back.

180
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:20,779
The canyon walls become even narrower.

181
00:12:20,779 --> 00:12:25,709
Stuck between them, as far as I can see, are
boulders of different sizes.

182
00:12:25,709 --> 00:12:29,209
It's an unusual sight.

183
00:12:29,209 --> 00:12:32,449
I stop and take a few pictures with my camera.

184
00:12:32,449 --> 00:12:39,839
The Big Drop Rappel is now only about 160
metres away.

185
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,399
Climbing down will be no problem.

186
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:45,600
I have all the equipment I need in my backpack.

187
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,839
For food, I have two burritos.

188
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,672
I also have a full water bottle and an extra
two litres in a CamelBak.

189
00:12:53,672 --> 00:12:58,750
The boulders are both good and bad news.

190
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:04,300
The good news is that I should be able to
climb over many of them.

191
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:08,750
This will be quicker than dropping on to the
trail and climbing back up again.

192
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:12,910
The bad news is that the boulders could move.

193
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:14,680
I will have to be careful.

194
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:21,009
I manage the first few boulders without any
problems and reach another drop.

195
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:24,220
This one is about four metres down.

196
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:29,029
About three metres from the edge of the drop
is a boulder.

197
00:13:29,029 --> 00:13:32,420
It's about the same size as the wheel of a
bus.

198
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:37,060
If I climb onto it, the drop from there will
be shorter.

199
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:40,870
I chimney to the boulder quite easily.

200
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:44,160
As I stand on it, I feel something move.

201
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,209
The movement stops almost immediately.

202
00:13:47,209 --> 00:13:51,699
It seems there's nothing to worry about.

203
00:13:51,699 --> 00:13:57,350
I lie down, put my hands in two holes on the
far edge of the boulder and push my legs over

204
00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:00,860
the opposite side to jump down.

205
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:06,569
As most of my weight pushes on one side of
the boulder, it makes a strange sound.

206
00:14:06,569 --> 00:14:11,949
Immediately I know this is trouble but it's
too late to go back.

207
00:14:11,949 --> 00:14:15,910
From this point, everything seems to happen
very slowly.

208
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:20,470
I let go of the boulder and drop towards the
ground.

209
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:25,870
As I fall, I look up and see the boulder crashing
towards my head.

210
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:29,330
If I don't get out of the way, I'm dead.

211
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:32,740
I try to push against the boulder with both
hands.

212
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:37,100
It hits my left hand hard against the canyon
wall.

213
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:40,110
I pull it back with a scream of pain.

214
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:46,980
The boulder then hits my right arm and traps
my hand against the right side of the canyon.

215
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:49,500
6 hrs

216
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:54,820
2.45 pm All this happens in a couple of seconds.

217
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:58,740
I don't even notice landing on the canyon
floor.

218
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:01,529
I am so shocked I feel no pain.

219
00:15:01,529 --> 00:15:06,830
I just stand there, looking at my trapped
hand in disbelief.

220
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:09,510
Stupid, Aron, stupid!

221
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:13,189
When you first stood on the rock, it moved.

222
00:15:13,189 --> 00:15:17,230
That was a clear message to stay away!

223
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:21,519
But you were in such a hurry to finish the
hike you didn't stop and check.

224
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:24,830
The voice in my head doesn't help.

225
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:27,579
It just makes things worse.

226
00:15:27,579 --> 00:15:31,740
A terrible pain travels up my arm.

227
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:35,519
I scream and pull hard to try and free myself.

228
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,060
Nothing happens.

229
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:40,389
I try again.

230
00:15:40,389 --> 00:15:45,730
This time I push against the boulder with
my knees at the same time.

231
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:47,589
It's no good.

232
00:15:47,589 --> 00:15:50,339
The boulder is a lot heavier than I am.

233
00:15:50,339 --> 00:15:54,040
I am stuck and there's no way out.

234
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:58,220
CHAPTER THREE
Three plans

235
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:01,329
Stop thinking about how bad the problem is,
Aron.

236
00:16:01,329 --> 00:16:04,779
You need to be sensible.

237
00:16:04,779 --> 00:16:07,579
The voice in my head is right.

238
00:16:07,579 --> 00:16:09,449
I must be sensible.

239
00:16:09,449 --> 00:16:12,329
This has to be my rule from now on.

240
00:16:12,329 --> 00:16:17,209
The first thing I need is a drink.

241
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:21,870
Without stopping to think, I take the water
bottle from my bag and drink a third of it

242
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:24,569
in five seconds.

243
00:16:24,569 --> 00:16:29,320
I suddenly realise what I'm doing and pull
the bottle out of my mouth.

244
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:34,350
Already, I have broken my rule to be sensible.

245
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:38,310
I have no idea how long I will be here.

246
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:42,610
This means that the most important thing of
all is to save water.

247
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:45,939
Damn it, Aron!

248
00:16:45,939 --> 00:16:47,050
Stupid!

249
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:48,160
Stupid!

250
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,259
Stupid!

251
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:53,699
6 hrs 43 mins

252
00:16:53,699 --> 00:16:58,740
3.28 pm It's almost forty-five minutes since
my accident.

253
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:02,180
I am calmer than before.

254
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:07,340
For the last half hour, I've been thinking
of my best chance of escape.

255
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:11,600
I said I would meet Kristi and Megan after
the hike.

256
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:15,890
If I don't appear, will they go to my truck
to find me?

257
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:18,120
I won't be there.

258
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:22,150
But will they realise that something is wrong
and go for help?

259
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:25,080
The answer is probably 'no'.

260
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:29,400
Kristi and Megan don't know me very well.

261
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:33,170
They'll just think that I decided not to meet
them.

262
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:35,430
What about other hikers?

263
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:38,000
Will they find me by chance?

264
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,260
Again, the answer is probably 'no'.

265
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:47,310
Very few people travel to the Great Gallery
from this end of the trail.

266
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:50,510
My friends won't worry, either.

267
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:53,910
They weren't completely sure I was going to
the party.

268
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:59,850
Even on Monday evening, my housemates will
just think I'm late getting back.

269
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:03,080
No one will miss me until Tuesday morning.

270
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:10,060
When I don't arrive for work, Brion After,
my boss, will know that something is wrong.

271
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:13,360
I am never late for work.

272
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:18,830
He will probably call my family and they will
tell the police that I am missing.

273
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:25,040
But I didn't tell anyone exactly where I was
going, so it will take the police days to

274
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,870
find me.

275
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:31,390
If I don't escape before then, I will die.

276
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:35,510
All of this means that I will have to get
out of here alone.

277
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:37,370
But how?

278
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:39,960
I can think of three possible plans.

279
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:45,820
The first plan is to use the large knife on
the multi-tool to chip at the boulder.

280
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:50,690
This might take away enough of the rock to
free my hand.

281
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:55,390
The second plan is to try and lift the boulder
using some of my equipment.

282
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:59,080
The third plan is the worst.

283
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,800
I could amputate my arm using the multi-tool.

284
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:06,990
It's too soon to think of that idea.

285
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:09,270
I try plan one.

286
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:12,310
I take the multi-tool from my climbing bag.

287
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:15,600
It has two knives.

288
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,570
One is longer than the other.

289
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:22,070
I use the longest one, which is not so sharp.

290
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:28,040
To free my hand, I must remove a piece of
rock over fifteen centimetres wide and seven

291
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,460
centimetres deep.

292
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,200
That's a lot of rock.

293
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:36,280
10 hrs 15 mins

294
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:42,950
7.0 pm I've been chipping at the rock for
almost three and a half hours.

295
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:44,780
I stop for a drink of water.

296
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:49,960
I lay the multi-tool on the boulder and reach
for the water bottle.

297
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:54,710
This time I am more careful and take only
a sip.

298
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:59,970
I wonder how long I'll be able to survive
with the water I have left, only two-thirds

299
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:01,990
of a litre.

300
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:04,610
Until Monday night, maybe?

301
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:07,430
Tuesday morning at the latest.

302
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:12,310
CHAPTER FOUR
Night and day

303
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:17,630
After Kristi and Megan left Aron, they got
lost in the west canyon and arrived late at

304
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:19,810
the meeting place.

305
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:22,480
He wasn't there.

306
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:27,910
'He's probably left already,' said Megan,
'but he can't be far away.

307
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:31,170
Let's drive around and see if we can find
him.'

308
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:35,910
But there was no sign of Aron or his bike.

309
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:38,740
'It doesn't really matter,' said Megan.

310
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:41,770
'We'll see him at the party.'

311
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:44,310
Again, she was wrong.

312
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:49,940
By the time they reached Goblin Valley, the
car park was full and there was nowhere to

313
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:51,540
stay for the night.

314
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:57,300
The girls now felt very tired and decided
not to go to the party.

315
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:02,820
'We'll drive to Little Wild Horse Canyon tomorrow
morning,' said Megan.

316
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:06,210
'We'll probably find Aron there.'

317
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:11,090
Kristi agreed and they parked by the side
of the road for the night.

318
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:17,670
The next morning, there was no sign of Aron
at Little Wild Horse Canyon.

319
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:23,430
All they found was a truck from Colorado with
a bike inside and skis on the roof.

320
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:27,330
'That's probably Aron's truck,' said Megan.

321
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:31,030
'He must be in the canyon already.

322
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:33,220
We've missed him again.'

323
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:38,450
She wrote their email addresses on a piece
of paper and left it on the truck window.

324
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:42,370
'Why didn't we just get his phone number?'

325
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:45,930
Megan asked as they drove back to Moab.

326
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:49,250
15 hrs 15 mins

327
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:54,680
12.00 am My headlamp is on and I'm chipping
at the boulder.

328
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:59,250
I've managed to chip a space above and below
an area of pink rock.

329
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:04,950
Perhaps I can remove this large piece before
I stop for the night.

330
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:07,480
I will need to hit it hard.

331
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:11,800
I don't want to break the knife, so I use
a different part of the multi-tool.

332
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:19,150
I hit the boulder as hard as I can and the
piece of rock falls onto my trapped arm.

333
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:21,660
I can now see some softer rock below.

334
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:28,250
I chip at the rock for another hour and remove
as much as the piece that came off before.

335
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:34,370
More success, but my left arm hurts and I
have to stop.

336
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:35,840
I take a sip of water.

337
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:40,630
I have decided to do this every ninety minutes.

338
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:42,310
I look up at the sky.

339
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:46,940
It's a clear night and it's very cold.

340
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:49,940
Now that I've stopped chipping I feel cold.

341
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:52,320
The wind is the worst.

342
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:57,670
Every few minutes, it blows down the canyon
and makes my body shake.

343
00:22:57,670 --> 00:23:03,120
I decide to use my climbing bag as a jacket
to keep warm.

344
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:07,330
I lay everything inside it on top of the boulder.

345
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:09,850
Then I put the bag back on.

346
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:14,850
I'm a little warmer but I need something soft
to put my legs on.

347
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:20,510
I take my rope, form it into a circle, and
lay it on a rock below me.

348
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:25,980
Now I can rest my knees instead of standing
up all the time.

349
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:29,910
After a while, I begin to feel uncomfortable
again.

350
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:33,370
The problem is the weight on my legs.

351
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:37,340
I decide to try and build some kind of seat.

352
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:40,490
I put on my harness and rope.

353
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:45,990
Then I tie carabiners to one end of the rope
and make a kind of ball.

354
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:51,330
The idea is to throw the rope over one of
the boulders above my head.

355
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:57,220
If I do it right, the ball will stick in the
space between the boulder and the canyon wall.

356
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:02,450
It takes twenty-five throws before it lands
in the right place.

357
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:05,670
Now, will it hold my weight?

358
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:09,010
I sit in the harness.

359
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:10,700
It holds.

360
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:11,700
Success!

361
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:14,120
I feel very happy.

362
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,780
But I'm not comfortable for long.

363
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:19,640
I soon need to move again.

364
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:24,450
I stand and chip for twenty minutes, then
sit and rest for twenty minutes.

365
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:28,420
This becomes my routine.

366
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:32,850
As morning comes, I'm not feeling too unhappy.

367
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:36,330
This first night was not as bad as I thought.

368
00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:42,570
I've done quite well, but one thought still
worries me: I haven't chipped much rock from

369
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:43,690
the boulder.

370
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:50,870
At this speed, it will take me 150 hours to
free my trapped arm.

371
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:52,800
Chipping is not enough.

372
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:56,120
I will have to think of something else.

373
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,870
CHAPTER FIVE
A sad message

374
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:03,550
23 hrs 30 mins

375
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:07,100
8.15 am I am feeling optimistic.

376
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:13,730
The sun is shining into the canyon and a raven
has just flown across the blue sky above my

377
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:14,730
head.

378
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:19,220
The sight and sound of the bird fills me with
hope.

379
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:21,720
I hold my leg in the sunlight.

380
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:25,540
It feels warm against my skin.

381
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:27,090
But I need to do something.

382
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:30,810
It's time for plan two.

383
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:37,600
I will use my ropes, webbing and carabiners
to try and lift the boulder and free my hand.

384
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,570
I look up.

385
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:42,820
There's a sharp piece of rock above my head.

386
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:49,360
If I can throw the rope around this, it might
hold everything in the right position.

387
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,770
After many tries, I finally succeed.

388
00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:56,310
I tie the other end of the rope around the
boulder.

389
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:59,620
But when I pull, nothing happens.

390
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:03,710
Everything holds, but the boulder doesn't
move.

391
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:08,180
I put more weight on the rope, but it still
doesn't work.

392
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:10,370
The rope is not tight enough.

393
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:14,180
28 hrs 15 mins

394
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:20,880
1.00 pm I've spent four hours trying to lift
the boulder, but nothing has worked.

395
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,680
Suddenly, I hear voices.

396
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,930
'Help!

397
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:26,190
Help!'

398
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:28,700
I shout.

399
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,440
I stop and listen.

400
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:33,820
At first, there's nothing.

401
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:37,410
But then I hear a sound from above and realise
my mistake.

402
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:41,290
It's just a small animal moving in the rock.

403
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:44,280
I'd imagined it was people.

404
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:48,300
The sound of my voice shouting for help frightened
me.

405
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:51,630
It made me feel lost and alone.

406
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:55,280
I make a promise that I won't do it again.

407
00:26:55,280 --> 00:27:00,010
The optimistic feelings of earlier in the
day have disappeared.

408
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:03,490
No one is going to save me.

409
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:10,370
That leaves only the third, and worst, plan:
I will have to amputate my right arm.

410
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:12,290
What will I need for the job?

411
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:17,390
The knife, that's certain, but also a tourniquet
to stop the blood.

412
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:22,270
The plastic pipe from the CamelBak seems best
for that.

413
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:25,920
I take it off and use a carabiner to make
it tight.

414
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:30,550
It works well and I feel a bit better.

415
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:35,750
As soon as I put the knife against the skin
of my arm, I feel ill.

416
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:37,750
I can't do it.

417
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:40,560
It would be like killing myself.

418
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:44,280
I drop the knife and lay my head on the boulder.

419
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:47,160
None of my plans have worked.

420
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,770
I can't free my hand.

421
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:51,540
I can't lift the boulder.

422
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:55,260
I can't amputate my arm.

423
00:27:55,260 --> 00:28:00,510
My only hope is rescue, but I'll die before
help arrives.

424
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:05,560
I feel angry with the boulder, but it's not
the boulder's fault - it's mine.

425
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:09,090
Everything about this stupid adventure was
a mistake.

426
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:15,310
I didn't tell anyone where I was going, I
didn't go with Kristi and Megan to the west

427
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:19,350
canyon, and I didn't get off the boulder when
it moved.

428
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:21,930
30 hrs

429
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:28,310
2.45 pm It's exactly twenty-four hours since
the accident.

430
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:33,240
I decide it's time to film a message for my
family and friends.

431
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:38,260
I place my camcorder on the boulder, turn
it on and start speaking.

432
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:41,920
'My name is Aron Ralston.

433
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,190
It's just after three o'clock on Sunday, April
the 27th, 2003.

434
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:54,140
I have been trapped in Blue John Canyon for
the last twenty-four hours.

435
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:58,630
My parents are Donna and Larry Ralston of
Eaglewood, Colorado.

436
00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:02,760
If anyone finds this, please give it to them.

437
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,450
Thank you.'

438
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:09,600
I describe all that has happened in the last
two days.

439
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:14,290
As I reach the end of my story, I feel very
sad.

440
00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:20,360
I know this could be a final goodbye to my
parents and sister, Sonja.

441
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:25,020
After telling them how much I love them, there
is only one more thing to say.

442
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:29,070
'Mum, Dad, Sonja - I'm sorry.'

443
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:31,860
I turn off the machine.

444
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:36,260
All I can do now is wait for someone to find
me.

445
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:38,720
CHAPTER SIX
Waiting

446
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:43,130
33 hrs 15 mins

447
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:48,110
6.00 pm My second night in the canyon is moving
closer.

448
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:51,570
Beyond that, I see no future.

449
00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:57,610
Escape has been impossible and I will die
before anyone finds me.

450
00:29:57,610 --> 00:30:04,020
I feel strong enough to survive the fear of
death, but not my body's need for water.

451
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:08,570
This terrible, growing thirst will drive me
crazy.

452
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:12,000
I now have only a quarter of a litre of water
left.

453
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,720
I have to make this last as long as possible.

454
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:21,940
I drank at 3.15 pm, just after I finished
filming.

455
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:26,530
Then I missed the next drink and decided to
save it for later.

456
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:31,980
I'll drink at nine, midnight, three and six
in the morning, but I'll take even smaller

457
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:32,980
sips.

458
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:36,840
The mosquitoes have found me.

459
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:41,710
There are several at my feet and some drinking
the blood on the canyon wall.

460
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:45,050
I kill five or six as they circle around my
head.

461
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:47,950
Can I eat them, I wonder?

462
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:53,590
Even if I could, it wouldn't be enough to
keep me alive.

463
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:55,560
I go back to waiting.

464
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:59,270
It seems colder than the night before.

465
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:02,840
I start chipping at the boulder just to keep
warm.

466
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:06,750
36 hrs 15 mins

467
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:09,630
9.00 pm Night has fallen.

468
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:12,240
The mosquitoes have gone.

469
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:17,500
The sky above is beautiful: clear with bright
stars.

470
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:20,900
But clear skies mean lower temperatures.

471
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:25,090
I must do something to cover more of my body.

472
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:28,080
I tie the camera bag around my left arm.

473
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:35,240
Then I tie webbing around my right arm and
put rope around each of my legs.

474
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:38,900
I do the same for my right arm, using webbing.

475
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:42,020
I put rope round each leg.

476
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:45,700
It looks funny and I can't help smiling.

477
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:50,640
I begin my routine of standing and sitting.

478
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:56,760
Most of my body feels warmer, but I'm still
shaking because my head and neck are cold.

479
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:01,040
I decide to put the plastic rope bag over
my head.

480
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:05,120
I keep the far end open to let fresh air in.

481
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,080
I lay my head against the boulder.

482
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:11,690
I still can't sleep but at least I'm warmer.

483
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:16,920
The long, boring hours of the night pass slowly
by.

484
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:19,800
Finally, the sky grows lighter.

485
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:23,590
Today, it's a dirty white colour.

486
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:25,141
I wonder if this is cloud.

487
00:32:25,141 --> 00:32:31,150
Clouds at night are good because they trap
the day's heat in the canyon, but clouds during

488
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:34,900
the day are bad because the sun doesn't warm
the air.

489
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:39,260
There's also the chance of a storm.

490
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:41,910
Slowly the pale sky turns bright blue.

491
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:44,860
It's going to be hot again.

492
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:50,100
As always, the light and warm air make me
want to do something.

493
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:55,460
I try and lift the boulder again by pushing
down on the rope with my feet.

494
00:32:55,460 --> 00:33:01,020
This doesn't work either and I feel suddenly
hopeless.

495
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,230
What more can I do?

496
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:07,730
No voice inside my head suggests anything
useful.

497
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:13,770
All I see in my mind are pictures of the food
and drink left on the floor of my truck.

498
00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:17,490
I think again about amputating my arm.

499
00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:20,940
I didn't try hard enough the last time.

500
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:24,400
I need to be brave and try again.

501
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,990
I put on the tourniquet and make it tight.

502
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:33,680
When everything is ready, I try to cut through
the skin of my arm with the longer knife.

503
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:37,140
I push hard but the skin doesn't break.

504
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:42,560
Then, over the same area, I use the shorter,
sharper knife.

505
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:45,290
But even that doesn't work.

506
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:49,840
It's still not sharp enough to do the job.

507
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:55,860
All I have for the time I've spent on this
is a long red line across my right arm.

508
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:59,640
I take off the tourniquet and go back to waiting.

509
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:03,640
47 hrs 30 mins

510
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:07,010
8.15 am The raven appears.

511
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:08,639
I check my watch.

512
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:13,310
It has arrived at exactly the same time as
yesterday.

513
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:18,730
For the first time in two days, I need to
urinate.

514
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:24,510
I open my shorts and watch the yellow urine
disappear into the sand.

515
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:29,820
I spend most of the day chipping, resting,
and counting the minutes before my next drink

516
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:31,300
of water.

517
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:34,030
54 hrs

518
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:40,650
2.45 pm It's the middle of the afternoon and
time to film again.

519
00:34:40,650 --> 00:34:43,740
Filming has now become a part of my daily
routine.

520
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:47,110
I turn on the camcorder.

521
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:50,120
'Hi, everyone.

522
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:53,440
It's Monday, April the 28th.

523
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,610
I'm still trapped.

524
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:59,950
I've been here for exactly forty-eight hours.

525
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:04,200
That's two whole days with no sleep and very
little water.

526
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:08,550
I now have only about one-eighth of a litre
left.'

527
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:11,570
I continue with a message to my sister, Sonja.

528
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:15,650
She is getting married in the autumn.

529
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:20,780
I tell her how proud I am of her and send
her my love and best wishes.

530
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:25,970
I finish filming at 3.35 pm.

531
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:29,510
It's strange but I feel the need to urinate
again.

532
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:35,710
This time, my second voice tells me not to
urinate on the ground.

533
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:36,710
Save it, Aron.

534
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:41,830
It will soon be all you have to drink.

535
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:42,990
It's good advice.

536
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:45,480
I urinate into the CamelBak.

537
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:49,060
The urine is now a dark orange colour.

538
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:52,470
The other urine was clearer.

539
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:54,470
Why didn't I save it?

540
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:58,560
57 hrs 15 mins

541
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:02,440
6.00 pm It's early evening.

542
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:06,450
Sunlight shines off the bottom of thin clouds
high above me.

543
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:10,890
I hope they will stay and keep the heat in
the canyon.

544
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:14,830
But as time passes, it seems to grow colder.

545
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:17,560
My water won't last much longer.

546
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:22,450
Soon, I will have to start drinking urine.

547
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:26,810
Like the raven, the mosquitoes seem to arrive
on time.

548
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:28,970
I kill a few more.

549
00:36:28,970 --> 00:36:34,330
Mosquitoes mean there must be water quite
close - probably at the Big Drop Rappel.

550
00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:36,830
Forget it, Aron.

551
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:40,090
You'll never see water again.

552
00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:43,060
The first voice is back.

553
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:45,280
I try not to listen.

554
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:49,760
CHAPTER SEVEN
'Where's Aron?'

555
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:54,740
Back in Aspen, Aron's housemates were preparing
for the party.

556
00:36:54,740 --> 00:37:01,110
Elliot, another friend of his, was moving
into the house after Leona had gone.

557
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:05,390
At eight-thirty, he asked, 'Has anyone seen
Aron?'

558
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:08,430
'No,' said Brian.

559
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:10,140
'He's probably still on his trip.'

560
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:13,570
'Does he know about the party?'

561
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:15,270
Elliot asked.

562
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:18,770
'Of course,' said Leona.

563
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:21,850
'He said he'd be here for sure.

564
00:37:21,850 --> 00:37:23,820
He'd better come.

565
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:26,170
It's my goodbye party.

566
00:37:26,170 --> 00:37:29,630
I'll be upset if he doesn't come.'

567
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:33,940
The party ended at around two o'clock the
next morning, but there was still no sign

568
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:36,470
of Aron.

569
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:42,090
The first person to think something might
be wrong was Aron's boss, Brion.

570
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:47,250
Early Tuesday morning, he called the house
and spoke to Leona.

571
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:51,430
'He didn't come to the party last night,'
Leona told him.

572
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:54,890
'I thought he'd driven straight to work.'

573
00:37:54,890 --> 00:37:59,290
'No, he's not here, and Aron's never late.

574
00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:01,260
I think something might be wrong.

575
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:05,110
Could you call me right away if he gets back?'

576
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:10,550
'Yes, sure,' said Leona, feeling a little
worried.

577
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:15,290
She called Brion later that afternoon to ask
if Aron had arrived.

578
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:17,360
'No,' said Brion.

579
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:21,470
'Did he say where he was going?'

580
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:24,870
'He didn't say much to any of us.

581
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:28,190
Only that he was going climbing and biking.

582
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:31,100
He also said he might hike in Utah.

583
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:33,350
Somewhere in Canyonlands.

584
00:38:33,350 --> 00:38:37,220
He didn't say where, exactly.'

585
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:41,490
'Mmm, that's a big area,' said Brion.

586
00:38:41,490 --> 00:38:44,310
'I'll wait until nine o'clock tomorrow morning.

587
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:49,860
If he's not back by then, I'll call his parents.'

588
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:53,620
Aron's housemates decided not to wait any
longer.

589
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:57,460
At six-thirty that evening, they called the
police.

590
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:05,270
The officer on the desk asked for Aron's information:
full name, age, height and weight.

591
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:09,720
He also wanted to know the model of his truck
and the license-plate number.

592
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:14,910
But there was something the officer didn't
tell them: a person has to be missing for

593
00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:20,760
at least forty-eight hours before the police
will start a search and rescue operation.

594
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:26,120
This meant that they wouldn't do anything
until late the following day.

595
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:30,020
63 Mrs 15 mins

596
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:36,410
12.00 am It's my third night here and I've
decided to take my first sip of urine.

597
00:39:36,410 --> 00:39:42,030
There's still half a cup of water left, but
I want to save it.

598
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:46,900
The urine tastes bad, but not quite as bad
as I thought.

599
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:51,640
I decide not to drink any more until the water
is finished.

600
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:56,430
I've changed my drinking routine because the
night is colder.

601
00:39:56,430 --> 00:40:01,950
I can now only sit for a few minutes so I
take smaller sips every hour.

602
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:05,550
66 hrs 15 mins

603
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:11,140
3.00 am It's now sixty hours since my accident.

604
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:15,580
That's sixty hours of pain, no sleep, and
very little water.

605
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:21,020
Two hours later, it's time for my next sip
of water.

606
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:25,150
I put the bottle between my legs and turn
the top.

607
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:28,540
When it's open, I try and lift it towards
my mouth.

608
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:33,510
But it hits my harness and falls back onto
my legs.

609
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:37,040
I am too tired to catch it.

610
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:40,680
Some of the valuable water falls onto my shorts.

611
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,050
'Damn!

612
00:40:42,050 --> 00:40:43,420
Damn!

613
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:44,790
Damn!'

614
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:47,540
I shout.

615
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:49,730
Now look what you've done!

616
00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:52,180
Says the first voice.

617
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:55,170
I know exactly what I've done.

618
00:40:55,170 --> 00:40:57,940
I've just lost half of the rest of my life.

619
00:40:57,940 --> 00:40:59,210
70 hrs

620
00:40:59,210 --> 00:41:07,720
6.45 am As morning arrives once more, I feel
a little hope.

621
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:11,730
At least I've survived another night.

622
00:41:11,730 --> 00:41:18,330
It's now Tuesday, April the 29th: my fourth
day trapped in the canyon.

623
00:41:18,330 --> 00:41:21,520
I decide to film earlier today.

624
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:26,740
I put the camcorder on the boulder, then turn
the screen the other way.

625
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:30,190
I don't want to look at myself as I speak.

626
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:31,320
'Hi.

627
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:34,700
It's Tuesday morning.

628
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:40,950
I guess everyone missed me when I didn't arrive
for Leona's party last night.

629
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:44,250
Most people will probably think I'm still
travelling.

630
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:47,010
Except for Brion.

631
00:41:47,010 --> 00:41:51,350
When I don't arrive for work, he'll think
something is wrong.

632
00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:54,540
He might call the police and report me missing.

633
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:58,250
They'll wait forty-eight hours before searching.

634
00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:03,170
If I'm lucky, they'll start some time on Wednesday.

635
00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:07,880
If I'm very lucky, they might search the Robbers
Roost area first.

636
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:12,730
Even then, the earliest they'll reach me is
Thursday.

637
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:18,520
I'll try to stay alive as long as I can, but
I can't imagine living longer than one more

638
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:19,520
day.

639
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:22,440
This means help will arrive too late.

640
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:25,640
By Thursday, I'll be dead.

641
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:29,840
And this video will be history.'

642
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:32,400
CHAPTER EIGHT
The raven

643
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:37,140
70 hrs 45 mins

644
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:43,280
7.30 am That last video recording was the
most pessimistic so far.

645
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:48,510
It's strange, but the feeling of hopelessness
doesn't last.

646
00:42:48,510 --> 00:42:52,540
As the sky grows brighter, I think of the
raven.

647
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:55,490
The bird is a sign of hope.

648
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:59,570
Just thinking about it makes me want to do
something.

649
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:02,100
I try lifting the boulder once more.

650
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:08,290
I make the rope even shorter, but when I step
on it, nothing happens.

651
00:43:08,290 --> 00:43:11,870
I do everything I can to make it work.

652
00:43:11,870 --> 00:43:16,170
I push, jump and shout as I put all my weight
onto the rope.

653
00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:18,970
It's still no good.

654
00:43:18,970 --> 00:43:22,420
The boulder doesn't move a millimetre.

655
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:25,990
I step down and lay my head on the boulder.

656
00:43:25,990 --> 00:43:28,710
I feel like crying but I can't.

657
00:43:28,710 --> 00:43:33,290
There's not enough water in my body to produce
any tears.

658
00:43:33,290 --> 00:43:35,760
But there's still the knife.

659
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:39,580
It's lying open on top of the boulder.

660
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:43,190
Suddenly, I know what I'm going to do.

661
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:47,840
Quickly, I put the tourniquet around my arm
and tighten it.

662
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:54,300
Then I pick up the multi-tool, open the shorter
knife and push it hard into my arm.

663
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:59,050
This time, the knife goes all the way in.

664
00:43:59,050 --> 00:44:04,330
I pull out the knife and look at the deep
hole I've made in my right arm.

665
00:44:04,330 --> 00:44:06,470
I can't believe I've done this.

666
00:44:06,470 --> 00:44:11,119
It didn't even hurt and there's very little
blood.

667
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:14,840
I can see the bones in my arm through the
hole.

668
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:19,000
I will never be able to cut through them with
only a small knife.

669
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,470
It's time for a drink.

670
00:44:22,470 --> 00:44:27,810
I pick up the bottle and feel the last of
the water disappear down my throat.

671
00:44:27,810 --> 00:44:30,100
I check the time.

672
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:35,540
It's exactly 8.00 am and all I have to drink
now is urine.

673
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:39,620
71 hrs 45 mins

674
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:42,440
8.30 am The raven appears.

675
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:46,590
It's fifteen minutes late but I'm happy.

676
00:44:46,590 --> 00:44:49,619
I was beginning to think it wouldn't come.

677
00:44:49,619 --> 00:44:54,760
I feel happy and start thinking of all the
wonderful times I've spent with friends and

678
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:55,840
family.

679
00:44:55,840 --> 00:45:01,590
I remember a trip to Washington D.C. with
my sister, and another to Gettysburg with

680
00:45:01,590 --> 00:45:03,360
my dad.

681
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:07,890
I also think of all the adventures I've had
with different friends.

682
00:45:07,890 --> 00:45:13,170
The time passes quickly Midday arrives without
me realising.

683
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:16,970
I urinate into the CamelBak.

684
00:45:16,970 --> 00:45:21,390
Then I pour the clearer half of the urine
into my water bottle.

685
00:45:21,390 --> 00:45:23,880
I throw the rest away.

686
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:28,820
I have no idea how long anyone can survive
on urine alone.

687
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:32,770
At least drinking it wasn't as bad as I expected.

688
00:45:32,770 --> 00:45:36,260
It is now the warmest part of the day.

689
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:40,550
This is the time I am most comfortable.

690
00:45:40,550 --> 00:45:45,130
I have found the best way to sit and feel
calmer in the warm air.

691
00:45:45,130 --> 00:45:48,110
Perhaps help will arrive in time.

692
00:45:48,110 --> 00:45:53,350
If so, I will soon be as free as the raven.

693
00:45:53,350 --> 00:45:58,590
Three hours later, I have reached the end
of my third day trapped in the canyon.

694
00:45:58,590 --> 00:46:02,700
None of my plans of escape have worked.

695
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:08,080
All I can do is stay strong for another night
and hope for rescue.

696
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:09,730
I eat the last burrito.

697
00:46:09,730 --> 00:46:15,580
It is too dry to get down my throat so I take
a mouthful of urine.

698
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:21,770
The urine tastes better at night because it's
colder, but it's still going to be a long,

699
00:46:21,770 --> 00:46:23,030
hard night.

700
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:27,830
On Wednesday morning, Brion After was at work
in the shop.

701
00:46:27,830 --> 00:46:33,020
At nine-fifteen, he called Leona to check
if he had arrived, but he hadn't.

702
00:46:33,020 --> 00:46:36,700
Brion had waited long enough.

703
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:38,990
He picked up the phone.

704
00:46:38,990 --> 00:46:41,920
Aron's mother answered on the first ring.

705
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:43,800
'Mrs Ralston?'

706
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:44,800
'Yes?'

707
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:50,820
'This is Brion After - Aron's boss at Ute
Mountaineer.

708
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:54,180
I'm afraid I'm rather worried about him.

709
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:58,150
He hasn't returned from a trip he took last
week.

710
00:46:58,150 --> 00:47:00,720
Do you know where he went?

711
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:04,350
No one here has seen him since last Wednesday.'

712
00:47:04,350 --> 00:47:07,520
'Oh dear,' said Aron's mother.

713
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:10,690
'I have no idea where he is.

714
00:47:10,690 --> 00:47:15,580
I called him last week and left a message,
but he didn't call back.

715
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:20,230
Did he tell any of his housemates where he
was going?'

716
00:47:20,230 --> 00:47:26,930
'No, just that he might hike somewhere in
the Canyonlands area of Utah,' explained Brion

717
00:47:26,930 --> 00:47:30,810
'I think you should call the Aspen police.'

718
00:47:30,810 --> 00:47:33,640
'Yes, I'll do that right now.

719
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:36,530
I'll let you know what happens.'

720
00:47:36,530 --> 00:47:39,420
'Thank you, Brion.'

721
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:44,490
Mrs Ralston's hand was shaking as she put
down the phone.

722
00:47:44,490 --> 00:47:46,680
She suddenly had an idea.

723
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:53,540
Perhaps Aron had sent an email to one of his
friends saying where he was going?

724
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:56,150
She went to the computer.

725
00:47:56,150 --> 00:47:59,760
Aron had an email address - but what was it?

726
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:04,950
She found his name, but had to answer a secret
question to read his emails.

727
00:48:04,950 --> 00:48:09,000
None of the answers she gave worked but she
kept trying.

728
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:16,630
In the end, she guessed the correct answer
and sent the information to Brion.

729
00:48:16,630 --> 00:48:23,290
After Brion had called the Aspen police, the
head officer, Adam Crider, started the rescue

730
00:48:23,290 --> 00:48:24,480
operation.

731
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:29,220
He called Mrs Ralston for the license-plate
number of her son's truck.

732
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:33,930
Mrs Ralston had written it down on a piece
of paper.

733
00:48:33,930 --> 00:48:39,130
When she read it to Officer Crider, she didn't
realise it was wrong.

734
00:48:39,130 --> 00:48:44,040
Aron had given it to her in a hurry and made
a mistake.

735
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:49,930
Officer Crider called back and told Mrs Ralston
there was no record of that license plate.

736
00:48:49,930 --> 00:48:53,560
This left her with another problem.

737
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:56,670
How could she find the correct license-plate
number?

738
00:48:56,670 --> 00:49:00,820
Brion After was having better luck.

739
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:05,490
He had found a list of email addresses for
Aron's climbing friends.

740
00:49:05,490 --> 00:49:08,940
Perhaps they knew where he was.

741
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:14,280
He wanted to check immediately, but he had
to leave for Australia that day.

742
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:20,140
He called Aron's housemate Elliot and asked
him to manage the store and rescue operation

743
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:22,510
until he returned.

744
00:49:22,510 --> 00:49:24,910
Elliot agreed.

745
00:49:24,910 --> 00:49:30,200
When Elliot reached the store, he received
a call from Mrs Ralston.

746
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:33,980
She wanted to check the license-plate number
she had given Brion.

747
00:49:33,980 --> 00:49:36,690
It was on his desk.

748
00:49:36,690 --> 00:49:39,790
Elliot checked as she read out the number.

749
00:49:39,790 --> 00:49:40,790
'Wait.

750
00:49:40,790 --> 00:49:45,940
Did you say 886, Mrs Ralston?'

751
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:46,940
'Yes.'

752
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:50,720
'Brion made a mistake.

753
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:54,470
He wrote down 888.

754
00:49:54,470 --> 00:49:57,960
I'll call Officer Crider and give him the
correct number.'

755
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:04,920
By early afternoon, Elliot had received an
email from Steve Pratchett, the most important

756
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:07,940
of Aron's climbing friends.

757
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:11,050
Steve had climbed for many years.

758
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:16,170
He often led rescue operations to find climbers
lost in the mountains.

759
00:50:16,170 --> 00:50:22,650
Another friend, Jason, had sent Steve a list
of all the canyons Aron said he wanted to

760
00:50:22,650 --> 00:50:25,400
hike in Canyonlands.

761
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:32,350
Steve called the Utah police for the area
and spoke to one the main officers, Kyle Ekker.

762
00:50:32,350 --> 00:50:35,310
Officer Ekker was very helpful.

763
00:50:35,310 --> 00:50:40,430
Steve gave him the latest license-plate number
for Aron's truck and Officer Ekker sent his

764
00:50:40,430 --> 00:50:43,670
men out to look for it.

765
00:50:43,670 --> 00:50:46,580
They returned as night fell.

766
00:50:46,580 --> 00:50:49,560
There was no sign of the truck.

767
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:54,010
Officer Ekker checked the number with the
national license office.

768
00:50:54,010 --> 00:50:57,100
There was no vehicle on record.

769
00:50:57,100 --> 00:50:59,470
Once again, the number was wrong.

770
00:50:59,470 --> 00:51:03,070
The bad news reached Aron's mother.

771
00:51:03,070 --> 00:51:08,960
Then she remembered that Aron was living in
Albuquerque, New Mexico, when he bought the

772
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:09,960
truck.

773
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:15,270
The vehicle license office for the area was
in Santa Fe.

774
00:51:15,270 --> 00:51:20,340
She called and an officer searched the records
and found Aron's name.

775
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:27,240
The records showed his license-plate number
as NM 846-MMY.

776
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:31,520
Finally, they had the correct number.

777
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:33,730
The information was given to Officer Ekker.

778
00:51:33,730 --> 00:51:38,030
It was too late to continue searching that
night.

779
00:51:38,030 --> 00:51:41,060
It would have to wait until the morning.

780
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:46,970
'Wait for us, Aron,' Mrs Ralston said as she
went to bed.

781
00:51:46,970 --> 00:51:48,920
'We're coming.'

782
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:52,810
89 hrs 15 mins

783
00:51:52,810 --> 00:51:55,980
2.00 am The darkness seems unreal.

784
00:51:55,980 --> 00:52:01,710
In fact, I don't know what is real and what
isn't anymore.

785
00:52:01,710 --> 00:52:04,740
I start to have visions.

786
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:10,450
Friends suddenly appear in the canyon like
silent ghosts and wave me towards them.

787
00:52:10,450 --> 00:52:15,600
I follow and find myself in some place I know
from the past.

788
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:19,150
They smile at me in a kind way, but they never
speak.

789
00:52:19,150 --> 00:52:23,720
Because of their kindness, I am not afraid.

790
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:25,830
I know they are protecting me.

791
00:52:25,830 --> 00:52:29,590
I am happy while the visions last.

792
00:52:29,590 --> 00:52:31,620
To me, they are real.

793
00:52:31,620 --> 00:52:38,350
It is only when they disappear and the cold
and pain return that I know they are not.

794
00:52:38,350 --> 00:52:43,390
Then, shaking hard, I continue chipping at
the boulder.

795
00:52:43,390 --> 00:52:48,250
After that, I sit again and it's not long
before the visions return.

796
00:52:48,250 --> 00:52:55,840
During the second half of the night, I have
visions of myself as a child.

797
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:59,580
Sometimes I'm playing cards with my grandfather.

798
00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:05,530
Other times I am running across bright green
fields with my friends.

799
00:53:05,530 --> 00:53:09,980
Something about the visions tells me that
I have not given the people I care about enough

800
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:11,770
attention.

801
00:53:11,770 --> 00:53:17,760
I'm always thinking of the things I want to
achieve and not noticing other people.

802
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:23,640
Now I realise that my love for friends and
family is the main reason I want to escape.

803
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:27,980
The thought of seeing them again is keeping
me alive.

804
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:33,050
I promise myself that if I can escape from
here back to the people, I will be kinder

805
00:53:33,050 --> 00:53:34,490
towards them.

806
00:53:34,490 --> 00:53:38,570
The visions always include some kind of drink.

807
00:53:38,570 --> 00:53:44,740
It is usually something cold and sweet like
apple juice or ice tea.

808
00:53:44,740 --> 00:53:50,180
Just as I am about to drink, the vision disappears
and I wake up.

809
00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:54,800
Then I feel the cold and the pain of the rope
against my legs.

810
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:59,340
I stand up and begin my routine all over again.

811
00:53:59,340 --> 00:54:04,940
However, the visions tell me something: I
am not ready to die.

812
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:11,430
As morning comes on the fifth day, I feel
sure I can still last a few more days.

813
00:54:11,430 --> 00:54:17,140
I don't know if this is true, but I'm still
alive when the sun rises.

814
00:54:17,140 --> 00:54:19,450
The raven appears on time.

815
00:54:19,450 --> 00:54:24,200
The sound of its wings and the light in the
canyon are beautiful.

816
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:28,810
I watch its smooth flight, following the line
of the canyon.

817
00:54:28,810 --> 00:54:33,950
I take out my camera and film as it disappears
from view.

818
00:54:33,950 --> 00:54:36,430
CHAPTER NINE
'It's his truck'

819
00:54:36,430 --> 00:54:41,260
97 hrs 45 mins

820
00:54:41,260 --> 00:54:46,160
10.30 am I don't want to look at my watch.

821
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:51,040
When I did this last night, the time seemed
to pass more slowly.

822
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:52,610
I have a new idea.

823
00:54:52,610 --> 00:54:57,880
It came to me, as I was looking at all the
rocks around me.

824
00:54:57,880 --> 00:55:02,700
Why not find a hard rock and use it to break
the boulder?

825
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:05,660
There's one in a hole in the canyon wall above
me.

826
00:55:05,660 --> 00:55:08,530
It is round and black.

827
00:55:08,530 --> 00:55:10,960
I reach up and pull it out.

828
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:14,700
It's perfect - just the right size and weight.

829
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:18,540
I hit the rock hard against the boulder.

830
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:22,250
Little bits of stone fly into the air.

831
00:55:22,250 --> 00:55:24,440
It's working.

832
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:29,980
I continue, but soon have to stop because
of the pain in my left hand.

833
00:55:29,980 --> 00:55:33,680
I decide to rest for a while.

834
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:37,099
Early afternoon is usually the warmest time
of day.

835
00:55:37,099 --> 00:55:42,710
But today it's only thirteen degrees, the
coldest day so far.

836
00:55:42,710 --> 00:55:47,730
It also means that tonight will be the coldest
night.

837
00:55:47,730 --> 00:55:52,050
Realising this makes me want to do something
while it's still light.

838
00:55:52,050 --> 00:55:57,760
The problem with using the black rock was
that it hurt my left hand.

839
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:01,270
But what if I tie a sock around my hand to
protect it?

840
00:56:01,270 --> 00:56:04,390
I do this and it works.

841
00:56:04,390 --> 00:56:11,300
By 6.00 pm, I have taken off more of the boulder
in three hours than I did in four days.

842
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:13,280
But it's still not enough.

843
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:19,930
And even with the sock there is too much pain
in my left hand to continue.

844
00:56:19,930 --> 00:56:22,200
I put down the rock.

845
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:26,710
I feel sure I won't survive another night
in the canyon.

846
00:56:26,710 --> 00:56:28,500
I finally accept this.

847
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:32,650
There is nothing else I can do to save myself.

848
00:56:32,650 --> 00:56:37,210
110 hrs 15 mins

849
00:56:37,210 --> 00:56:40,721
11.00 pm The canyon feels as cold as ice.

850
00:56:40,721 --> 00:56:45,740
I have been awake for over a hundred hours.

851
00:56:45,740 --> 00:56:50,040
Another night of the sitting - standing routine
will kill me.

852
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:56,420
I haven't had any clean water since eight
o'clock yesterday morning, only urine.

853
00:56:56,420 --> 00:56:58,900
How much longer can I survive?

854
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:01,480
Death could come at any moment.

855
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:07,550
I am so certain of this that I take the knife
and write the dates of my life on the canyon

856
00:57:07,550 --> 00:57:08,550
wall.

857
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:17,210
When I have finished I read them by the light
of my headlamp: ARON OCT 75 - APR 03.

858
00:57:17,210 --> 00:57:20,060
Around midnight, I have another vision.

859
00:57:20,060 --> 00:57:24,010
I am walking alone through the canyon wall.

860
00:57:24,010 --> 00:57:27,080
On the other side is a living room.

861
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:29,690
I step inside and look around.

862
00:57:29,690 --> 00:57:34,210
A little boy in a red shirt comes into the
room.

863
00:57:34,210 --> 00:57:36,859
I guess he must be about three.

864
00:57:36,859 --> 00:57:40,620
Suddenly, I know who he is.

865
00:57:40,620 --> 00:57:44,340
He is my future son and the room is in my
future home.

866
00:57:44,340 --> 00:57:49,080
The little boy runs across the wooden floor,
laughing.

867
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:52,220
I pick him up with my left arm.

868
00:57:52,220 --> 00:57:55,260
My right arm has no hand.

869
00:57:55,260 --> 00:57:59,720
Then I put him onto my shoulder and he laughs
even more.

870
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:04,700
He holds my arms in his little hands and together
we dance around the room.

871
00:58:04,700 --> 00:58:09,609
The sun is shining and I feel free, happy,
and alive.

872
00:58:09,609 --> 00:58:12,450
The vision disappears.

873
00:58:12,450 --> 00:58:18,900
I am back in the canyon again, but now I don't
feel the same as before.

874
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:21,570
Seeing the boy has changed everything.

875
00:58:21,570 --> 00:58:29,450
Now, even with the cold, pain, tiredness and
thirst, I am sure I will survive.

876
00:58:29,450 --> 00:58:35,970
On Thursday, May the 1st, Kyle Ekker was looking
at a map of the Canyonlands area on his office

877
00:58:35,970 --> 00:58:36,970
wall.

878
00:58:36,970 --> 00:58:41,480
The clock above read 9.07 am.

879
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:48,270
Already that morning, his men had searched
the top and centre of the area and found nothing.

880
00:58:48,270 --> 00:58:51,780
What about the Robbers Roost canyons in the
south?

881
00:58:51,780 --> 00:58:55,690
The only roads down there were made of rocks
and sand.

882
00:58:55,690 --> 00:58:59,320
It might take longer to search.

883
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:02,800
He called Glen Sherrill, the head officer
for the area.

884
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:07,820
When Glen answered the phone, Kyle described
Aron's truck.

885
00:59:07,820 --> 00:59:11,580
'It's a red Toyota.

886
00:59:11,580 --> 00:59:14,920
License number NM 846-MMY.'

887
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:20,520
'I think I've seen a truck like that,' Glen
replied.

888
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:24,020
'I'll radio one of my men and ask them to
check.'

889
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:28,560
Kyle thanked him and put down the phone.

890
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:31,550
Twenty minutes later, Glen called back.

891
00:59:31,550 --> 00:59:33,780
'Officer Kyle?'

892
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:34,900
'Speaking.'

893
00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:38,230
'Glen Sherrill here.

894
00:59:38,230 --> 00:59:40,580
We've found the truck you're looking for.

895
00:59:40,580 --> 00:59:44,830
It's in the Horseshoe Canyon carpark.'

896
00:59:44,830 --> 00:59:51,660
By 10.00 am, the good news had reached Elliot,
Steve, and Mrs Ralston.

897
00:59:51,660 --> 00:59:58,160
Steve immediately arranged for a rescue team
to join the police and help in the search.

898
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:00,609
Half an hour later, they were on their way.

899
01:00:00,609 --> 01:00:05,119
Things were now moving fast.

900
01:00:05,119 --> 01:00:07,700
CHAPTER TEN
Escape

901
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:11,560
120 hrs

902
01:00:11,560 --> 01:00:16,340
8.45 am It's Thursday, May the 1st.

903
01:00:16,340 --> 01:00:19,710
120 hours without sleep.

904
01:00:19,710 --> 01:00:22,260
Two days without water.

905
01:00:22,260 --> 01:00:25,760
I can't believe I'm still alive.

906
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:28,680
I didn't think I'd survive beyond Wednesday.

907
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:33,940
Perhaps the vision of the little boy kept
me alive last night.

908
01:00:33,940 --> 01:00:39,270
But now, with no sign of a rescue, my hopes
are disappearing fast.

909
01:00:39,270 --> 01:00:44,410
I am also upset because the raven hasn't appeared.

910
01:00:44,410 --> 01:00:47,140
It's never been this late before.

911
01:00:47,140 --> 01:00:50,890
I try and forget about the bird and pick up
the camcorder.

912
01:00:50,890 --> 01:00:55,130
I am certain that this will be my last message
to my family.

913
01:00:55,130 --> 01:01:01,940
I am calm as I leave necessary instructions
for my parents.

914
01:01:01,940 --> 01:01:05,890
I tell them to give most of my things to Sonja.

915
01:01:05,890 --> 01:01:09,000
Then I tell them what to do with my dead body.

916
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:14,720
The video ends with three simple words: 'I
love you.'

917
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:18,010
I'm crying as I close the camcorder for the
last time.

918
01:01:18,010 --> 01:01:23,960
But there are no tears - my body is too dry
for tears.

919
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:26,390
Now I can only wait.

920
01:01:26,390 --> 01:01:28,680
I can't accept this.

921
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:32,099
I've discovered that nothing I can do will
help me escape.

922
01:01:32,099 --> 01:01:36,250
But it's better to be doing something than
nothing.

923
01:01:36,250 --> 01:01:41,140
I pick up the black rock and hit it as hard
as I can against the boulder.

924
01:01:41,140 --> 01:01:45,410
I continue, trying to forget the pain in my
left hand.

925
01:01:45,410 --> 01:01:48,490
In the end, I can't.

926
01:01:48,490 --> 01:01:53,880
I try to drop the rock, but the fingers of
my hand won't open.

927
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:58,740
What have you done now? asks the first voice.

928
01:01:58,740 --> 01:02:01,180
Stay calm, says the second.

929
01:02:01,180 --> 01:02:06,470
Slowly, my fingers loosen and the stone falls
out of my hand.

930
01:02:06,470 --> 01:02:09,240
I look at my other arm.

931
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:12,390
It's covered with bits of rock.

932
01:02:12,390 --> 01:02:17,510
As I'm removing these with the knife I push
too hard and the blade goes through the skin

933
01:02:17,510 --> 01:02:19,540
near my wrist.

934
01:02:19,540 --> 01:02:22,260
I don't feel anything.

935
01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:25,290
That part of my arm must be dead.

936
01:02:25,290 --> 01:02:28,450
My right hand died long ago.

937
01:02:28,450 --> 01:02:31,040
It's now a dark blue colour.

938
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:33,890
I push the knife through the skin of my thumb.

939
01:02:33,890 --> 01:02:39,390
There's a sound as some gas escapes, followed
by a bad smell.

940
01:02:39,390 --> 01:02:43,770
The arm is poisoned and the poison will kill
me.

941
01:02:43,770 --> 01:02:47,660
I don't want the arm to be a part of me anymore.

942
01:02:47,660 --> 01:02:50,890
I throw myself against the boulder.

943
01:02:50,890 --> 01:02:54,930
When I look at my arm, I see that it's in
a strange position.

944
01:02:54,930 --> 01:02:59,300
That moment is like the sun coming out.

945
01:02:59,300 --> 01:03:01,850
I realise what it means.

946
01:03:01,850 --> 01:03:05,510
I can break my arm by using my own weight.

947
01:03:05,510 --> 01:03:09,690
That means I won't have to cut through bone
anymore.

948
01:03:09,690 --> 01:03:13,820
I throw the whole weight of my body below
the boulder.

949
01:03:13,820 --> 01:03:16,130
There is a loud noise.

950
01:03:16,130 --> 01:03:17,160
I keep going.

951
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:21,020
There is a second loud noise.

952
01:03:21,020 --> 01:03:22,750
I've done it!

953
01:03:22,750 --> 01:03:26,390
I've broken both bones in my arm.

954
01:03:26,390 --> 01:03:30,420
I tie the tourniquet, take the knife and begin
cutting.

955
01:03:30,420 --> 01:03:35,650
The only thing on my mind is escape, but the
pain is terrible.

956
01:03:35,650 --> 01:03:38,910
I scream as I push down with the knife.

957
01:03:38,910 --> 01:03:44,440
For almost one hour the pain, screams, and
cutting continue.

958
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:48,800
122 hrs 47 mins

959
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:56,060
11.32 am Finally, I feel the knife hit rock
on the other side of my arm.

960
01:03:56,060 --> 01:04:00,380
I fall back with a single thought screaming
through my head.

961
01:04:00,380 --> 01:04:03,590
You've done it, Aron!

962
01:04:03,590 --> 01:04:05,660
You're FREE!

963
01:04:05,660 --> 01:04:06,700
FREE!

964
01:04:06,700 --> 01:04:07,740
FREE!

965
01:04:07,740 --> 01:04:10,390
There's no time to lose.

966
01:04:10,390 --> 01:04:17,070
Blood is coming out of the end of my arm and
it's a long walk back to my truck.

967
01:04:17,070 --> 01:04:19,740
I tighten the tourniquet.

968
01:04:19,740 --> 01:04:23,880
Then I tie my climbing bag on my arm to hold
it.

969
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:27,750
I tighten it around my neck and put my things
inside.

970
01:04:27,750 --> 01:04:34,890
Before I leave, I take two pictures of the
part of my arm still trapped by the boulder.

971
01:04:34,890 --> 01:04:37,780
Now I am ready to go.

972
01:04:37,780 --> 01:04:40,250
I can't walk straight.

973
01:04:40,250 --> 01:04:44,910
My body crashes from one side of the canyon
wall to the other.

974
01:04:44,910 --> 01:04:46,000
I stop.

975
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:49,970
My heart is going much too fast.

976
01:04:49,970 --> 01:04:53,120
I could still die at any moment.

977
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:56,220
I make myself stay calm.

978
01:04:56,220 --> 01:04:59,440
What I need most of all is water.

979
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:04,190
There might be some at the Big Drop Rappel,
but first I need to get there.

980
01:05:04,190 --> 01:05:07,420
It takes me twenty minutes.

981
01:05:07,420 --> 01:05:09,830
I stand at the edge and look down.

982
01:05:09,830 --> 01:05:15,440
It is just over eighteen metres to the canyon
floor.

983
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:18,849
There are metal rings in the rock for climbers.

984
01:05:18,849 --> 01:05:21,990
I tie my rope to them and rappel down.

985
01:05:21,990 --> 01:05:25,500
With only one arm, this is not easy.

986
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:30,090
For once, I am careful as I go down the rope.

987
01:05:30,090 --> 01:05:32,700
I reach the bottom and turn.

988
01:05:32,700 --> 01:05:36,920
On the ground in front of me is a pool of
brown water.

989
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:41,380
It's full of dead mosquitoes but I don't care.

990
01:05:41,380 --> 01:05:45,530
I fill my bottle and drink one litre in a
few seconds.

991
01:05:45,530 --> 01:05:49,640
I drink another and don't want to move.

992
01:05:49,640 --> 01:05:52,790
I just want to stay there for the rest of
my life.

993
01:05:52,790 --> 01:05:57,300
That won't be long if you don't start walking.

994
01:05:57,300 --> 01:06:01,950
There are still twelve kilometres to go.

995
01:06:01,950 --> 01:06:04,210
The voice is right.

996
01:06:04,210 --> 01:06:08,400
I drink one more litre, slowly this time.

997
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:11,910
Then I fill my bottle and the CamelBak and
begin walking.

998
01:06:11,910 --> 01:06:16,460
Blood is coming out faster from my arm now.

999
01:06:16,460 --> 01:06:21,060
I wonder if I can get back to the truck in
time.

1000
01:06:21,060 --> 01:06:22,810
Things start to go wrong.

1001
01:06:22,810 --> 01:06:28,089
I get lost up a side canyon and have to turn
round.

1002
01:06:28,089 --> 01:06:32,480
Then I notice that water is coming out of
my CamelBak.

1003
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:34,200
There's a hole in it.

1004
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:38,010
Quickly, I drink the rest of the water.

1005
01:06:38,010 --> 01:06:41,740
Now I only have the water in the water bottle.

1006
01:06:41,740 --> 01:06:46,520
This has to last all the way back to the truck
and the temperature is rising.

1007
01:06:46,520 --> 01:06:51,950
I am so weak and tired I can't imagine surviving
that long.

1008
01:06:51,950 --> 01:06:56,570
I take a sip and keep the water in my mouth
as I walk.

1009
01:06:56,570 --> 01:06:58,500
That seems to help.

1010
01:06:58,500 --> 01:07:03,000
I still wonder if I can get back to my truck.

1011
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:09,780
I can't walk straight, I can't think for more
than a few seconds, and I'm losing blood,

1012
01:07:09,780 --> 01:07:10,880
fast.

1013
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:15,300
125 hrs 10 mins

1014
01:07:15,300 --> 01:07:19,180
1.55 pm I've arrived at the Great Gallery.

1015
01:07:19,180 --> 01:07:24,020
The paintings are amazing but all I can think
of is water.

1016
01:07:24,020 --> 01:07:27,010
There is more here.

1017
01:07:27,010 --> 01:07:29,300
I stop to fill the water bottle.

1018
01:07:29,300 --> 01:07:35,470
It has taken me two and a half hours to travel
six kilometres.

1019
01:07:35,470 --> 01:07:38,570
For someone close to death I have done well.

1020
01:07:38,570 --> 01:07:42,340
But my problems are getting worse every minute.

1021
01:07:42,340 --> 01:07:49,530
Blood is now coming from my arm really fast
and I'm in terrible pain from the amputation.

1022
01:07:49,530 --> 01:07:52,930
I want to stop and rest, but I can't.

1023
01:07:52,930 --> 01:07:55,450
I must go on.

1024
01:07:55,450 --> 01:07:57,690
I walk as fast as I can.

1025
01:07:57,690 --> 01:08:03,369
By two-thirty, I have covered nearly ten kilometres.

1026
01:08:03,369 --> 01:08:08,730
Only three more kilometres to my truck, but
I'm feeling weaker every minute.

1027
01:08:08,730 --> 01:08:13,369
125 hrs 45 mins

1028
01:08:13,369 --> 01:08:18,290
2.30 pm I've come to another huge canyon.

1029
01:08:18,290 --> 01:08:21,739
The walls must be over thirty metres high.

1030
01:08:21,739 --> 01:08:24,270
Ahead of me is a steep hill.

1031
01:08:24,270 --> 01:08:26,839
This is bad news.

1032
01:08:26,839 --> 01:08:31,319
I'll never be able to climb it - I'm too weak.

1033
01:08:31,319 --> 01:08:33,210
Something makes me look again.

1034
01:08:33,210 --> 01:08:37,580
I shake my head, unable to believe what I
see.

1035
01:08:37,580 --> 01:08:43,810
About seventy metres ahead of me are a family
of three people - a man, a woman and a young

1036
01:08:43,810 --> 01:08:44,810
boy.

1037
01:08:44,810 --> 01:08:47,989
They are walking away from me.

1038
01:08:47,989 --> 01:08:49,339
'HELP!

1039
01:08:49,339 --> 01:08:50,690
HELP!

1040
01:08:50,690 --> 01:08:52,040
PLEASE!

1041
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:53,539
I NEED HELP!'

1042
01:08:53,539 --> 01:08:57,079
They turn and come running towards me.

1043
01:08:57,079 --> 01:09:04,270
When they reach me, I begin telling my story:
'My name is Aron Ralston.

1044
01:09:04,270 --> 01:09:08,909
I was trapped by a boulder in the canyon for
five days.

1045
01:09:08,909 --> 01:09:13,440
This morning, I had to amputate my arm to
escape.

1046
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:15,130
I need a doctor.

1047
01:09:15,130 --> 01:09:17,880
I'm losing blood, fast...'

1048
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:21,650
Unable to continue, I fall to the ground.

1049
01:09:21,650 --> 01:09:24,670
The man gives me a bottle of water.

1050
01:09:24,670 --> 01:09:30,420
'The police at the carpark told us about you,'
he says.

1051
01:09:30,420 --> 01:09:32,739
His name is Eric.

1052
01:09:32,739 --> 01:09:36,210
His wife is Monique and his son is called
Andy.

1053
01:09:36,210 --> 01:09:40,009
They are tourists from the Netherlands.

1054
01:09:40,009 --> 01:09:45,699
Eric gives me more water while Monique and
Andy run back to get the police.

1055
01:09:45,699 --> 01:09:51,029
After about ten minutes, Eric helps me up
and we continue walking slowly.

1056
01:09:51,029 --> 01:09:53,940
The steep trail is ahead.

1057
01:09:53,940 --> 01:09:58,699
Even with Eric's help, I know I won't be able
to climb it.

1058
01:09:58,699 --> 01:10:01,969
'How will I ever get out of here?'

1059
01:10:01,969 --> 01:10:04,370
I ask myself.

1060
01:10:04,370 --> 01:10:08,511
CHAPTER ELEVEN
127 hours

1061
01:10:08,511 --> 01:10:14,030
126 hrs 18 mins

1062
01:10:14,030 --> 01:10:19,949
3.03 pm A noise somewhere above me answers
the question.

1063
01:10:19,949 --> 01:10:21,239
It's a helicopter!

1064
01:10:21,239 --> 01:10:25,050
A helicopter to take me to hospital.

1065
01:10:25,050 --> 01:10:27,340
I can't believe it!

1066
01:10:27,340 --> 01:10:29,620
It doesn't seem real.

1067
01:10:29,620 --> 01:10:34,690
I sit down and wait as a man jumps to the
ground and walks towards me.

1068
01:10:34,690 --> 01:10:37,269
'Are you Aron Ralston?'

1069
01:10:37,269 --> 01:10:38,500
he asks.

1070
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:39,619
'Yes.'

1071
01:10:39,619 --> 01:10:45,840
A second man gets out of the helicopter and
they help me inside.

1072
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:49,949
I ask one of the men to get my climbing bag.

1073
01:10:49,949 --> 01:10:51,499
Eric gives it to him.

1074
01:10:51,499 --> 01:10:54,909
'Thank you, Eric,' I say.

1075
01:10:54,909 --> 01:10:57,610
'Thanks for everything.'

1076
01:10:57,610 --> 01:11:02,070
I wave goodbye as the helicopter rises into
the air.

1077
01:11:02,070 --> 01:11:07,329
I sit behind the pilot and watch blood pour
slowly down my arm.

1078
01:11:07,329 --> 01:11:10,369
Be strong, Aron.

1079
01:11:10,369 --> 01:11:11,949
You're almost safe.

1080
01:11:11,949 --> 01:11:15,579
'Keep him talking,' the pilot says to his
partner.

1081
01:11:15,579 --> 01:11:18,599
'Where are we going?'

1082
01:11:18,599 --> 01:11:20,709
I ask the second man.

1083
01:11:20,709 --> 01:11:25,190
'We're taking you to the hospital in Moab,'
he replies.

1084
01:11:25,190 --> 01:11:27,889
'How long will that take?'

1085
01:11:27,889 --> 01:11:31,869
'It's about twelve minutes from here.'

1086
01:11:31,869 --> 01:11:37,219
He asks me what happened in the canyon and
I begin telling my story.

1087
01:11:37,219 --> 01:11:41,750
By the time I finish, we are circling around
Moab.

1088
01:11:41,750 --> 01:11:45,690
I look down and see an area of green grass
below.

1089
01:11:45,690 --> 01:11:50,420
This gets bigger as we move down towards it.

1090
01:11:50,420 --> 01:11:53,209
I realise we are landing in front of the hospital.

1091
01:11:53,209 --> 01:11:59,820
A man who looks like a policeman is standing
with two nurses in white coats on the hospital

1092
01:11:59,820 --> 01:12:01,310
steps.

1093
01:12:01,310 --> 01:12:06,219
The helicopter lands and the nurses carry
me into the building.

1094
01:12:06,219 --> 01:12:08,199
They put me in an empty room.

1095
01:12:08,199 --> 01:12:12,040
The man walks in and introduces himself.

1096
01:12:12,040 --> 01:12:13,949
'Hi, Aron.

1097
01:12:13,949 --> 01:12:17,150
I'm Steve, and I'm a Park Ranger.'

1098
01:12:17,150 --> 01:12:25,510
As the nurses take off my shoes, I ask Steve
to let my mother know that I'm OK and to arrange

1099
01:12:25,510 --> 01:12:29,940
for someone to collect all the things I left
at Horseshoe Canyon.

1100
01:12:29,940 --> 01:12:35,380
'I'll do that when we've finished here,' Steve
replies.

1101
01:12:35,380 --> 01:12:39,020
He wants to know what happened in the canyon.

1102
01:12:39,020 --> 01:12:42,210
Once again, I tell my story.

1103
01:12:42,210 --> 01:12:45,330
It's the third time I've done this in two
hours.

1104
01:12:45,330 --> 01:12:52,340
When I finish, I can see that Steve wants
to ask me a lot of questions.

1105
01:12:52,340 --> 01:12:54,059
He doesn't get the chance.

1106
01:12:54,059 --> 01:12:59,790
A doctor comes back into the room with a large
needle.

1107
01:12:59,790 --> 01:13:00,790
'Wait!'

1108
01:13:00,790 --> 01:13:03,519
I say as she goes to put it into my skin.

1109
01:13:03,519 --> 01:13:07,199
'I have a problem with needles.

1110
01:13:07,199 --> 01:13:10,059
I sometimes go into shock.

1111
01:13:10,059 --> 01:13:12,619
I fell out of a chair once.'

1112
01:13:12,619 --> 01:13:14,769
The doctor looks surprised.

1113
01:13:14,769 --> 01:13:18,039
'You mean you're not in shock already?'

1114
01:13:18,039 --> 01:13:21,209
'I don't know,' I reply.

1115
01:13:21,209 --> 01:13:25,179
'Look, do you want this for the pain or not?'

1116
01:13:25,179 --> 01:13:27,510
'Damn it, yes!'

1117
01:13:27,510 --> 01:13:29,119
I say.

1118
01:13:29,119 --> 01:13:34,499
I continue talking to Steve as the needle
goes into my arm.

1119
01:13:34,499 --> 01:13:37,539
127 hrs

1120
01:13:37,539 --> 01:13:43,280
3.45 pm I suddenly hear another man's voice.

1121
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:45,690
He sounds like a doctor.

1122
01:13:45,690 --> 01:13:49,531
He pulls at the things over my right arm and
asks Steve what they are.

1123
01:13:49,531 --> 01:13:55,719
'There are a couple of tourniquets under there,'
Steve replies.

1124
01:13:55,719 --> 01:13:58,769
'No, just one,' I whisper.

1125
01:13:58,769 --> 01:14:02,510
I look at the clock on the wall.

1126
01:14:02,510 --> 01:14:06,760
It's 3.45 pm on Thursday, May the 1st.

1127
01:14:06,760 --> 01:14:14,409
I realise that my nightmare has lasted for
exactly 127 hours.

1128
01:14:14,409 --> 01:14:20,000
It's my last thought before falling into a
long, deep sleep.

1129
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:21,150
EPILOGUE

1130
01:14:21,150 --> 01:14:26,369
My rescue was only the first part of a long,
difficult fight back to health.

1131
01:14:26,369 --> 01:14:31,219
In that first month, I had five operations.

1132
01:14:31,219 --> 01:14:35,810
I was also taking eighteen different medicines
a day.

1133
01:14:35,810 --> 01:14:40,239
Most were for the pain and to fight the poison
in my blood.

1134
01:14:40,239 --> 01:14:43,829
While I was taking them, I couldn't do anything
well.

1135
01:14:43,829 --> 01:14:48,309
I couldn't sleep and my thoughts were unclear.

1136
01:14:48,309 --> 01:14:52,019
After ten days in hospital, I went home.

1137
01:14:52,019 --> 01:14:58,130
A week later, I was back in hospital in Denver
for my fifth and most difficult operation.

1138
01:14:58,130 --> 01:15:04,820
The time I woke up after the operation was
the lowest point after my escape.

1139
01:15:04,820 --> 01:15:06,489
I felt terrible.

1140
01:15:06,489 --> 01:15:11,739
I couldn't eat, I couldn't sleep and I was
still in pain.

1141
01:15:11,739 --> 01:15:15,699
Later, I discovered that I nearly died.

1142
01:15:15,699 --> 01:15:20,099
However by May the 25th, I was home to stay.

1143
01:15:20,099 --> 01:15:24,579
The following weeks were difficult for my
family.

1144
01:15:24,579 --> 01:15:29,190
I was like a child again, unable to do anything
for myself.

1145
01:15:29,190 --> 01:15:33,060
Slowly, however, things got better.

1146
01:15:33,060 --> 01:15:38,670
I was soon eating normal food and by the end
of the summer, I was the same weight as before

1147
01:15:38,670 --> 01:15:40,050
the accident.

1148
01:15:40,050 --> 01:15:43,100
By this time, I had a prosthetic arm.

1149
01:15:43,100 --> 01:15:47,349
I learnt to use it quite well.

1150
01:15:47,349 --> 01:15:49,010
I felt pleased.

1151
01:15:49,010 --> 01:15:53,869
It wouldn't be long before I would be able
to go climbing again.

1152
01:15:53,869 --> 01:15:58,400
Of course, I didn't tell my mother that.

1153
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:05,050
On August the 31st, four months after the
accident, I spoke at Sonja's wedding.

1154
01:16:05,050 --> 01:16:11,659
Four days later, I climbed Mount Moran in
Wyoming with eight of my friends.

1155
01:16:11,659 --> 01:16:19,329
On October the 25th - two days before my twenty-eighth
birthday - I returned to Blue John Canyon.

1156
01:16:19,329 --> 01:16:23,300
Some friends, including Kristi Moore, were
with me.

1157
01:16:23,300 --> 01:16:26,670
We filmed the place where the accident happened.

1158
01:16:26,670 --> 01:16:32,119
Then, as the others made their way back to
their vehicles, I stayed behind for a few

1159
01:16:32,119 --> 01:16:33,610
minutes.

1160
01:16:33,610 --> 01:16:39,270
Just before I left, I looked at the dates
of my life on the canyon wall.

1161
01:16:39,270 --> 01:16:41,289
I was wrong.

1162
01:16:41,289 --> 01:16:44,640
My life didn't end in the canyon.

1163
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:47,489
Thoughts of the people I love had kept me
alive.

1164
01:16:47,489 --> 01:16:52,949
If I wanted to see them again, I had to survive.

1165
01:16:52,949 --> 01:16:55,619
That's what I told myself.

1166
01:16:55,619 --> 01:16:57,480
And that's what I did.

1167
01:16:57,480 --> 01:17:01,639
My accident changed my life.

1168
01:17:01,639 --> 01:17:07,360
I know that even if I could travel back in
time, I wouldn't change anything.

1169
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:12,429
I would still say goodbye to Megan and Kristi
and continue alone.

1170
01:17:12,429 --> 01:17:15,519
I've learned a lot from that choice.

1171
01:17:15,519 --> 01:17:20,590
I believe we are on Earth to do the things
we love, even if that means making a hard

1172
01:17:20,590 --> 01:17:22,010
choice.

1173
01:17:22,010 --> 01:17:27,729
Sometimes, that means cutting out something
and leaving it in the past.

1174
01:17:27,729 --> 01:17:37,719
Saying goodbye to things from our past is
also a new beginning.

1175
01:17:37,719 --> 01:17:37,979
- THE END -
