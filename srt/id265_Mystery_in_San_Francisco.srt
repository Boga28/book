CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:03,560
Washington Square

3
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:05,200
Jim Reilly was fourteen years old and he lived in the beautiful
city of San Francisco in California.

4
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,880
He was short, thin and wore glasses.

5
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:09,920
He had brown hair and blue eyes.

6
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:14,120
His mother died when he was six years old and his father lived
in another city.

7
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,200
Jim lived with his grandfather.

8
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,520
This was his first year in high school and he liked it a lot.


9
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,360
His favorite subject was science.

10
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:27,080
On weekends he had a part-time job at a supermarket to make extra
pocket money.

11
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:30,680
Jim's home was on Telegraph Hill near San Francisco Bay.

12
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:35,080
From his living room he could see the Golden Gate Bridge and
the bay.

13
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:38,160
Every morning he walked down Telegraph Hill.

14
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,480
He met his friends at the bus stop at Washington Square.

15
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,360
They went to high school together.

16
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:49,160
Washington Square was a historical landmark and the people of
San Francisco loved to go there.

17
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:52,440
It was a lovely park for children and adults.

18
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,040
There was a small playground for children.

19
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,840
It was also a place for the people of the North Beach neighborhood
to meet.

20
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:04,160
There were restaurants, cafes and nice shops around Washington
Square.

21
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,640
Often there were music and arts festivals.

22
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,320
Normally, Washington Square had green grass and beautiful flowers.


23
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:17,720
But there was no rain for a long time, and the grass was dry
and yellow and the flowers were dead.

24
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,880
'Hi, Jim,' said Brian.

25
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,240
Brian Wilson was Jim's best friend.

26
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,160
He was fourteen too.

27
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:28,520
He was a tall boy, with blond, curly hair and green eyes.

28
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:31,160
He played basketball on the high school team.

29
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:35,000
His parents had a grocery store and he helped them on weekends.


30
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,600
'Hi, Brian. Did you finish your English homework?' said Jim.

31
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,240
'Yes, I did, but Shakespeare wasn't easy.

32
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,720
Look, there's Susan,' said Brian.

33
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,840
'Hi, guys,' said Susan.

34
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,920
Susan Hardy was a pretty African-American girl.

35
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,680
She was a good friend of both boys.

36
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,200
She was also a very good student.

37
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,480
She had a part-time job as a babysitter for the children of her
neighbors, the Moreno family.

38
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,240
Her brother Tom was twenty years old.

39
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:11,680
He was a biology student at San Francisco University and played
on the university football team.

40
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,920
'Are you ready for the math test?' asked Susan.

41
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:19,440
'I studied all afternoon yesterday, but I'm not ready,' said
Brian.

42
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,680
'I'm not either.

43
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,760
I didn't look at my notes,' said Jim.

44
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,880
The bus came and they got on.

45
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,640
They saw their school friends and started talking.

46
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:31,000
The bus was always crowded, but the bus ride was fun.

47
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,640
When they got near Galileo High School they could smell the chocolate
from the chocolate factory nearby.

48
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,040
They loved the smell of the chocolate.

49
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,640
It made them hungry.

50
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,640
The math test was difficult.

51
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,000
The students were happy when it was finally lunchtime.

52
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,320
hey all went to the big school cafeteria.

53
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,920
'Why is math so difficult?' said Jim.

54
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:56,280
'I think Mrs Miller makes the test difficult.'

55
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,160
'Don't worry about the test and eat your lunch,' said Brian.

56
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,920
In the afternoon they had a long science lesson.

57
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,080
It was very interesting.

58
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,560
They studied chemistry in the school laboratory.

59
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,680
They often did experiments with their chemistry teacher, Mr Woods.


60
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,120
They liked Mr Woods.

61
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,600
At a quarter past three the school bell rang.

62
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,480
It was time to go home and it was Friday.

63
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,560
'What are you doing this weekend?' asked Brian.

64
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,440
'I'm working at the supermarket tomorrow,' said Jim.

65
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,880
'But on Sunday I'm coming to see your basketball game.'

66
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,200
'I hope we win,' said Brian.

67
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,000
'I'm working tomorrow as well, at my parents' grocery store.

68
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,240
It's always a busy day.

69
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,560
But I'm free tomorrow night.'

70
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:46,760
'Well, I'm babysitting for the Moreno children all weekend,'
said Susan.

71
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:50,880
'Do you want to go to the movies tomorrow night, Jim?' asked
Brian.

72
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:54,920
'Yes, that's a great idea,' said Jim.

73
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,640
'I'll phone you.'

74
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,240
CHAPTER TWO

75
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,800
The Face at the Window

76
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,320
Jim walked slowly up Telegraph Hill.

77
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:07,040
It was a foggy afternoon in February.

78
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,640
Every day Jim walked in front of an old mansion.

79
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:14,480
It was a mysterious wooden building with a big garden and a fence
around it.

80
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,280
Jim often looked at it and thought, 'What's inside?

81
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,880
Why doesn't anyone live here?'

82
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:23,040
That afternoon he stopped in front of the gate.

83
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,760
He looked at the garden and the trees.

84
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,160
What a strange place.

85
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,960
No one took care of it.

86
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,120
Then he looked up at the old mansion.

87
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,760
He looked at the window on the second floor.

88
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,640
There was a face behind it.

89
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,000
He felt cold.

90
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,280
It was the face of a little girl with long, dark hair.

91
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,960
But no one lived in that mansion.

92
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,520
Who was it?

93
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,400
A ghost?

94
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,640
Jim didn't believe in ghosts, but who was the girl at the window?


95
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,120
She looked down at him.

96
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,200
He continued looking at the window.

97
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,840
Suddenly the face of the girl disappeared.

98
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:00,000
Jim could not see well because it was very foggy.

99
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,040
He decided to go home quickly.

100
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,880
He walked in the door and into the living room.

101
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,720
He saw his grandfather in the corner of the room.

102
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:11,760
'Grandpa!' he cried 'I saw a ghost!'

103
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,880
'What did you say?' asked his grandfather with a smile.

104
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,440
'I saw the face of a little girl at the window of the old mansion.


105
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:22,040
No one lives there, but I saw a girl.

106
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,480
She looked at me!'

107
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:26,960
'Are you sure, Jim? It' s a very foggy afternoon.

108
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,240
Did you see her clearly?

109
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,280
No one lives in the old Stewart mansion.

110
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,320
It's about one hundred years old.

111
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,760
There's a strange story about it, but I don't think there are
any ghosts.'

112
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,720
'What story? Please tell me!'

113
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,720
said Jim.

114
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,560
'Well, Mr Stewart was a very rich, but very strange man.

115
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,200
He was very interested in science and experiments.

116
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,040
He had a lot of enemies.

117
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:56,720
People thought his experiments were mysterious and sinister.

118
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,600
His wife and daughter died in a mysterious accident.

119
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,560
It was terrible.

120
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,320
He left San Francisco and returned to New York.'

121
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,760
'I saw a face, grandpa - I did!' said Jim.

122
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:13,880
'But, Jim, you don't believe in ghosts,' said his grandfather.


123
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:17,240
'You're right - but I saw that girl's face,' said Jim.

124
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:21,840
'Maybe it was your imagination,' said his grandfather kindly.


125
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,720
Jim went to his room and turned on the radio.

126
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,080
He listened to some songs and then started doing his homework.


127
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,600
The next day Jim went to work at the supermarket.

128
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,400
It was a busy day.

129
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:36,960
A strange man with long hair and a silver earring came in.

130
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,480
His clothes were old.

131
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:42,600
Customers were usually friendly but this man was not.

132
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,840
He had an angry expression, paid quickly and left.

133
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,960
There was something strange about him.

134
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,920
When Jim went home that evening he phoned Brian.

135
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,760
'Hi. How was your day?'

136
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,960
'Very busy,' said Brian.

137
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,800
'Yes, mine too.

138
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:03,040
Do you want to see that new science fiction movie on at The Big
Screen movie theater?

139
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:07,040
We can meet at 7 p.m. in front of the park,' said Jim.

140
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:11,840
'OK. I' ll see you then,' said Brian, 'at Washington Square.'


141
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,200
'Don't be late.'

142
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,600
Jim left the house and started walking to the park.

143
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:20,080
He stopped in front of the gate of the old Stewart mansion again.


144
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,000
There was no one at the window.

145
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,720
He stayed there a few minutes.

146
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:29,600
It was windy and the big trees in the garden made strange noises.


147
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,120
He looked at his watch.

148
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,360
It was nearly seven o'clock.

149
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,520
He was late to meet Brian.

150
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,040
CHAPTER THREE

151
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,480
The Stewart Mansion

152
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:43,400
After the movies the two boys went to eat an ice-cream at Pier
39.

153
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,240
It was a beautiful night.

154
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:49,520
They stopped and looked at Alcatraz Island in the middle of San
Francisco Bay.

155
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,400
Jim told Brian about the face at the window.

156
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,520
'What?' said Brian.

157
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,840
'I don't believe it.

158
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,200
I want to come with you next week.

159
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,960
I want to see her too.'

160
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:04,600
'Really? That' s great!' said Jim.

161
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,960
'It's a strange place.

162
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,560
I'm always a little afraid when I go alone.

163
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,280
Let's go together soon.'

164
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,960
On Monday after school the two friends met Susan at the bus stop.


165
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,560
They got on the bus.

166
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,240
'Where are you going?' Susan asked.

167
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,320
'Can you keep a secret?' asked Jim.

168
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:27,040
'Why? Do you have a secret?' asked Susan.

169
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:30,200
'Yes, I do,' said Jim.

170
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:34,040
'Is it about Jenny Lee's new boyfriend?' asked Susan.

171
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:37,400
Jenny was a very popular girl in their class.

172
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,640
Susan hoped Jenny Lee's new boyfriend wasn't Jim.

173
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,040
He told her about the Stewart mansion and about the face at the
window.

174
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:51,200
Then he told his friends his grandfather's story about the mansion,
the scientist and the mysterious accident.

175
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,840
'Scary!' said Susan.

176
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:57,320
'Old mansions always have ghosts. Can I come with you?'

177
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:01,560
Jim smiled at her and said, Of course, but promise not to tell
anyone.'

178
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,200
Jim was happy that Susan wanted to come.

179
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,800
Susan was pretty.

180
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,840
'Hey, come on, it's our stop,' said Brian.

181
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,280
'Let's get off.'

182
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:14,600
It was 4.30 p.m. and it was a cold, sunny afternoon.

183
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,400
The three friends walked up Telegraph Hill.

184
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:21,840
When they arrived at the Stewart mansion they stopped in front
of the old gate.

185
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,960
'What a strange place,' said Susan.

186
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,720
'It's cool!' said Brian.

187
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,000
They looked at the window on the second floor but they saw nothing.


188
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,680
They started talking and looking around.

189
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,920
'Hey, do you smell anything strange?' said Susan.

190
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,960
They stopped and smelled the air.

191
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,480
There was a very bad smell in the air.

192
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,200
'What is that smell?' asked Brian.

193
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,040
'I don't know.

194
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,840
It smells like rotten eggs!' said Jim.

195
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:56,280
'Yes, that's true. But where is it coming from?' asked Brian.


196
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,560
Susan and Br an looked at Jim.

197
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,280
Then they looked at the window on the second floor again.

198
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:05,000
'Are you sure you saw a face, Jim?' asked Susan.

199
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,840
Jim didn't know what to say.

200
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,120
There was no one at the window now.

201
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:14,000
'This is a scary place but I don't see any ghosts,' said Brian.


202
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,920
'This smell is terrible,' said Susan.

203
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,400
'Let's go home and forget about the ghost.

204
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,120
It was probably your imagination, Jim.

205
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,960
'Look!' cried Jim.

206
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,320
'There's yellow smoke over there.'

207
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:31,320
Near the bottom window of the mansion they saw strange yellow
smoke in the air.

208
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:35,000
'Wow! You' re right,' said Susan.

209
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,920
'What's happening here?' said Brian.

210
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,520
'It smells like a dead body. Maybe there' s a dead body in the
mansion!

211
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:46,040
Maybe this is a secret cemetery,' said Jim.

212
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,200
Brian's face became white.

213
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,360
The three friends looked at each other.

214
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,760
'A secret cemetery?' they said softly.

215
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,440
They were curious but terrified at the same time.

216
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,240
No one knew what to say.

217
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,800
'Oh, please let's go home.

218
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,480
This place frightens me,' said Susan.

219
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:09,080
'There's something strange happening here,' said Brian.

220
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:14,280
They agreed to leave, and went to Jim's house to listen to his
new CDs.

221
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:17,440
They sat in Jim's room and talked about the mansion.

222
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:23,600
Then Susan suddenly said, 'Hey, there's the big Chinese New Year
parade this Saturday night.

223
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,920
I'm taking the Moreno children.'

224
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,000
'It's always lots of fun,' said Jim.

225
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,280
'I'm going to go.'

226
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,200
'Me too,' said Brian.

227
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,160
CHAPTER FOUR

228
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,440
Chinese New Year

229
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,960
This was the Year of the Dragon.

230
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:40,160
The Chinese believe that the dragon brings good luck.

231
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:44,360
The Chinese New Year Parade is a very big event in San Francisco.


232
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:50,960
It always takes place on a Saturday night between January 21
and February 19.

233
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,640
The date depends on the position of the moon.

234
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:57,000
Thousands of people go to see the parade every year.

235
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:04,400
There are many beautiful costumes, Chinese music and Grant Avenue
is decorated with colorful lanterns.

236
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,400
A long paper dragon moves along Grant Avenue.

237
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,320
There are firecrackers and lots of noise.

238
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,760
Jim and Brian took the cable car to Grant Avenue.

239
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,400
It was always fun to ride the cable car.

240
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:20,000
Susan and their high school friends were at the parade.

241
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,600
Jenny Lee was there with her new boyfriend.

242
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:26,160
He was the captain of the football team and he was handsome.

243
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,760
There was a big crowd everywhere.

244
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:34,600
Suddenly, on the other side of the street Jim saw the face of
the little girl at the window in the crowd.

245
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,720
Jim told Brian.

246
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,520
'Let's follow her,' said Brian.

247
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:43,240
It was difficult to move because there were lots of people everywhere.


248
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:46,560
Then the big paper dragon appeared in the parade.

249
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,000
The little girl suddenly disappeared behind the long dragon.

250
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,600
'How can anyone disappear so quickly?' said Jim.

251
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,080
They went back to watch the parade.

252
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,560
'Maybe she is a ghost,' he thought.

253
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,280
The weekend passed quickly.

254
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:03,080
It was Monday morning and they were at school.

255
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,800
Brian and Jim told Susan about the girl.

256
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:09,320
Now she wanted to explore the Stewart mansion too.

257
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,360
They made plans during lunch.

258
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,360
'Let's go this evening after dinner.

259
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:18,240
Remember to bring a flashlight and wear dark clothes,' said Jim.


260
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,080
They were very excited.

261
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:24,120
When school finished at 3:15 p.m. they ran out.

262
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,040
They wanted to go home quickly.

263
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:30,520
At about 7 p.m. they met in front of Jim's house on Telegraph
Hill.

264
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:34,040
When they arrived at the Stewart mansion everything was dark.


265
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,320
It was a foggy, windy night.

266
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,320
They looked at the window on the second floor, but there was
no one there.

267
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,480
They climbed over the fence and went into the garden.

268
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,160
The tall trees moved in the wind.

269
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,440
'I don't smell anything this time,' said Susan.

270
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,680
'Me neither,' agreed Jim.

271
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,040
'And now what do we do?' asked Brian.

272
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,600
'I don't know,' said Jim.

273
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,080
Let's look inside.

274
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,840
here are windows near the ground, said Susan.

275
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:05,160
'And let's remember to be very quiet,' she whispered.

276
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,240
'OK,' said Jim.

277
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:10,400
The three friends went to a window and looked inside.

278
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,360
The glass was old and dirty.

279
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,800
Brian turned on his flashlight and looked.

280
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,080
There was a small room with an old desk and some chairs.

281
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:21,880
'This was probably the study,' said Brian.

282
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,160
Susan turned on her flashlight.

283
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,400
'Look at the newspaper on the desk,' said Susan.

284
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:31,520
'I can't see well, but it I think it's yesterday's newspaper.


285
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:35,560
Look at the headline: 'Water scarce in San Francisco.'

286
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,880
'But no one lives here,' said Jim.

287
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:42,800
They looked inside another window and saw a big room with old
furniture.

288
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,400
It looked like the living room.

289
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:49,640
On the wall there was a big painting of a man, a woman and a
little girl.

290
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:54,520
'Look, that's probably a painting of the Stewart family,' said
Susan.

291
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:58,240
'Yes, before the mysterious accident,' said Jim.

292
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:04,360
'And the little girl has long, dark hair. She looks like the
girl at the window,' said Susan.

293
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:08,040
'But we saw the little girl at the parade,' said Brian.

294
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,840
'How can she be a ghost?'

295
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:15,040
'Remember, she disappeared behind the dragon very quickly,' said
Jim.

296
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,560
They went to the other side of the mansion.

297
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:20,520
There was a broken window near the bottom of the house.

298
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,960
They looked inside.

299
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:24,080
They saw a big dark basement.

300
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,560
No one was there.

301
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:28,800
Then Jim turned on his flashlight too.

302
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,480
In the basement they saw some long tables.

303
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:37,040
There were test tubes, glass bottles and other laboratory equipment.


304
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,640
'This looks like our chemistry lab,' said Jim.

305
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,640
'Maybe someone is using it,' said Susan.

306
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,920
'But why?'

307
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:49,880
'Maybe someone is experimenting... with something secret,' said
Brian.

308
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:53,760
'I don't like this place,' said Susan.

309
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:58,360
'It gives me a bad feeling. ' Are you scared?' asked Brian.

310
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:02,800
'No, I want to come back again, but in the daytime,' said Susan.


311
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,680
'OK,' said Jim.

312
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,000
'Let's go then.'

313
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,120
Crash!

314
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,120
There was a loud noise.

315
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,760
It came from one of the rooms upstairs.

316
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:14,240
'What was that?' cried Susan.

317
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,760
'We're not alone here.

318
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:19,360
Someone or something is here,' said Jim.

319
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,920
'Let's get out of here!' said Brian.

320
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,960
They started running to the fence.

321
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:29,760
They ran under the trees and suddenly heard a strange sound from
the branches above their heads.

322
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,880
They looked up.

323
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,960
'Eek!' cried Susan.

324
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,160
'Bats!'

325
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,840
They climbed over the fence quickly and ran away.

326
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,160
CHAPTER FIVE

327
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,760
A Mysterious Magician

328
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:42,000
Jim heard the voice of a child in the fog.

329
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,840
'Help! Help!'

330
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:47,760
It was a cold night Jim stood in front of the Stewart mansion.


331
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,760
There was fog everywhere.

332
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,600
The voice came from inside the mansion.

333
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,160
He didn't know what to do.

334
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:58,360
He wanted to help the child, but he also wanted to run away.

335
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:01,480
Suddenly he felt a hand on his arm.

336
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,120
For a moment his heart stopped.

337
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,920
He could not turn around.

338
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,560
He was too scared.

339
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:11,160
An angry voice behind him said, 'What do you want?'

340
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,200
Jim turned around slowly.

341
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:17,000
He saw a big mar with long, dark hair and angry eyes.

342
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,880
'It's the same man I saw at the supermarket two weeks ago,' he
thought.

343
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,040
He was about fifty years old.

344
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:26,360
He had a silver tooth and it shone in the dark.

345
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,560
He also had a silver earring.

346
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,960
He was awful.

347
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,600
'Well, what do you want here?'

348
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:37,240
Jim looked at him and said, 'Noth... nothing...

349
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,760
Who are you?'

350
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,680
'Don't ask questions.

351
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,360
Stay away from here.

352
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,120
I'm a dangerous man.

353
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:47,560
I eliminate problems and you're a problem.

354
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,840
Go away now.'

355
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,920
He pushed Jim to the ground and disappeared in the fog.

356
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,280
Jim woke up.

357
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,760
He was scared.

358
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:59,080
'Phew! It was only a dream,' he thought.

359
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,040
He looked at his alarm clock.

360
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,760
It was 3 a.m.

361
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:08,080
The next day Jim, Brian and Susan went back to the mansion in
the afternoon.

362
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,280
They went to the basement window.

363
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,880
No one was there.

364
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,920
But there was a big black book on one of the tables.

365
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:19,720
'Someone was here last night or this morning. There' s a book
on the table.

366
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,160
It wasn't here last night,' said Jim.

367
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,400
'You're right!' said Brian.

368
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,000
'And who has the keys to the mansion?' asked Susan.

369
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,640
'That's a good question,' said Brian.

370
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,840
The days passed and something else happened.

371
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:38,480
The grass in Washington Square was green again and there were
flowers!

372
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,320
Everyone in the neighborhood was surprised and happy.

373
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,800
Jim talked with his grandfather about this.

374
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,120
'Grandpa, it's amazing.

375
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,720
Washington Square is beautiful again.

376
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,400
The grass and the flowers are growing.

377
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,720
But how?

378
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,080
There's no rain.

379
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:58,560
How can grass and flowers grow without water?' said Jim.

380
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,560
'You're right.

381
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,000
It's strange.

382
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,680
There's no rain but the grass is growing,' said Grandpa.

383
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,480
'There's an article in today's newspaper about it.'

384
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,160
Jim started reading.

385
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,800
Washington Square: who is the magician?

386
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:15,480
The grass and flowers are growing again in Washington Square.


387
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:19,400
The square was dry for months but now it is beautiful and green.


388
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:29,720
The organizer of the Jazz Festival, Mike Murphy, says, 'I thought it wasn't possible to have the
Jazz Festival this year, but now it's beautiful and we can have the festival as we always do.

389
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:32,960
Artists from all over California are coming this year.'

390
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,880
Some people believe something mysterious is happening in Washington
Square.

391
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,480
One person said.

392
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:43,160
'There's no rain, but the grass and the flowers are growing.

393
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:47,320
I don't believe in magic, but it's very strange.'

394
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,840
Who is the magician?

395
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:53,720
Mr Magician, can you bring San Francisco some rain too?

396
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,400
CHAPTER SIX

397
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,200
The Game

398
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:00,480
One afternoon Susan took the Moreno children to Washington Square.


399
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,680
They played in the small playground.

400
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,600
Then they went to the duck pond.

401
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,280
The children liked feeding the ducks in the pond.

402
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,360
But the ducks were not hungry.

403
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:14,280
'Susie, why aren't the ducks eating the bread?' asked little
Sally Moreno.

404
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,320
'I don't know.

405
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,760
It's strange.

406
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,280
They're usually hungry.

407
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:22,160
The fish aren't hungry either, said Susan.

408
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:25,760
'Well, it's half past five and it's time to go home.'

409
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:30,720
The next morning there was a big crowd at Washington Square.

410
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:35,200
Jim, Brian and Susan were there with many other people.

411
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,440
Everyone was at the duck pond.

412
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,840
Some of the ducks were dead and others were sick.

413
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,840
Lots of fish were dead too.

414
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,760
'This is terrible,' said Susan.

415
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:49,000
'Someone poisoned those poor ducks,' said Jim.

416
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,680
At that moment the bus came and the students got on.

417
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:56,640
On the bus everyone continued talking about the ducks.

418
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,920
Early the next morning Jim's grandfather bought the newspaper.


419
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,920
During breakfast this is what they read:

420
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,680
Dead ducks at popular City Square

421
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:10,800
Eight ducks and many fish were found dead in the pond in Washington
Square yesterday morning.

422
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:14,360
Only last week people came to see the Jazz Festival.

423
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,960
It was a great success.

424
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:22,040
A scientist analyzed the grass and the water in the pond, and
found a high quantity of a new chemical.

425
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:27,240
'The new chemical is similar to Greenex, but it is more toxic.


426
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:30,480
Greenex was a popular fertilizer twenty years ago.

427
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,560
It is illegal to use it today,' the scientist said.

428
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:38,920
The volunteer organization Helping Hands is now looking after
the sick ducks.

429
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:44,400
Volunteers can call this number: 392-0369.

430
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,520
The San Francisco Police Department are investigating the case.


431
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:51,400
'Wow!' exclaimed Jim.

432
00:21:51,400 --> 00:22:00,440
'This mysterious new chemical is responsible for the green grass.
So someone created a new fertilizer and it' s toxic.'

433
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:04,320
'What irresponsible people,' said Jim's grandfather.

434
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,920
'Think of the children. They play in Washington Square.'

435
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:11,480
On Thursday evening Jim and Brian were at Susan's house.

436
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:18,080
'This fertilizer thing is so strange. Maybe it' s a mad scientist,'
said Brian.

437
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:22,200
'Maybe they can make a lot of money with this new fertilizer,'
said Jim.

438
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:27,320
'Yes, a lot of money. And they' ll poison all the animals,' said
Brian.

439
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:32,920
Susan was quiet for a few minutes, then she said, 'I want to
solve this mystery.

440
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:38,640
I think there's a connection between the Stewart mansion and
this fertilizer, but I don't I know...'

441
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:43,200
On Friday evening Susan went to see her brother's football game.


442
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,160
It was San Francisco University versus Monterey University.

443
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,000
Tom was a good player.

444
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,560
The stadium was almost full.

445
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:54,000
Susan found a good seat to watch the game.

446
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,920
Susan liked football games.

447
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,680
She always went to watch her brother play.

448
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:02,400
It was a cold night and she put her hands in her pockets.

449
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,720
'I'm glad I have a warm jacket,' she thought.

450
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,840
Then she looked at her watch.

451
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,760
It was almost half past eight.

452
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,480
It was time for the big game to start.

453
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,120
She was excited.

454
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:18,480
Suddenly two people behind her started talking about Washington
Square.

455
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:23,120
But she could not hear all of their conversation because there
was lots of noise.

456
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,680
She listened carefully.

457
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:29,360
'...can't test anymore ... not now...' said one young woman.

458
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,800
'...too dangerous...' said the other.

459
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,920
'These people know something,' thought Susan.

460
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:38,320
She continued listening but she did not look at them.

461
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:43,880
'...it's illegal... but the experiment... almost finished...'
said one voice.

462
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:48,560
'...alright... on Lombard Street...' said the other voice.

463
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,240
'Lombard Street!

464
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,840
The Stewart mansion is on Lombard Street.

465
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:59,480
So there is a connection between the mansion and Washington Square,'
Susan thought.

466
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,160
Suddenly she understood.

467
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:04,480
'I must tell Jim and Brian,' she thought.

468
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,120
She was very excited and looked at her watch.

469
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:11,280
The game finished on time and San Francisco University won.

470
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,520
After the game she phoned Jim.

471
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:17,120
She told him about the conversation between the two young women.


472
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,320
'You're a great detective Susan.

473
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,480
You're right.

474
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,800
It's that secret laboratory,' said Jim.

475
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,880
'Let's tell police immediately,' said Susan.

476
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,840
'Yes, that's the right thing to do.

477
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,600
Tomorrow's Saturday.

478
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:38,440
Let's meet early in the morning,' said Jim, 'I'll call the supermarket
and tell them I can't work.'

479
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,560
'OK,' said Susan.

480
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,320
I'll call Brian now.'

481
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,880
'It was lucky I went to Tom's football game,' she thought.

482
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,200
CHAPTER SEVEN

483
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,360
The Police Station

484
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:53,360
On Saturday morning Jim, Brian and Susan went to Chinatown Police
Station.

485
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:57,120
'Good afternoon,' Brian said to the policeman at the door.

486
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,080
'What can I do for you?' asked the policeman.

487
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,280
'We want to report something,' said Brian.

488
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:08,560
'Come to my office and sit down, said the policeman. ' I'm Sergeant
Chan.'

489
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:11,400
They explained everything to Sergeant Chan.

490
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,480
He was interested and a little surprised.

491
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:18,440
'Why were you at the Stewart mansion?' asked Sergeant Chan.

492
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:22,760
'One day I saw the face of a little girl at the window,' said
Jim.

493
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:26,400
'I told my friends and we wanted to explore it.'

494
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:31,600
'Did you see anyone inside this 'secret lab?' asked Sergeant
Chan.

495
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,760
'No, we didn't,' said Jim.

496
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:37,680
'I understand,' said Sergeant Chan.

497
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:46,280
'The mansion is very close to Washington Square. Perhaps you discovered
something interesting that night. I' ll send some officers to investigate.

498
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,160
I want you to come too.

499
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:50,200
You know where the laboratory is.

500
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,480
I'll phone you'

501
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,440
'Yes, Sergeant,' answered Jim.

502
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,400
In the afternoon the phone rang at Jim's house.

503
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:02,600
'Hello, this is Sergeant Chan of the San Francisco Police Department.
May I speak to Jim Reilly?'

504
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:06,080
'This is Jim Reilly. Hello Sergeant Chan.'

505
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:12,960
'Jim, my officers and I are going to investigate the Stewart
mansion. Can we meet you at 5 o' clock this afternoon?'

506
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:18,760
'Of course. Let' s meet in front of my house at 325 Lombard Street.


507
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:21,480
Then we can go together,' said Jim.

508
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:27,640
'You and your friends wait outside your house. We' ll go in a
police car, said Sergeant Chan.

509
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,680
'We'll see you at 5 o'clock then.

510
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,600
Goodbye.'

511
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,040
Jim was excited.

512
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:34,680
He told his grandfather about the phone call.

513
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:37,200
'I'm very proud of you and your friends.

514
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,480
You're doing the right thing,' said his grandfather.

515
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,080
He smiled, but he was worried.

516
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,480
'Thanks, grandpa.'

517
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,880
Jim called Brian and Susan.

518
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:52,360
'Meet me outside my house. The police are going to drive us to
the mansion.'

519
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,960
It was 5 p.m.

520
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:57,000
Jim saw two police cars in front of his house.

521
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,960
He and his friends got into the police car with Sergeant Chan.


522
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:05,880
'Good evening. This is Sergeant Lopez,' said Sergeant Chan.

523
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:09,920
'Pleased to meet you, sir,' said Jim, Brian and Susan.

524
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:15,640
'Now this is our plan. We' ll drive to the mansion and my officers
and I will go in.

525
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:18,760
Jim, you will show us the basement window.

526
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:21,760
After that you must stay outside the mansion.

527
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:25,120
Only the police will enter because it can be dangerous.

528
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,480
Do you understand?'

529
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:31,760
'Yes I do sir, I'll wait outside with my friends,' said Jim.

530
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,840
The police car drove up Telegraph Hill.

531
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:41,920
When they arrived in front of the Stewart mansion, Jim, Sergeant
Chan and Sergeant Lopez got out of the car.

532
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,600
Three policemen got out of the second car.

533
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,480
The five men followed Jim.

534
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,440
He took them to the gate.

535
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,280
The policeman looked around.

536
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:55,920
'You go around the back of the house and we'll go around the
front,' said Sergeant Chan to the other policemen.

537
00:27:55,920 --> 00:28:00,000
'Where did you see this laboratory?' Sergeant Chan asked Jim.


538
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,120
'Over there by the window,' replied Jim.

539
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:06,000
They saw yellow smoke near the basement window.

540
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,920
There was a bad smell like before.

541
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:12,680
'That's the smell of sulphur,' said Sergeant Chan.

542
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,400
'And it's very strong.'

543
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,520
He opened the gate and went in.

544
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,560
The other policemen followed him.

545
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:22,400
Jim remained outside with his friends and waited.

546
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,880
CHAPTER EIGHT

547
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,480
The Secret Formula

548
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:30,240
There were four young people in the laboratory, two women and
two men.

549
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:34,960
They were in their early twenties and they were very busy with
an experiment.

550
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,880
They stood around the long table.

551
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,680
One woman wrote something in the big black book.

552
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:42,240
The other three worked with the test tubes.

553
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,080
There was a portable computer on a small desk.

554
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:48,400
Near the desk there was a little girl.

555
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:52,000
The little girl was with the man with long hair and a silver
earring.

556
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,200
Sergeant Chan looked inside the basement window and saw people
in the laboratory.

557
00:28:56,200 --> 00:29:04,040
'Jim Reilly was right. There is an illegal laboratory here. Let'
s go in!' said Sergeant Chan to his men.

558
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:07,640
The police broke the front door and went into the mansion.

559
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:10,680
They immediately went to the basement.

560
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:18,400
'This is the San Francisco Police Department! Put your hands
over your heads,' Sergeant Lopez cried.

561
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:23,320
'You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can be
used against you...'

562
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:26,440
The young people were surprised and angry.

563
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:29,520
'Oh, no!' cried one young man.

564
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:33,560
He and his friend ran to another door but the police stopped
them.

565
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:40,600
'Who are you and what are you doing here? Do you know you are
on private property?' said Sergeant Chan.

566
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,560
One of the young women spoke.

567
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,440
She was very nervous.

568
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:48,080
'My name is Barbara Dell. We aren' t criminals.

569
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:52,360
We're students at San Francisco University in the Department
of Chemistry.'

570
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:57,120
'Who's that man? He doesn't look like a student,' said Sergeant
Chan.

571
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,000
'He's Ben Bradley.

572
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:04,160
He has the key to the mansion because his grandfather was a gardener
here many years ago.

573
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,080
Now Ben doesn't have a home.

574
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,440
He sleeps here at night.' said Barbara Dell.

575
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,680
'Oh, shut up!' said Ben Bradley angrily.

576
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:15,720
'Be quiet!' said Sergeant Chan.

577
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:18,560
'Now continue your story.'

578
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:22,360
'Don't tell them anything, Barbara!' cried one of the young men.


579
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,480
'The formula is our secret.'

580
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,360
'I want to tell the truth,' said Barbara.

581
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:30,240
'We discovered a new molecule at the university.

582
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:34,880
With this molecule we created a new formula for a powerful fertilizer.


583
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,760
People can use this fertilizer without water.

584
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,280
We knew that no one lived in this mansion.

585
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:46,680
And we knew that there was an old laboratory in the basement
because Mr Stewart was a scientist.

586
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:49,040
We wanted to keep this a secret because...'

587
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:52,800
'Because you wanted to sell it to a company and make a lot of
money.

588
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:56,160
And you tested the fertilizer in Washington Square.

589
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:59,200
You polluted the water of the duck pond.

590
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,440
You killed the ducks and the fish.

591
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,680
Your new fertilizer is toxic and very dangerous.

592
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:07,880
Do you know that children play in the park near the duck pond?'


593
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:10,400
asked Sergeant Chan angrily.

594
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:15,520
'We didn't want to pollute the water in the pond or the grass
in the park,' said one of the young men.

595
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:18,360
'We just wanted to test the new fertilizer.'

596
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:24,640
'And you decided to test it in a public park! Didn' t you think
about the people and the wildlife?

597
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:28,760
You four must come with us to the Police Station,' said Sergeant
Chan.

598
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:32,680
'We will also take all the chemicals you are using in this laboratory.'


599
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:36,600
The little girl at the desk was scared and started crying.

600
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,560
She ran to Barbara Dell.

601
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:41,520
'Who is she?' asked Sergeant Lopez.

602
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,360
'She's my little sister.

603
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,200
I bring her here sometimes,' said Barbara.

604
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:51,680
Then the policemen, the university students and Ben Bradley came
out of the mansion.

605
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:54,720
Jim, Brian and Susan were outside.

606
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,120
When Jim saw Ben Bradley he was very surprised.

607
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:01,800
'It's the man from the supermarket,' he thought.

608
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,520
The little girl looked at Jim.

609
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,280
'Well, she's not a ghost.

610
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,880
She's real,' he thought.

611
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:13,280
Sergeant Chan smiled at Jim, Brian and Susan and said, 'You helped
us a lot.

612
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,480
Thank you.

613
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:18,480
Come to the Police Station tomorrow and I'll explain everything.


614
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,760
Thank you again.'

615
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,280
The police cars drove away.

616
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:27,200
The next day the three friends went to talk to Sergeant Chan.


617
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:31,520
'Those university students were very intelligent,' said Jim.

618
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,880
'They created a new formula.'

619
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:37,480
'Yes, but they were also very irresponsible.

620
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:40,840
We found many illegal chemicals in that basement.

621
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,600
Those chemicals are very toxic.

622
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,640
Now we must close Washington Square for a few weeks.

623
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:51,240
There will be a lot of work for our chemical experts,' said Sergeant
Chan.

624
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:55,040
'What will happen to the university students?' asked Susan.

625
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,960
