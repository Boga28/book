1
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:12,520
Mr Hiram B. Otis was a rich American from
New York.

2
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:17,290
He had come to live and work in England, but
he did not want to live in London.

3
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:19,520
He did not want to live in the city.

4
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,800
He wanted to live in the countryside outside
London.

5
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:28,300
Canterville Chase was a large and very old
house near London.

6
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:31,119
Lord Canterville, the owner, wanted to sell
it.

7
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:34,770
So Mr Hiram B. Otis visited Lord Canterville.

8
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:40,760
'I do not live in Canterville Chase,' Lord
Canterville said to Mr Otis.

9
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,649
'I do not want to live there.

10
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:47,510
The house has a ghost - The Canterville Ghost.'

11
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:51,699
'I come from America,' said Mr Otis.

12
00:00:51,699 --> 00:00:53,780
'America is a modern country.

13
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:55,510
I don't believe in ghosts.

14
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:58,719
Have you seen this Canterville Ghost?'

15
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:03,219
'No,' said Lord Canterville, 'but I have heard
it at night.'

16
00:01:03,219 --> 00:01:07,590
'I don't believe in ghosts,' Mr Otis said
again.

17
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:10,300
'No one has found a ghost.

18
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,600
No one has put a ghost in a museum.

19
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,890
And you haven't seen this ghost either.'

20
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:21,119
'But several members of my family have seen
it,' said Lord Canterville.

21
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,890
'My aunt saw the ghost.

22
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:28,520
She was so frightened that she was ill for
the rest of her life.

23
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:33,909
Also, the servants have seen it so they will
not stay in the house at night.

24
00:01:33,909 --> 00:01:39,420
Only the housekeeper, Mrs Umney, lives in
Canterville Chase.

25
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,649
Mrs Umney lives there alone.'

26
00:01:41,649 --> 00:01:46,090
'I want to buy the house,' said Mr Otis.

27
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:47,869
'I'll buy the ghost as well.

28
00:01:47,869 --> 00:01:49,880
Will you sell Canterville Chase?

29
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,090
Will you sell the ghost?'

30
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:54,540
'Yes, I will,' said Lord Canterville.

31
00:01:54,540 --> 00:02:11,070
'But, please remember, I told you about the
ghost before you bought the house.'

32
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:14,840
Mr Hiram B. Otis bought Canterville Chase.

33
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,930
Then his family came to England from America.

34
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:22,770
He had a wife called Lucretia, three sons
and a daughter.

35
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:27,260
The eldest son, Washington, was almost twenty
years old.

36
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:30,330
He was good-looking and had fair hair.

37
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:32,750
His two young brothers were twins.

38
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,710
They were twelve years old.

39
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:38,600
The daughter, Virginia, was fifteen years
old.

40
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:42,890
She had large blue eyes and a lovely face.

41
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:46,820
Mr Otis took his family to live at Canterville
Chase.

42
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:50,700
The old house was in the countryside west
of London.

43
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:54,610
Mr Otis and his family travelled from London
by train.

44
00:02:54,610 --> 00:03:00,070
Then they rode to the house in a wagon pulled
by two horses.

45
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:03,140
Canterville Chase was big and old.

46
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:05,570
Trees grew all around the house.

47
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:11,220
The Otis family wanted to stop and look at
the outside of the house, but the sky darkened.

48
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,670
A thunderstorm was coming.

49
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:19,490
Rain started to fall, so the family went inside
the house quickly.

50
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:24,060
Mrs Umney, the housekeeper, was waiting for
them by the front door.

51
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:28,510
She was an old woman and wore a black dress
and white apron.

52
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:32,140
She lived at Canterville Chase and looked
after the house.

53
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:36,230
'Welcome to Canterville Chase,' said Mrs Umney.

54
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:38,770
'Would you like some tea?'

55
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:41,990
'Yes, please,' said Mrs Otis.

56
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:45,680
The Otis family followed Mrs Umney into the
library.

57
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,010
There was a big table in the centre of the
room and many chairs.

58
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:55,510
Mrs Umney put teacups on the table, then she
brought a pot of tea.

59
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:59,230
The Otises sat in the library and drank their
tea.

60
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:02,450
They looked out of a large window at the rain.

61
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:06,580
The rain was falling heavily and the sky was
black.

62
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,940
They heard thunder and they saw lightning.

63
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:12,490
Mrs Otis looked around the room.

64
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:14,990
There were many books on bookshelves.

65
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:17,380
There were paintings on the walls.

66
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:20,790
There was also a red stain on the floor.

67
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:22,930
The red stain was by the fireplace.

68
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:25,830
'What is this red stain?'

69
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:28,530
Mrs Otis asked Mrs Umney.

70
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:33,210
'It is blood,' answered the old housekeeper
in a quiet voice.

71
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:37,949
'I don't want a blood-stain in my library,'
said Mrs Otis.

72
00:04:37,949 --> 00:04:39,440
'Please remove the stain.

73
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,860
Please clean the floor immediately.'

74
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,490
The old woman smiled.

75
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:48,050
'It is the blood of Lady Eleanore de Canterville.

76
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:54,370
She was murdered by her husband, Sir Simon
de Canterville, in 1575.

77
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:59,449
The blood-stain has been here for over three
hundred years.

78
00:04:59,449 --> 00:05:01,680
It cannot be removed.'

79
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,560
'Nonsense,' said Washington Otis.

80
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,830
'I have some Pinkerton's Stain Remover from
America.

81
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:09,780
It can remove any stain.

82
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:10,780
Watch.'

83
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:14,469
Washington Otis took the stain remover from
a bag.

84
00:05:14,469 --> 00:05:18,290
Pinkerton's Stain Remover looked like a small
black stick.

85
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:20,150
He rubbed the stick on the blood-stain.

86
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:23,860
A minute later the floor was clean.

87
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:28,270
The stick had removed the stain quickly and
easily.

88
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:30,610
Mrs Umney looked at the floor.

89
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:32,120
She was frightened.

90
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:36,690
No one had removed the blood-stain for three
hundred years.

91
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:40,199
Mrs Umney was very frightened.

92
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:43,120
'Pinkerton's can remove anything,' said Washington
Otis.

93
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:50,210
'The blood-stain has gone.'

94
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:53,030
Lightning flashed and lit the library.

95
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:55,780
Thunder crashed over the house.

96
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:58,030
Mrs Umney fainted.

97
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:01,060
Mr and Mrs Otis ran across the library.

98
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:04,360
They helped the old housekeeper who lay on
the floor.

99
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:08,389
Mrs Umney's eyes were closed and her face
was pale.

100
00:06:08,389 --> 00:06:10,060
'Mrs Umney!

101
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,240
Mrs Umney!'

102
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,729
cried Mrs Otis.

103
00:06:12,729 --> 00:06:14,400
'Can you speak?'

104
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,379
Mrs Umney opened her eyes.

105
00:06:17,379 --> 00:06:20,740
'Trouble will come to this house,' she said.

106
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:23,520
'I have seen the ghost.

107
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,389
The ghost will come to you.'

108
00:06:26,389 --> 00:06:29,430
All the Otises helped Mrs Umney to stand up.

109
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:33,319
'The ghost will come,' she said again.

110
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:35,479
'You must not remove the blood-stain.

111
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:38,979
You must not clean the library floor.

112
00:06:38,979 --> 00:06:41,539
The ghost will be angry.'

113
00:06:41,539 --> 00:06:44,219
Then Mrs Umney went upstairs to her room.

114
00:06:44,219 --> 00:06:47,849
'Let's look for the ghost,' said the Otis
boys.

115
00:06:47,849 --> 00:06:50,590
'Let's look round the house.'

116
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:53,669
The Otises looked round the house together.

117
00:06:53,669 --> 00:07:09,309
But they did not see the Canterville Ghost.

118
00:07:09,309 --> 00:07:12,210
That night the family went to bed early.

119
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:15,289
The storm continued all night.

120
00:07:15,289 --> 00:07:17,690
Next morning they went into the library.

121
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:21,449
The blood-stain had reappeared on the floor.

122
00:07:21,449 --> 00:07:25,539
'I'll remove this blood-stain once more,'
said Washington Otis.

123
00:07:25,539 --> 00:07:28,039
'Mother doesn't want a blood-stain in the
library.

124
00:07:28,039 --> 00:07:30,479
I'll clean the floor again.'

125
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:34,110
He removed the blood-stain with Pinkerton's
Stain Remover.

126
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:36,580
The library floor was clean.

127
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:39,919
But the next morning the stain had come back
again.

128
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:44,099
'This is very strange,' said Mr Otis.

129
00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:46,349
'I'll lock the library door at night.

130
00:07:46,349 --> 00:07:48,280
No one can come into the library.

131
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,689
No one can put a stain on the floor.'

132
00:07:50,689 --> 00:07:55,639
'I don't think Pinkerton's Stain Remover is
bad,' said Washington Otis.

133
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:57,990
'I think there really is a ghost.

134
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:00,110
The ghost is making the blood-stain.

135
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:03,569
The ghost puts the stain on the floor at night.'

136
00:08:03,569 --> 00:08:09,150
'We must find this ghost,' said Mr Hiram B.
Otis.

137
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:11,699
'It must stop making these stains.

138
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:15,770
Your mother does not like blood on the library
floor.'

139
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:18,319
That day the family went out.

140
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,780
They walked around the countryside near Canterville
Chase.

141
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,719
They went to the nearby village.

142
00:08:23,719 --> 00:08:26,419
They looked at the old village houses.

143
00:08:26,419 --> 00:08:29,939
Then they walked back to Canterville Chase
through the woods.

144
00:08:29,939 --> 00:08:36,339
It was a summer evening and the weather was
fine.

145
00:08:36,339 --> 00:08:39,030
It was late when they got back to the house.

146
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:42,290
The Otises were hungry and tired.

147
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:44,960
After eating supper they went to bed.

148
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,450
The bedrooms were upstairs.

149
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:49,730
There was a long corridor upstairs.

150
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:54,100
The bedroom doors were along this corridor.

151
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,690
Mr Otis woke up after midnight.

152
00:08:56,690 --> 00:09:00,700
There was a strange noise outside his room.

153
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:03,230
The sound was like metal chains.

154
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:06,590
The chains were nabbing together.

155
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:10,680
Mr Otis got out of bed and opened the bedroom
door.

156
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,290
He-looked into the corridor.

157
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:16,590
He saw the Canterville Ghost in the corridor.

158
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:21,490
The ghost was an old man with burning red
eyes.

159
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:25,690
He had long grey hair and wore very old-fashioned
clothes.

160
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:28,650
There were chains on his hands and feet.

161
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:32,910
He was rubbing the chains together so they
made a noise.

162
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:39,640
'My dear sir, your chains make a terrible
noise,' Mr Otis said to the ghost.

163
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,330
'You must put some oil on those chains.

164
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:46,060
Here is some Tammany Rising Sun Oil from the
United States.

165
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:49,020
Please put the oil on your chains.'

166
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:53,070
Mr Otis put a bottle of oil on a table in
the corridor.

167
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:58,660
Then he closed his bedroom door and went back
to bed.

168
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:01,970
The Canterville Ghost was very surprised.

169
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:06,650
He had lived in Canterville Chase for three
hundred years.

170
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:11,030
Everyone was frightened of him, because everyone
was afraid of ghosts.

171
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:14,570
But this American gentleman was not afraid.

172
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:17,780
The Canterville Ghost decided to work harder.

173
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:20,530
He wanted to frighten the American.

174
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:25,530
He made a terrible noise and shone a horrible
green light in the corridor.

175
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:29,200
Another door opened at the end of the corridor.

176
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,940
Mr Otis's youngest sons came out of their
bedroom.

177
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:37,240
The two young boys had the pillows from their
beds in their hands.

178
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,770
They threw the pillows at the ghost.

179
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:43,720
They laughed at the ghost.

180
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,420
The ghost was amazed and upset.

181
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:48,920
No one had laughed at him before.

182
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,780
He was a ghost.

183
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:53,100
Everyone is frightened of ghosts.

184
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:58,120
No one had ever laughed at the Canterville
Ghost before.

185
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:01,540
The Canterville Ghost did not know what to
do.

186
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:05,740
He disappeared through the wall and the house
became quiet.

187
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:08,760
The ghost went to the secret room where he
lived.

188
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,820
He sat down on a chair.

189
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:13,580
He thought about what had happened.

190
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:17,390
He had frightened people for three hundred
years.

191
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:20,680
He had looked through windows and frightened
the servants.

192
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,030
He had knocked on bedroom doors.

193
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:25,530
He had frightened people in their beds.

194
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:28,440
He had blown out candles in the night.

195
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:32,450
He had turned green and made noises with his
chains.

196
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:35,160
Everyone had always been frightened.

197
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:39,570
No one had given him Rising Sun Oil to put
on his chains.

198
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:42,330
No one had thrown pillows at him.

199
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:56,500
He was a very unhappy ghost.

200
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:01,810
Washington Otis removed the blood-stain in
the library every day.

201
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:04,840
Every morning the stain had reappeared.

202
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:08,230
But the stain was no longer the color of blood.

203
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:10,260
One morning it was brown.

204
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:12,200
Another morning it was purple.

205
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,780
Then it became bright green.

206
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:17,560
The Otises laughed at the blood-stain.

207
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:20,660
They looked for it every morning before breakfast.

208
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:24,220
'What color is it today?' asked Washington
Otis.

209
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,480
'It's green!'

210
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,730
shouted the twins.

211
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:29,090
'It's green blood today.'

212
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:33,860
They laughed at the green blood-stain on the
library floor.

213
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:36,060
Virginia Otis did not laugh.

214
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:38,930
The young girl was silent at breakfast.

215
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:43,890
The blood-stain made her feel sad and she
almost cried when she saw the bright green

216
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:44,890
stain.

217
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:48,130
She was sure that the ghost put the stain
on the floor.

218
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:50,240
She felt sorry for the ghost.

219
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,750
'The stain has been here for three hundred
years,' said Virginia.

220
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:57,440
'We have been here for three weeks.

221
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,420
The poor ghost puts the stain on the floor
every night.

222
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:03,220
Can't you leave the stain there?'

223
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:18,130
But the others did not listen to Virginia.

224
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:22,670
The second appearance of the ghost was on
a Sunday night.

225
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:25,040
The Otises had all gone to bed.

226
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,010
Suddenly they were woken up.

227
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:32,760
They heard a terrible crashing noise downstairs.

228
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:38,680
The whole family ran out of their bedrooms.

229
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,730
They ran downstairs.

230
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:45,700
It was dark but Mr Otis and his eldest son
carried candles.

231
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:54,690
They heard another crashing noise in the hallway
near the front door.

232
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:57,640
There was a suit of armor in the hallway.

233
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:01,430
This suit of armor was more than three hundred
years old.

234
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:04,810
It had fallen over and made a loud noise.

235
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:09,110
The Canterville Ghost was sitting on the floor
next to the armor.

236
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:12,900
The ghost had tried to put on the suit of
armor.

237
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:17,000
He wanted to walk around the house and frighten
the Otis family.

238
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,680
But the metal suit was too heavy.

239
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:23,160
The suit of armor had fallen onto the floor.

240
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:26,490
The Canterville Ghost was sitting beside the
armor.

241
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,190
He was rubbing his knee.

242
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:30,330
He had hurt himself.

243
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:34,180
Mr Hiram B. Otis pointed a gun at the ghost.

244
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:37,860
Washington Otis held his candle high in the
air.

245
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:41,230
The Otis twins laughed loudly.

246
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:44,230
Virginia was afraid and stood beside her mother.

247
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:49,130
They all looked at the Canterville Ghost.

248
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:51,350
The ghost was very angry.

249
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:54,130
He stood up and gave a loud shout.

250
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:57,190
He blew out the candle in Washington Otis's
hand.

251
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:59,090
There was no light in the hall.

252
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:02,090
Then the ghost ran up the stairs in the darkness.

253
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:05,330
He stopped at the top of the stairs and laughed.

254
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:07,790
He had a frightening laugh.

255
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:11,840
Men's hair had turned grey when they heard
him laugh.

256
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,390
But the Otises were not afraid.

257
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:17,760
'Are you in pain?' asked Mrs Otis.

258
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,480
'I have a bottle of Dr Dobell's medicine.

259
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,610
It is good for stomach-aches and headaches.

260
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:25,700
Please take the medicine.'

261
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:28,590
The ghost looked at Mrs Otis angrily.

262
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:33,700
Then he disappeared in a green cloud and went
back to his secret room.

263
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:36,050
He was very unhappy.

264
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:40,230
He had tried to put on the suit of armor,
but it was too heavy.

265
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:56,250
The armor had fallen over and the ghost had
hurt his leg.

266
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:59,280
The ghost stayed in his room during the day.

267
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:02,560
He came out at night to visit the library.

268
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,870
He repainted the blood-stain every night.

269
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:12,750
And every morning, Washington Otis removed
the blood-stain with Pinkerton's Stain Remover.

270
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:15,060
But the ghost had a problem.

271
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:17,940
He had quickly finished all his red paint.

272
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:21,770
Now his brown and purple paints were finished
as well.

273
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:27,420
So, sometimes he painted the blood-stain green,
sometimes blue.

274
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,620
The ghost made plans.

275
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:32,810
He wanted to frighten the Otis twins.

276
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:35,630
He planned to visit the twins in the night.

277
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:40,620
He planned to turn himself green and make
a horrible noise.

278
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:43,490
He planned to visit the twins in their bedroom.

279
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:48,460
He planned to touch them with his ice-cold
hands in the dark.

280
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:50,980
He left his secret room at midnight.

281
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:52,730
The house was dark.

282
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:56,390
He climbed the stairs and walked along the
corridor.

283
00:16:56,390 --> 00:17:00,730
The twins' bedroom was at the end of the corridor
round a corner.

284
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:02,810
He turned the corner.

285
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:05,100
Suddenly he stopped.

286
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:10,959
In front of him was a round face with a terrible
mouth and burning eyes.

287
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:15,309
Fire shone out of the mouth and eyes of this
horrible face.

288
00:17:15,309 --> 00:17:17,850
It was the face of a ghost!

289
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:22,319
The Canterville Ghost gave a shout and ran
back to his secret room.

290
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:28,289
He had never seen a ghost before and felt
very frightened.

291
00:17:28,289 --> 00:17:32,730
Before daylight came, the Canterville Ghost
felt better.

292
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:35,409
Were there two ghosts in the house?

293
00:17:35,409 --> 00:17:36,789
He must find out.

294
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:39,700
He must meet the second ghost.

295
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:44,789
He went back upstairs and walked along the
corridor towards the twins' room.

296
00:17:44,789 --> 00:17:49,760
The second ghost was still there, but its
eyes were no longer burning.

297
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,340
He went up to it.

298
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:53,019
He touched it.

299
00:17:53,019 --> 00:17:56,580
The head of the second ghost fell onto the
floor.

300
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,799
It was not a ghost at all.

301
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:03,759
It was a head made from a large round vegetable
called a pumpkin.

302
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:06,659
The twins had put a candle inside it.

303
00:18:06,659 --> 00:18:09,309
There was a card on the floor.

304
00:18:09,309 --> 00:18:14,870
THE OTIS GHOST THE ONLY TRUE CANTERVILLE GHOST

305
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:18,809
The twins had put the head in the corridor
to frighten him.

306
00:18:18,809 --> 00:18:22,179
This made the Canterville Ghost very angry.

307
00:18:22,179 --> 00:18:23,929
What could he do?

308
00:18:23,929 --> 00:18:38,850
He could think of nothing at that moment,
so he went back to his room.

309
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:41,990
The ghost felt very weak and tired.

310
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:45,059
He stayed in his room for five days.

311
00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:49,049
He did not repaint the blood-stain in the
library.

312
00:18:49,049 --> 00:18:53,400
There had been a blood-stain on the library
floor for three hundred years.

313
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:57,909
Now the library floor was clean.

314
00:18:57,909 --> 00:19:00,690
After a week the ghost felt better.

315
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:04,789
He decided to try once more to frighten the
Otis twins.

316
00:19:04,789 --> 00:19:08,830
He planned to make his face look as horrible
as possible.

317
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:11,889
He waited until the middle of the night.

318
00:19:11,889 --> 00:19:17,590
Slowly and silently he walked to the twins'
bedroom.

319
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:19,600
It was one o'clock in the morning.

320
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,580
The house was quiet.

321
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:25,860
The door of the twins' room was slightly open.

322
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:29,710
The ghost took off his head and carried it
under his arm.

323
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:33,110
It is terrifying to see a headless ghost.

324
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:35,780
He wanted to terrify the twins.

325
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:38,420
He pushed open the door of the twins' bedroom.

326
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:40,980
The door banged against the wall.

327
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:44,610
He had planned to shout and hold his head
in his hinds.

328
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:48,580
But a heavy jug of water fell from the top
of the door.

329
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:51,470
The twins had played a trick on him.

330
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:53,490
He was soaked with water.

331
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:56,299
The twins shouted and laughed.

332
00:19:56,299 --> 00:19:59,480
The ghost ran back down the corridor.

333
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:02,049
He could not frighten the twins.

334
00:20:02,049 --> 00:20:06,240
He could not frighten anyone in the Otis family.

335
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,880
Washington Otis came out of his bedroom.

336
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,730
The ghost stopped running.

337
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:13,820
Behind him, the twins ran down the corridor.

338
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:15,469
They shouted - 'Boo!'

339
00:20:15,469 --> 00:20:18,129
- in his ears and waved their arms.

340
00:20:18,129 --> 00:20:20,820
Washington Otis laughed at him.

341
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:24,080
The ghost did not know what to do.

342
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:29,200
He ran through the nearest door, went back
to the secret room and lay down.

343
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,249
He could not frighten anyone.

344
00:20:32,249 --> 00:20:47,649
He was a very unhappy ghost.

345
00:20:47,649 --> 00:20:51,749
The Otises did not see the Canterville ghost
at night again.

346
00:20:51,749 --> 00:20:54,499
The twins waited for him when it was dark.

347
00:20:54,499 --> 00:20:56,720
They put a rope across the corridor.

348
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,450
They tied metal tins to the rope.

349
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:02,549
But the ghost did not walk into the tins.

350
00:21:02,549 --> 00:21:05,210
Only Mr Otis came along the corridor.

351
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:09,220
He fell over the rope and was very angry.

352
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:12,250
Virginia Otis was also angry with the twins.

353
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:15,360
'Can't you leave the poor ghost alone?'

354
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,360
she said.

355
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,399
'Why do you want to hurt him?

356
00:21:18,399 --> 00:21:20,999
Why do you want to play tricks on him?

357
00:21:20,999 --> 00:21:23,980
He has lived here for a very long time.

358
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:25,799
Leave him alone.'

359
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:30,620
The twins did not listen, but the ghost heard
Virginia's words.

360
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:33,749
The words gave him hope.

361
00:21:33,749 --> 00:21:36,779
One afternoon, Virginia went to the library.

362
00:21:36,779 --> 00:21:39,470
The library door was slightly open.

363
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:44,230
She pushed the door wide open and quietly
walked into the room.

364
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:46,740
There was somebody sitting by the window.

365
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:49,470
It was the Canterville Ghost!

366
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:54,019
He was looking at the library window which
was made of colored glass.

367
00:21:54,019 --> 00:21:57,299
There were words painted on the glass.

368
00:21:57,299 --> 00:22:01,659
He was wearing his best clothes and had combed
his long grey hair.

369
00:22:01,659 --> 00:22:07,360
'I feel very sorry for you,' said Virginia
quietly.

370
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,940
'I'm sorry that my brothers were not very
kind to you.

371
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:13,379
But you did try to frighten them.'

372
00:22:13,379 --> 00:22:17,950
'Yes I did,' said the ghost.

373
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:23,240
'It is my job to frighten everyone who comes
to Canterville Chase.'

374
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:30,490
'You are very wicked, I know,' said Virginia,
'Mrs Umney, the housekeeper, told us that

375
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:31,759
you killed your wife.'

376
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:36,779
'Yes I did,' replied the ghost.

377
00:22:36,779 --> 00:22:38,510
'But she wasn't very kind.

378
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:44,909
And it wasn't very kind of her brothers to
starve me to death.'

379
00:22:44,909 --> 00:22:47,490
'Starve you to death?' said Virginia.

380
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:50,840
'Oh, poor ghost, are you hungry?

381
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,629
Would you like a sandwich?'

382
00:22:52,629 --> 00:22:56,409
'No thank you,' he replied.

383
00:22:56,409 --> 00:22:58,460
'I never eat anything.

384
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,820
But you are very kind.

385
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:04,139
You are much kinder than the rest of your
family.

386
00:23:04,139 --> 00:23:08,309
They are rude, nasty and unkind.'

387
00:23:08,309 --> 00:23:09,490
'Stop!'

388
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:10,980
cried Virginia.

389
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:13,669
'You are nasty and unkind too.

390
00:23:13,669 --> 00:23:15,950
You stole my paint box.

391
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:19,409
You used my paints to make the blood-stain
in the library.

392
00:23:19,409 --> 00:23:22,200
I never told anyone about it.

393
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,879
But now I'm going to fetch my father.'

394
00:23:24,879 --> 00:23:29,220
She turned to go, but the ghost spoke again.

395
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:33,019
'Please do not go, Miss Virginia,' said the
ghost.

396
00:23:33,019 --> 00:23:37,330
'I am so lonely and so unhappy.

397
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:40,299
I do not know what to do.

398
00:23:40,299 --> 00:23:44,909
I want to go to sleep and I cannot.'

399
00:23:44,909 --> 00:23:48,269
'It's easy to sleep,' said Virginia.

400
00:23:48,269 --> 00:23:50,119
'You go to bed and close your eyes.'

401
00:23:50,119 --> 00:23:56,360
'I have not slept for three hundred years,'
said the ghost.

402
00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:02,980
'I have not slept since I was murdered by
my wife's brothers.'

403
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:07,749
Virginia walked across the library and looked
at the old face of the ghost.

404
00:24:07,749 --> 00:24:10,289
It was a sad face.

405
00:24:10,289 --> 00:24:17,929
'Poor ghost,' said Virginia, 'how can I help
you to sleep?'

406
00:24:17,929 --> 00:24:24,110
'Far away in the woods,' said the ghost, 'there
is a little garden.

407
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:28,830
In the little garden the grass grows long
and thick.

408
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:32,191
There are many flowers and trees.

409
00:24:32,191 --> 00:24:35,850
A nightingale sings all night long.

410
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:41,659
The bird's sweet song is beautiful and sad.

411
00:24:41,659 --> 00:24:46,880
The white stars and the pale moon look down
on this little garden.

412
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,850
It is very peaceful.'

413
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:53,549
Virginia's eyes were full of tears.

414
00:24:53,549 --> 00:24:56,700
She put her hands over her face.

415
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:02,149
'You mean it is the Garden of Death,' she
said quietly.

416
00:25:02,149 --> 00:25:07,730
'Yes, the Garden of Sleep,' said the ghost.

417
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:09,860
'It is very beautiful.

418
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:12,640
There is peace and silence.

419
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,340
There is no yesterday and no tomorrow.

420
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:20,909
But only Love can open the door to the garden.

421
00:25:20,909 --> 00:25:25,330
For Love is stronger than Death.'

422
00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:28,009
Virginia did not know what to say.

423
00:25:28,009 --> 00:25:30,799
She listened as the ghost spoke again.

424
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:35,639
'Have you read the writing on the library
window?'

425
00:25:35,639 --> 00:25:41,029
'Yes,' said Virginia, 'but I do not understand
it.'

426
00:25:41,029 --> 00:25:43,330
'Look,' said the ghost.

427
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:47,419
'Read the lines on the window.'

428
00:25:47,419 --> 00:25:52,059
Virginia looked at the window and read the
lines of poetry:

429
00:25:52,059 --> 00:25:54,820
When a golden girl shall weep

430
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:57,929
For the ghost that cannot sleep,

431
00:25:57,929 --> 00:26:01,080
Then the dead at last shall die

432
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:04,489
And in restful earth may lie.

433
00:26:04,489 --> 00:26:11,489
'The words mean you must weep for me,' said
the unhappy ghost.

434
00:26:11,489 --> 00:26:15,739
'Then the Angel of Death will let me rest.

435
00:26:15,739 --> 00:26:16,929
Will you help?'

436
00:26:16,929 --> 00:26:21,639
'What do I have to do?' asked Virginia.

437
00:26:21,639 --> 00:26:24,960
'You must come with me into the darkness.

438
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,760
You will see strange things.

439
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:33,269
You will hear strange voices, but nothing
will hurt you.

440
00:26:33,269 --> 00:26:36,160
You are good and kind.

441
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:39,980
The dark cannot hurt you.'

442
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:43,519
Virginia did not answer and the ghost waited.

443
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:46,779
He had waited for three hundred years.

444
00:26:46,779 --> 00:26:50,019
This was the longest minute of all that time.

445
00:26:50,019 --> 00:26:54,239
'I am not afraid,' said Virginia at last.

446
00:26:54,239 --> 00:26:58,059
'I will come with you into the dark.'

447
00:26:58,059 --> 00:27:00,570
The ghost kissed her hand.

448
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:05,529
His lips were cold like ice, but they burned
like fire.

449
00:27:05,529 --> 00:27:10,360
The ghost held her hand and they walked to
the wall of the library.

450
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,570
The wall opened.

451
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:16,239
There was darkness beyond the wall and a cold
wind.

452
00:27:16,239 --> 00:27:19,330
Voices spoke out of the wind.

453
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:22,059
'Go back, Virginia.

454
00:27:22,059 --> 00:27:28,429
Go back before it is too late.'

455
00:27:28,429 --> 00:27:31,619
Virginia walked into the darkness with the
ghost.

456
00:27:31,619 --> 00:27:40,669
Virginia and the ghost disappeared through
the library wall.

457
00:27:40,669 --> 00:27:48,850
Virginia did not come downstairs for supper.

458
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:52,190
Mr Otis sent one of the servants to her room.

459
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:57,100
The servant could not find Virginia so everybody
searched the house.

460
00:27:57,100 --> 00:28:00,870
They looked everywhere but they could not
find her.

461
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:04,350
Mr and Mrs Otis were very worried.

462
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:09,980
It was a summer evening and the sun had not
set, so the family and the servants searched

463
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:13,009
the gardens before it was dark.

464
00:28:13,009 --> 00:28:16,970
In the garden there were many trees and a
deep pond.

465
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:18,779
They looked in the pond.

466
00:28:18,779 --> 00:28:20,960
They looked in the trees.

467
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,739
Then they asked people at the railway station.

468
00:28:23,739 --> 00:28:26,690
But no one had seen Virginia.

469
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:31,230
Mr Otis went to tell the village policeman
that Virginia had disappeared.

470
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:38,010
But, by that time, it was dark and no one
could search any more that night.

471
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:41,749
None of the family wanted to eat or sleep.

472
00:28:41,749 --> 00:28:44,879
They sat in the library and waited.

473
00:28:44,879 --> 00:28:48,340
They hoped Virginia would return safely.

474
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:53,899
They planned to search for Virginia again
in the morning.

475
00:28:53,899 --> 00:28:57,899
It was midnight when the family decided to
go to bed.

476
00:28:57,899 --> 00:29:02,960
They left the library and started to walk
up the stairs together.

477
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:09,679
Suddenly all the clocks in the house struck
twelve and they heard a terrible noise.

478
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:24,559
Thunder crashed outside the house and the
Otises heard a dreadful cry.

479
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:31,159
Strange music sounded inside the house and
a door opened at the top of the stairs.

480
00:29:31,159 --> 00:29:33,529
Virginia stood in the doorway.

481
00:29:33,529 --> 00:29:35,440
She looked down the stairs at them.

482
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:41,340
Her face was very pale and she carried a small
box in her hand.

483
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:43,629
'Where have you been?'

484
00:29:43,629 --> 00:29:45,480
Mr Otis asked angrily.

485
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:48,139
'Your mother has been very worried.

486
00:29:48,139 --> 00:29:49,869
You have frightened us all.

487
00:29:49,869 --> 00:29:52,080
You must never play a trick like this again.'

488
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:56,240
'Except on the ghost,' said the twins.

489
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,860
'You can play tricks on the ghost!'

490
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:05,340
'Father,' Virginia said quietly, 'I have been
with the ghost.

491
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:08,520
He is dead and now he can rest.

492
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:13,179
He gave me this box of beautiful jewels before
he died.'

493
00:30:13,179 --> 00:30:16,210
She showed her father the small box.

494
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:18,900
Inside was a necklace made of red stones.

495
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:22,659
'Where did you get this?' asked her father.

496
00:30:22,659 --> 00:30:25,570
'Where have you been?'

497
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:28,080
Mr Otis forgot to be angry.

498
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:31,659
He was so pleased to see that Virginia was
safe.

499
00:30:31,659 --> 00:30:32,830
'Come.

500
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:35,690
I'll show you,' said Virginia.

501
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:38,870
She turned back to the door at the top of
the stairs.

502
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:41,359
All of the family followed her.

503
00:30:41,359 --> 00:30:46,799
Washington Otis carried a lighted candle.

504
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:50,230
Virginia led them along a secret corridor.

505
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:54,070
They came to an old wooden door which was
open.

506
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:57,149
Beyond the door was a little room with a low
ceiling.

507
00:30:57,149 --> 00:31:02,100
There was an iron ring in the wall and two
chains.

508
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:05,559
At the end of the chains was a body.

509
00:31:05,559 --> 00:31:07,950
Only bones remained.

510
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:09,169
It was a skeleton.

511
00:31:09,169 --> 00:31:15,259
'This is the body of Sir Simon de Canterville,'
said Virginia.

512
00:31:15,259 --> 00:31:19,029
'He murdered his wife in 1575.

513
00:31:19,029 --> 00:31:22,450
Then his wife's brothers shut him in this
room.

514
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:24,669
He was given no food.

515
00:31:24,669 --> 00:31:27,559
Sir Simon starved to death.

516
00:31:27,559 --> 00:31:31,450
His ghost was in this house for three hundred
years.

517
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:34,679
But now he has found peace.'

518
00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:40,729
The Otis family looked around the little room
and did not know what to say.

519
00:31:40,729 --> 00:31:56,720
Virginia knelt on the floor beside the skeleton
and began to pray.

520
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,460
There was a funeral four nights later.

521
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:07,720
The Otises buried the body of Sir Simon de
Canterville in a grave among the trees.

522
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:13,899
The Otises, Mrs Umney the housekeeper, and
all the servants from Canterville Chase stood

523
00:32:13,899 --> 00:32:15,869
near the grave.

524
00:32:15,869 --> 00:32:19,679
Behind them were people from the nearby village.

525
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:22,960
Many people had come to the funeral.

526
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,549
Virginia carried white flowers.

527
00:32:25,549 --> 00:32:30,650
She looked up at the stars and the pale moon
and the dark trees.

528
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:35,879
She remembered what the ghost had said about
the Garden of Death.

529
00:32:35,879 --> 00:32:40,179
A nightingale began to sing.

530
00:32:40,179 --> 00:32:44,820
The bird's sweet song was beautiful and sad.

531
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:47,539
Virginia smiled.

532
00:32:47,539 --> 00:32:51,050
'God has forgiven him for murdering his wife,'
she said.

533
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:52,050
Hughie thanked him and looked at the envelope.

534
00:32:52,050 --> 00:32:53,050
These words were written on the envelope:
A wedding present to Hugh Erskine and Laura

535
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:54,050
Merton, from an old beggar.

536
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:55,050
Inside was a check for ten thousand pounds.

537
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:55,052
- THE END -
