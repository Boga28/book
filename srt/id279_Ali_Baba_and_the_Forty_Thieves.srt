00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:12,640
by Antoine Galland

3
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:15,521
OPEN SESAME

4
00:00:15,521 --> 00:00:20,641
Ali Baba was a woodcutter.

5
00:00:20,641 --> 00:00:25,681
He was from Persia, in the Middle East.

6
00:00:25,681 --> 00:00:37,081
One day he was at work in the woods when he saw forty men on
forty black horses.

7
00:00:37,081 --> 00:00:41,681
They stopped near a huge rock.

8
00:00:41,681 --> 00:00:52,162
They had forty big, heavy, brown sacks on their backs.

9
00:00:52,162 --> 00:01:00,362
Ali Baba watched the men as they got off their horses.

10
00:01:00,362 --> 00:01:15,683
A tall man walked to the rock and said "Open Sesame." Ali
Baba looked and looked again...

11
00:01:15,683 --> 00:01:23,243
Something amazing happened... the rock opened!

12
00:01:23,243 --> 00:01:28,723
Behind the rock was a cave.

13
00:01:28,723 --> 00:01:34,963
The forty men went into the cave with their sacks.

14
00:01:34,963 --> 00:01:45,004
Later, when the men came out of the cave, they didn't have
their sacks.

15
00:01:45,004 --> 00:01:55,324
"Close Sesame," said the tall man, and the rock closed!

16
00:01:55,324 --> 00:02:04,324
The forty men got on their horses and went away.

17
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:08,684
Ali Baba went to the rock.

18
00:02:08,684 --> 00:02:14,125
"Open Sesame," he said.

19
00:02:14,125 --> 00:02:27,125
The rock opened... and inside the cave there were hundreds
of sacks and wooden boxes.

20
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:34,645
Ali Baba opened a sack and... it was full of diamonds!

21
00:02:34,645 --> 00:02:45,406
He opened another sack and... it was full of gold coins!

22
00:02:45,406 --> 00:02:51,166
He opened a box and... it was full of silver!

23
00:02:51,166 --> 00:03:00,486
He opened another box and... it was full of beautiful
jewels!

24
00:03:00,486 --> 00:03:07,326
"These forty men are thieves," thought Ali.

25
00:03:07,326 --> 00:03:16,807
"I'm going to take some of these coins home for my wife!"

26
00:03:16,807 --> 00:03:25,087
He put some gold coins into his bag and went out of the
cave.

27
00:03:25,087 --> 00:03:28,927
"Close Sesame," he said.

28
00:03:28,927 --> 00:03:33,847
The rock closed and he went home.

29
00:03:33,847 --> 00:03:38,928
Ali Baba's wife, Nasreen, was in the kitchen.

30
00:03:38,928 --> 00:03:49,608
Ali Baba told her about the forty thieves and the treasure
in the cave.

31
00:03:49,608 --> 00:03:58,128
"This is wonderful news," said Nasreen.

32
00:03:58,128 --> 00:04:08,289
"Can we take more money and buy a new house and new
clothes?"

33
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:16,009
"Yes, but we mustn't tell anyone," said Ali.

34
00:04:16,009 --> 00:04:22,209
"The forty thieves are very dangerous men."

35
00:04:22,209 --> 00:04:31,129
Ali's brother, Cassim, was outside the kitchen.

36
00:04:31,129 --> 00:04:34,250
He opened the door.

37
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:42,610
"Tell me where the cave is!" he shouted.

38
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:52,690
"You must tell me or I'm going to go and look for it
myself!"

39
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:58,810
"No! Don't do that!" said Ali.

40
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:21,051
"Go into the woods. There's a huge rock near the big baobab tree. The rock opens when you say "Open Sesame" and closes
when you say "Close Sesame".

41
00:05:21,051 --> 00:05:33,932
Cassim went to the rock. "Open Sesame," he said. He went
into the cave and the rock closed.

42
00:05:33,932 --> 00:05:45,892
"This is amazing," thought Cassim. "Gold, silver...
beautiful jewels!"

43
00:05:45,892 --> 00:05:56,652
He had three big sacks with him and filled them with gold
and silver and jewels.

44
00:05:56,652 --> 00:06:08,293
He stood in front of the rock and said "Open Wheat", but the
rock didn't open!

45
00:06:08,293 --> 00:06:15,653
He said "Open Corn," but the rock didn't open!

46
00:06:15,653 --> 00:06:21,773
"Oh! What is the right word?" he thought.

47
00:06:21,773 --> 00:06:24,133
Cassim was angry.

48
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:29,093
He couldn't remember the word!

49
00:06:29,093 --> 00:06:36,174
He sat down to think, but suddenly he heard horses.

50
00:06:36,174 --> 00:06:40,814
The forty thieves were outside the cave!

51
00:06:40,814 --> 00:06:41,894
Look!

52
00:06:41,894 --> 00:06:44,974
A horse!

53
00:06:44,974 --> 00:06:47,374
Someone's in our cave!

54
00:06:47,374 --> 00:06:58,495
"He can't have our treasure! He must die!" said the tall
man.

55
00:06:58,495 --> 00:07:08,815
The next morning Cassim's wife, Zhila, went to Ali Baba.

56
00:07:08,815 --> 00:07:20,575
"Cassim didn't come home last night! Do you know where he
is?" she asked.

57
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:25,135
Ali told Zhila about the cave.

58
00:07:25,135 --> 00:07:38,176
"Please go to the cave! The thieves are dangerous men.
They'll kill him!" she said.

59
00:07:38,176 --> 00:07:43,376
Ali went to the rock.

60
00:07:43,376 --> 00:07:49,456
It was closed but he heard a noise.

61
00:07:49,456 --> 00:07:54,976
"Cassim, are you there?" he said.

62
00:07:54,976 --> 00:08:04,817
"Yes, yes... I'm here. Help me! I'm hurt."

63
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:15,697
"Open Sesame," said Ali Baba and the rock opened.

64
00:08:15,697 --> 00:08:21,217
Cassim was on the floor... he couldn't walk!

65
00:08:21,217 --> 00:08:30,978
"The thieves said I must die but I didn't die!" he said.

66
00:08:30,978 --> 00:08:44,738
"You didn't die but you're hurt! Let's go home now and the
doctor can come to the house later tonight."

67
00:08:44,738 --> 00:08:52,658
The next afternoon the thieves went back to the cave.

68
00:08:52,658 --> 00:08:59,379
"He isn't here!" said the tall man.

69
00:08:59,379 --> 00:09:12,299
"We must find him. He was hurt! We must find the doctor who
helped him!"

70
00:09:12,299 --> 00:09:17,459
The tall man found the doctor's house.

71
00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:20,299
He was angry.

72
00:09:20,299 --> 00:09:29,700
"Where's the man you helped yesterday? Where's his house?"
he asked.

73
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:34,860
"I don't know," said the doctor.

74
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:41,420
"It was dark and I couldn't see the road or the houses."

75
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:50,020
"Then take me to the house tonight when it's dark," said the
tall man.

76
00:09:50,020 --> 00:10:07,181
The, doctor took the tall man to Ali's house later that
night and the tall man painted a white cross on the door.

77
00:10:07,181 --> 00:10:15,261
"Now I know where Cassim and his family live," he thought.

78
00:10:15,261 --> 00:10:22,782
"They must all die! And I've got a plan!"

79
00:10:22,782 --> 00:10:33,342
The tall man went to the market and bought thirty-nine big
oil pots.

80
00:10:33,342 --> 00:10:42,862
"Put the pots on your horses then hide inside them" he told
the thieves.

81
00:10:42,862 --> 00:10:58,303
"I'm going to Ali Baba's house and you'll be in the pots.
We'll kill them all tonight when they are asleep!"

82
00:10:58,303 --> 00:11:03,223
That evening he went to Ali Baba's house.

83
00:11:03,223 --> 00:11:21,904
"Good evening. I'm an oil merchant from India and I'm very tired," he said "Have you got a room where I can sleep and a
place for my horses?"

84
00:11:21,904 --> 00:11:29,504
"Of course! Welcome to my home," said Ali.

85
00:11:29,504 --> 00:11:33,424
Zhila was in the kitchen with Nasreen.

86
00:11:33,424 --> 00:11:42,184
"That man isn't Indian; he's Persian," said Zhila.

87
00:11:42,184 --> 00:11:53,865
"I don't like him. Let's go and look at the pots on his
horses."

88
00:11:53,865 --> 00:11:59,985
They went out of the house into the garden.

89
00:11:59,985 --> 00:12:07,785
There were lots of stars in the sky and everything was very
quiet.

90
00:12:07,785 --> 00:12:18,146
Suddenly they heard a man's voice: "When are we going to
kill Cassim and AliBaba and their wives?"

91
00:12:18,146 --> 00:12:18,146
"When they're asleep," said another voice.

92
00:12:18,146 --> 00:12:18,146
The women looked at the pots on the horses.

93
00:12:18,146 --> 00:12:18,146
Thirty-nine pots in their garden... thirty-nine men in the
pots, and one man in the house...

94
00:12:18,146 --> 00:12:18,146
The Forty Thieves!

95
00:12:18,146 --> 00:12:18,146
"Quickly!" said Zhila.

96
00:12:18,146 --> 00:12:18,146
"Open the gate."

97
00:12:18,146 --> 00:12:18,146
Nasreen opened the gate.

98
00:12:18,146 --> 00:12:18,146
"Shoo, shoo, go away! Shoo, shoo, go away!" they shouted at
the horses.

99
00:12:18,146 --> 00:12:18,146
The horses ran out of the garden.

100
00:12:18,146 --> 00:12:18,146
They ran and they ran and they ran.

101
00:12:18,146 --> 00:12:18,146
They ran into the desert and never came back.

102
00:12:18,146 --> 00:12:18,146
The tall man went into the garden when everyone was
sleeping.

103
00:12:18,146 --> 00:12:18,146
His horses weren't there!

104
00:12:18,146 --> 00:12:18,146
His pots weren't there!

105
00:12:18,146 --> 00:12:18,146
His men weren't there!

106
00:12:18,146 --> 00:12:18,146
He ran out of the garden, he ran into the desert, but he
couldn't see his horses or his men.

107
00:12:18,146 --> 00:12:18,146
He ran and he ran and he ran and he never came back.

108
00:12:18,146 --> 00:12:18,146
In the morning Cassim and Ali Baba woke up early and went
into the garden.

109
00:12:18,146 --> 00:12:18,146
"This is very strange," said Ali.

110
00:12:18,146 --> 00:12:18,146
The oil merchant isn't here, and his horses aren't here!

111
00:12:18,146 --> 00:12:18,146
Where are they?"

112
00:12:18,146 --> 00:12:18,146
"You men are very silly," said Nasreen.

113
00:12:18,146 --> 00:12:18,146
"Yes, very silly," said Zhila.

114
00:12:18,146 --> 00:12:18,146
"The oil merchant from India wasn't an oil merchant from
India."

115
00:12:18,146 --> 00:12:18,146
"No," said Nasreen.

116
00:12:18,146 --> 00:12:18,146
"He was the leader of the forty thieves!"

117
00:12:18,146 --> 00:12:18,146
"Where are the forty thieves now?" said Cassim.

118
00:12:18,146 --> 00:12:18,146
"They ran into the desert, and let's hope they'll never come
back!" said Zhila.

119
00:12:18,146 --> 00:12:18,146
"Tomorrow you can go and get the treasure and we'll give
some to everyone in the village!"

120
00:12:18,146 --> 00:12:18,146
The next day Cassim and Ali Baba went back to the rock with
ten grey donkeys.

121
00:12:18,146 --> 00:12:18,146
"Open Wheat," said Cassim.

122
00:12:18,146 --> 00:12:18,146
"No, silly! Don't you remember? It's not Wheat. It's
Sesame!" said Ali Baba.

123
00:12:18,146 --> 00:12:18,146
"Of course, the word is "Sesame". Open Sesame," said Cassim.

124
00:12:18,146 --> 00:12:18,146
The rock opened and they put all the wooden boxes and sacks
of treasure on the donkeys.

125
00:12:18,146 --> 00:12:18,146
Then they went back to the village and gave the treasure to
the poor villagers.

126
00:12:18,146 --> 00:12:18,146
"Thank you, Nasreen and Zhila" said the villagers.

127
00:12:18,146 --> 00:12:18,186
"You're very clever women!"
