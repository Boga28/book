CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,000
A night out at Maxim's

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,440
Jennifer looked at the clock 
on the waiting-room wall.  

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:17,440
Nearly half-past eight. The light 
was still on in Doctor Gibson's room.  

5
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:25,200
I'm going to be late, she said to 
herself, why doesn't he hurry up?  

6
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:33,120
The evening surgery was always busy on 
Thursdays but tonight was worse than usual.

7
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,840
She quickly put the newspapers in a cupboard.  

8
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,840
Then she took off her white coat 
and locked it in the cupboard too.  

9
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:54,960
She was turning off the lights when someone rang 
the front doorbell. Oh no, not another patient,  

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:07,520
not at this hour. She ran to the door and opened 
it. Outside it was dark but she could see a man,  

11
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:16,880
his hands deep in his pockets. He moved 
his head and the light fell on his face.

12
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:25,840
'Richard!' she cried in surprise. 
'What are you doing here?'

13
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,760
'Can I come in for a minute?'

14
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:37,280
He did not wait for an answer but pushed 
past her and went inside. Jennifer  

15
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:44,640
turned to him. She was usually pleased when 
Richard called, but this was the wrong time.  

16
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:54,160
'I'm sorry, but you can't stay. I must hurry. 
I'm meeting my friend Claire for dinner  

17
00:01:54,160 --> 00:02:03,040
and...' She stopped. It was Richard's 
eyes - they looked tired and worried.

18
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,840
'What's the matter?' she asked.

19
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:16,880
Just then Dr Gibson called from his room. 'Did I 
hear the doorbell, Nurse? Was it another patient?'

20
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,280
'No, it's only my brother 
Richard,' she called back.

21
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:31,440
She turned back to Richard. 'Is 
something wrong?' she asked again.

22
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:43,440
He shook his head. 'I'm fine,' he said. 'It's 
just... well, I had some trouble at work.'

23
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,200
'Trouble?'

24
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:56,080
'It was nothing, really. I said something to my 
boss and he didn't like it. He got angry with me  

25
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:04,160
and... and in the end he told 
me to go. So I've lost my job.'

26
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:08,480
'Oh Richard, not again! Why 
do you do these things?'  

27
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:18,160
Jennifer was beginning to feel cross with 
him. 'And now you have no money, is that it?'

28
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:24,000
'Take it easy, Jenny. I don't need 
very much. Only twenty pounds.  

29
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:32,320
I'll pay you back next week - really 
I will.' He put his hand on her arm.  

30
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:40,800
'You can do that for me, can't you? 
Just twenty pounds. It's for a present.'

31
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:52,560
'Yes, I know, I know. A present for a very special 
girl - like the last one. And the one before.'  

32
00:03:54,960 --> 00:04:00,240
Jennifer knew her young brother well 
and she was often angry with him,  

33
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:06,800
but she could never say no to him. She 
opened her bag, took out some money  

34
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:13,840
and gave it to him. 'But remember, 
I want it back next week.'

35
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:22,720
Richard smiled and put his arm around his 
sister. 'Thanks, Jenny. This is different.  

36
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:30,320
Really! She's very, very special. But 
you're in a hurry so I'll go now.'

37
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:38,400
'Don't forget,' she called after 
him. 'Next week. Twenty pounds.'

38
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:46,240
Maxim's restaurant was busy - 
young men and women from offices,  

39
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:52,800
several older people, a group of 
students, and a few theatre people.  

40
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,920
Jennifer looked around for her friend. 
Claire usually sat near the window  

41
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:09,840
but tonight she was not there. Somebody was having 
a party and all the tables on that side were full.  

42
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:20,080
Then Jennifer heard Claire's voice behind her. 
'Did you get lost? I've been here for hours.'

43
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:29,760
'I know I'm late,' Jennifer said, 
'and I am sorry. Today has been  

44
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:37,600
really busy. The last patient didn't leave 
until eight-thirty. And then I had a visit  

45
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:44,560
from Richard. He wanted to borrow some 
money. He always wants to borrow money.'

46
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:53,360
They went to an empty table. A waiter 
came up to them and took their orders.  

47
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:02,080
At that moment there was a cheer from the 
party beside the window. An older man in  

48
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:09,920
a light grey suit was standing up. He spoke 
for a few minutes and then held up his glass.  

49
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:19,120
All the others stood up, and looked at a young 
girl with large gold ear-rings, who was sitting in  

50
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:28,240
the chair next to him. Everyone was laughing, and 
then they began to sing 'Happy birthday to you'.  

51
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:37,600
They were all looking at the girl, but she herself 
just sat there without a smile on her face.  

52
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:48,240
The song came to an end, and there was another 
loud cheer and more laughing and shouting.  

53
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,440
Someone called out 'Twenty-one today,  

54
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:58,160
twenty-one today...', and this time 
everyone in the restaurant sang too.

55
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,040
Suddenly there was a loud crash.  

56
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:10,320
Then someone screamed and a voice 
shouted, 'Bring a towel - quickly.'

57
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,720
The man in the grey suit 
was lying across the table.  

58
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:25,680
He was holding his face, which was red with 
blood. On the table there was broken glass.

59
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:35,280
Someone said in a loud voice, 'What 
happened - did he fall?' Several  

60
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,680
people were speaking at the same 
time. 'It's his heart, you know...'

61
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,840
'Joe's been in and out of hospital for years...'

62
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,960
'His head hit those glasses'.

63
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,840
The man was still lying across the table.  

64
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:58,000
Jennifer jumped up, and both 
she and Claire ran over to him.

65
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,840
'We're nurses,' said Jennifer. 'Can we help?'

66
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:12,960
There was a cut on the side of the man's 
face. It was deep and he was losing  

67
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:22,880
a lot of blood. A waiter ran up with a towel. 
Jennifer took it and held it to the cut.  

68
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:29,840
The man's mouth was open and 
he was making strange noises.

69
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:40,800
'He needs a doctor. We'll have to get him to 
hospital,' Jennifer said. She turned to Claire.  

70
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,640
'You came here in your car, didn't you?'

71
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:50,720
'Yes, come on - we'll take him,' Claire replied.

72
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,920
They helped the man outside 
and put him in Claire's car.  

73
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:08,320
Jennifer jumped in beside him and they drove off. 
She was still holding the towel to the man's face.  

74
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:14,640
The blood was not coming so fast now and 
he was beginning to feel a little better.

75
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:24,000
'Where... where are we going?' he 
asked. 'Are you taking me home?'

76
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:36,800
'Just stay there and don't speak,' Jennifer 
told him. 'You fell and hurt yourself. You'll  

77
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:44,240
be all right, but you must see a doctor. 
We'll be at the hospital in a few minutes.'

78
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:55,840
At the word 'hospital' the man immediately 
tried to sit up. 'No, no,' he said angrily,  

79
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:06,960
'I don't need to go to hospital. I'm feeling 
better now. Just take me home. And who are you?'

80
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:14,960
'I'm a nurse,' Jennifer told him. 
'And you need to see a doctor.  

81
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:22,720
We're nearly there now. Just 
sit still - and stop talking.'

82
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:32,240
But the man was feeling stronger now and he would 
not be quiet. He pulled at Jennifer's arm and said  

83
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:43,280
loudly, 'I don't need a doctor. It's just a small 
cut on my face. I'm all right now. Take me home!'  

84
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:53,680
When Jennifer did not answer him, he said in 
a quieter voice. 'Come on now - listen to me.  

85
00:10:54,800 --> 00:11:03,840
I'm feeling fine, really I am. There's no need 
to take me to hospital. They'll want to keep me  

86
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:14,720
there - they always do, because of my bad heart. 
You see, I have to meet some business people the  

87
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:23,680
day after tomorrow - it's very important. So 
just stop the car and I can get a taxi home.'  

88
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:34,640
By now the car was at the door of the hospital. A 
nurse came to meet them and while Claire told her  

89
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:43,920
about the accident, Jennifer helped the man out of 
the car. He said something angrily to the nurse,  

90
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:53,120
but after a few seconds he went with her into 
the hospital. Jennifer and Claire drove away.

91
00:11:54,880 --> 00:12:05,760
'What a difficult man!' said Claire crossly. 'No 
"Thank you for your help" or "You're very kind".'

92
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:11,760
'Some people never say thank you,' Jennifer said.

93
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,840
'Don't worry about it.'

94
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:21,440
When they got back to Maxim's, a 
police car was standing outside,  

95
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:27,040
with its blue light on. There 
was a small group of people  

96
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:35,600
around the door. Jennifer pushed through them, 
Claire behind her. They tried to go inside.  

97
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:45,600
A policeman moved forward and put up his arm. 
'You'll have to wait here,' he told them.

98
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:54,000
'But we ordered dinner... and we 
haven't eaten yet,' said Claire.

99
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:02,560
But the policeman was not listening to 
them. He was looking through the glass door.  

100
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:09,440
Something was happening inside 
and people were moving about.  

101
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:17,760
Then one of Maxim's waiters opened 
the door and two policemen came out.  

102
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:26,800
They were holding a young girl between them. 
It was the girl from the birthday party,  

103
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:33,840
the girl with the unhappy face 
and the expensive gold ear-rings.  

104
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:41,200
The police pushed her into the back 
of their car and drove away quickly.

105
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:53,200
Jennifer and Claire looked at each other. What 
an evening! They waited two or three minutes,  

106
00:13:54,240 --> 00:14:01,840
but the restaurant door was closed now and the 
policeman was standing in front of it again.

107
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:08,960
Neither of them felt hungry anymore. 
They walked slowly towards the car.  

108
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:20,160
Claire was the first to speak. 'Come on, Jenny, 
let's enjoy ourselves - we're having a night out.'  

109
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,920
Jennifer did not speak.

110
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:35,440
Claire went on, 'Do you remember Maxim's 
little song on TV?' She began to sing:

111
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,880
Come where the music's wonderful,

112
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,600
Come where the food is fine.

113
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,200
Let's all meet at Maxim's,

114
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,520
We'll have a wonderful time.

115
00:14:49,360 --> 00:15:00,720
She stopped. Jennifer was not pleased. 'All this 
is not really my idea of a wonderful time,' she  

116
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:09,440
said. 'I'm tired and I wanted a nice quiet 
evening, a good meal, and an early night.'

117
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:16,560
'Come on,' Claire replied. 
'Let's go to another restaurant.'

118
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:26,000
'No, let's leave it till next 
week. I'll just walk home now.'

119
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:32,880
They said goodbye. Claire got into her 
car and called, 'See you next week, then.'

120
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:43,920
Jennifer walked slowly home. She felt unhappy 
and worried - worried about her young brother,  

121
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:49,600
Richard. She remembered his visit 
to the surgery earlier that evening.  

122
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:55,840
He was always in and out of 
jobs, and never had any money.  

123
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:03,760
A year ago he had a little trouble with the 
police, but Richard did not worry about it.  

124
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:12,240
He never worried about anything! He just laughed, 
and came to Jennifer to ask for more money.  

125
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,920
Both their parents were dead, and there 
were no other brothers or sisters.  

126
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:25,600
So Jennifer, fifteen years older than 
Richard, worried about her brother a lot.

127
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:35,840
She went past a jewellery shop with its lights on, 
and stopped to look in the window for a minute.  

128
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:44,560
She saw some ear-rings and then remembered 
the gold ear-rings on the girl at Maxim's.  

129
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:53,920
They were large and looked very expensive - 
and they looked all wrong next to that small  

130
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:59,280
unhappy face. Where did she get them?  

131
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:06,880
Jennifer smiled to herself. Perhaps the 
police were asking that question now.
 
 

132
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:13,920
CHAPTER TWO

133
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,840
A visit from the police

134
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:26,960
Jennifer did not sleep well that night. 
She woke up feeling tired and unhappy.  

135
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:33,840
When she arrived at Dr Gibson's surgery, 
she looked into the waiting-room.  

136
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:41,760
It was nearly full. Another busy 
morning, she said to herself.  

137
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:51,440
Just then she heard the doctor's car outside. 
He hurried in and went into his room.

138
00:17:53,600 --> 00:18:01,600
Three hours later he finished with his last 
patient. Jennifer brought a cup of coffee  

139
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:09,280
and put it on Dr Gibson's desk. He 
said thanks and she turned to go.

140
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:21,920
'Er - just a minute,' he called after her, 'I 
want a word with you.' He sounded a little cross.  

141
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:32,080
'There was a phone call for you this morning 
- about an hour ago. You were busy at the time  

142
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:33,840
so I answered it.'

143
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,760
'Oh, who was it?'

144
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,920
'Let me see - I wrote it down somewhere.' 
He began to move the papers on his desk.  

145
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,720
'She said that she was a 
friend of your brother's.'

146
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,400
'My brother? But why did she want me?'

147
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:03,840
'Ah, here it is.' He gave 
Jennifer a piece of paper.  

148
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:13,440
On it was a name - Wendy. 'She didn't leave 
a number. She'll call you again at home.'

149
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:23,840
Jennifer looked at the name. Wendy?... 
Wendy who? she asked herself.

150
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,600
'Thank you, Dr Gibson,' she said.

151
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:34,320
'And tell her, please, no phone 
calls during surgery hours.'

152
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,560
'I'm sorry. It won't happen again.'  

153
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:46,800
Jennifer wanted to explain that she did 
not know this Wendy but decided not to.  

154
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:55,440
A few minutes later Dr Gibson shouted 
goodbye to her and Jennifer was alone.  

155
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:04,320
She knew a few of Richard's friends 
but nobody called Wendy. But Richard  

156
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:12,240
changed his girlfriends as often as his shirts! 
Jennifer did not try to remember all their names.

157
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:20,320
At the end of the day Jennifer arrived at her flat  

158
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:28,560
and was going up the stairs when she heard voices 
above. Two men were standing outside her door.  

159
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:39,280
One of them came up to her. 'Miss 
Walton?' he asked. 'My name's Detective  

160
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:44,720
Barrett. I'd like to ask you a few 
questions, please. Can we come in?'

161
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,160
She turned the key in the 
lock and pushed open the door,  

162
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,240
and all three of them went inside and sat down.

163
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:03,920
'It's about Mr Richard Walton. He's 
your brother, I think,' Barrett began.  

164
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:09,520
He spoke softly but he had a hard voice,  

165
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:20,240
cold and unfriendly, and his light blue eyes never 
left Jennifer's face. 'When did you last see him?'

166
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,360
Jennifer told him.

167
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:30,080
'And before that?'

168
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:34,320
'I'm not sure - about three or four weeks ago.'

169
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:42,400
Those light blue eyes were still on her. 
She was beginning to feel uncomfortable.

170
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:47,840
'You didn't see him last weekend, then?'

171
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:50,320
'No.'

172
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:59,200
'Try to remember - did he come here 
last Saturday? In the evening?'

173
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:01,360
'No.'

174
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,120
'You're sure?'

175
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,960
'Yes, of course I'm sure.'

176
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:14,960
Barrett's voice became a little louder. 
'You didn't meet him in some other place?  

177
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,600
At the airport perhaps?'

178
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:25,840
'No, I didn't. I haven't seen him for nearly a 
month, I tell you. Until last night, I mean.'

179
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:35,280
'Last night...' Barrett said after 
her. 'Tell us more about last night.  

180
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,920
You took a man to hospital... 
from Maxim's restaurant.'

181
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,000
'Yes.'

182
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,760
'A friend of yours?'

183
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:54,240
'I never saw him in my life before. 
He fell and hurt himself. They said  

184
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:59,680
that he had a bad heart so I went to 
the hospital with him. That's all.'

185
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:09,440
'You never saw him before? You 
surprise me, Miss Walton.' Barrett  

186
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:17,360
was watching her carefully. 'You didn't know 
that he was Mr Joe Kelly, your brother's boss?'

187
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:19,840
'No, I didn't.'

188
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:27,040
'Really? You didn't know him? 
Very strange, don't you think?'

189
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:38,720
All these questions - she was feeling angry now. 
She stood up and went across to Barrett. 'Look,  

190
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:48,240
Detective Barrett, I'm getting tired of this. 
What's it all about? You want me to answer your  

191
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:57,360
questions and you don't tell me why. What's the 
matter - I want to know. Is Richard in trouble?'

192
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:06,960
Barrett held up his hands. 'All right, 
take it easy.' He gave a little smile  

193
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:12,720
but his eyes were cold and he was 
still looking hard at Jennifer.  

194
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:17,840
The other detective said 
some-thing quietly to Barrett.  

195
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:25,280
Then Barrett went on, 'Your brother - 
what do you know about his girlfriend?'

196
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,840
'His girlfriend?'

197
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:34,400
'Yes, Wendy. He works with her at Joe Kelly's.'

198
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:40,560
Wendy! The mystery telephone 
call at the surgery that morning!  

199
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:50,880
Jennifer tried to hide her surprise. She 
looked first at Barrett, then at the other man.  

200
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:59,840
Then she said coldly, 'Richard doesn't 
talk to me about his girlfriends.'

201
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:07,520
'He's told you about Wendy, I'm sure. 
They're very friendly, the two of them.  

202
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:16,000
They went to Germany together.' He turned 
to the other man. 'Last weekend, wasn't it?'

203
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:22,800
The second detective moved a little 
nearer and spoke quietly to Barrett.  

204
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:29,440
'She doesn't know anything about this. 
You'll have to explain it to her.'

205
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:39,680
Barrett turned to Jennifer again. 'We're looking 
for some stolen jewellery, from Germany. And we  

206
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:47,760
believe that your brother knows something about 
it. You won't like this, Miss Walton, but your  

207
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:56,160
brother works for a criminal, a thief, and one of 
these days he's going to find himself in trouble.'

208
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,120
'But my brother lost his job yesterday.  

209
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:07,120
He told me last night. So he 
doesn't work for this man anymore.'

210
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:16,400
Barrett smiled. 'Perhaps he doesn't... 
or perhaps he wants people to think  

211
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:23,840
that he doesn't work for Kelly.' He went on. 'If 
you don't want to see your brother in prison,  

212
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:31,600
tell him to keep away from Kelly. And 
from beautiful young girls like Wendy.'

213
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:38,080
Jennifer looked at him and said nothing.

214
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:44,720
Barrett stood up. He looked at the other 
man and they both moved to the door.  

215
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,280
Jennifer followed and opened it for them.

216
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:55,200
'Good night, Miss Walton. Thanks for your help.'

217
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:03,280
They walked to the top of the stairs. 
Jennifer waited for a few seconds,  

218
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,800
then went inside and closed the door.

219
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:19,840
Oh Richard, she thought. What is happening? What 
are you doing? Why can't you stay out of trouble?

220
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,440
She telephoned Richard's 
flat, but there was no answer.  

221
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:34,080
So she went to bed, and worried half 
the night about her young brother.

222
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:42,240
The next day, Saturday, she worked only in the 
morning. When Dr Gibson's surgery finished,  

223
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:50,560
she went home to have lunch. Then she planned 
to go round to Richard's flat and talk to him.  

224
00:27:52,480 --> 00:28:02,000
But when she got into her flat, the telephone was 
ringing. She ran across the room and answered it.

225
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:08,000
'Hello, is that Jennifer Walton?' 
someone asked. It was a girl's voice.

226
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,400
'Yes, Jennifer here. Who's speaking?'

227
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:20,320
The caller was silent for a second or 
two, then said, 'You don't know me,  

228
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:27,760
but I'm a friend of your brother's. Are 
you free just now? I need to see you.  

229
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:35,360
It's important.' She went on quickly. 
'I'm just round the corner from your flat.  

230
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:43,840
Can I come up? I'll be there in three 
minutes.' And she put the phone down.

231
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:51,520
Jennifer was waiting at the door when her 
visitor arrived. She looked at her in surprise.  

232
00:28:52,720 --> 00:29:00,640
She knew that face. It was the young girl from 
Maxim's, but without the gold ear-rings today.

233
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:08,720
The girl was also surprised. 'I saw 
you at Maxim's on Thursday night,'  

234
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:17,520
she said. 'You took Joe Kelly to hospital. 
Are you Jennifer, Richard's sister?'

235
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,200
'Yes,' said Jennifer.  

236
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:30,240
She looked at her visitor, and began to put 
two and two together. 'And you must be Wendy.'

237
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,840
'Yes,' the girl said.

238
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:45,120
Jennifer stood back, and the girl went inside. 
They sat down and Jennifer looked at the girl  

239
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:53,840
coldly. So this was Richard's girlfriend... 
who worked for the criminal, Joe Kelly.  

240
00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:03,040
She had a beautiful little face and looked very 
unhappy, but Jennifer did not want to like her.

241
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,640
'What do you want to see me about?' she asked.

242
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:18,080
'It's difficult to explain,' the girl began. 
She looked unhappily at Jennifer's unfriendly  

243
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:28,320
face. 'You see, Richard has told me about you. He 
says that you're very kind... you always help him.  

244
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,320
He gave me your phone numbers and said...'  

245
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:41,040
She stopped, and Jennifer waited. 'He 
said that I could ask you for help.'

246
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:48,320
Jennifer smiled to herself. 
Always the kind big sister,  

247
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:52,800
she thought. She looked at the 
girl's small, worried face.

248
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:58,240
'Well, go on, then,' she said more kindly.  

249
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:03,840
'Tell me all about it. I hope 
that Richard's not in trouble.'

250
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:09,040
'You see, I work for Joe Kelly,'  

251
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:16,480
Wendy began. She talked for a long 
time, and Jennifer listened carefully.

252
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,600
This was Wendy's story.
 
 

253
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:24,880
CHAPTER THREE

254
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,200
Wendy's story

255
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:36,960
Kelly is not a nice man, and I've never liked 
him. I've worked for him for a year now.  

256
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:45,840
My father got the job for me - he told 
me to work hard and not to ask questions.  

257
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:56,160
Kelly often gets angry, and when he's angry, he 
shouts at everyone and his face goes very red.  

258
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:02,080
I'm afraid of him, but I 
don't want to lose my job.  

259
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:07,920
I need the money and it's 
not easy to find another job.

260
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,840
Richard started work at Kelly's about a month ago.  

261
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:22,720
We're good friends, but we don't talk much about 
our jobs. Nobody at Kelly's talks about the work.  

262
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:33,120
We don't really know what his business is. He 
has two garages in the town and he buys and  

263
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:42,960
sells old cars. But he also buys and sells a lot 
of other things, too - furniture, old pictures,  

264
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:50,960
jewellery. I think that some of these things 
are stolen, but I don't ask questions.

265
00:32:53,520 --> 00:33:04,080
Ten days ago Kelly called me into his office. I 
stood there and waited. He began to say something  

266
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:13,120
to me, but he stopped and looked down at his 
papers. Then he took out his diary and opened it.

267
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:18,080
'Wendy, what are you doing next weekend?'

268
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,880
'I'm not sure, Mr Kelly.'

269
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:27,760
'How would you like to go on a little business 
trip? I'll pay you for it, of course.'

270
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:33,440
This surprised me, and I 
did not reply immediately.  

271
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:38,160
Then I said, 'A business trip, Mr Kelly?'

272
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:42,800
'Yes, to Germany... just for the day.  

273
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:49,040
It isn't a difficult job but 
it's important. What do you say?'

274
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,760
I did not know much about Mr Kelly's business,  

275
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:59,680
but I did know that there was something strange 
about these journeys to other countries.  

276
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:07,920
They happened every two or three months, and after 
them there were secret meetings in the office,  

277
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:14,000
often late in the evening. I 
decided that I did not want to go.

278
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:22,880
'But... but I've never been to 
Germany. Don't you think... well,  

279
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,760
perhaps you can ask one of the others.'

280
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:34,880
'I'm asking you, Wendy. I said that it 
was important and I want you to do it.'  

281
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:44,720
I began to say something but he was still 
speaking. 'I have friends in Frankfurt and  

282
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:52,000
they want to send me some things. They'll 
give you three small boxes, like egg boxes,  

283
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:58,480
and you'll bring them back here. There's 
nothing difficult about that, is there?'

284
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,840
I didn't say anything.

285
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:10,320
'Are you listening to me, Wendy?' he 
asked. 'I need you to do this job for me.'  

286
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,520
His voice was getting louder now.

287
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:22,640
I looked him in the face. 'I'm... I'm 
sorry, Mr Kelly. I've just remembered.  

288
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,560
I'm busy next weekend. I can't do it.'

289
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:35,120
He jumped up and his chair fell back. 
'Now, just you listen to me, young woman.  

290
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:44,800
You work for me, remember that. I'm the person 
who pays you.' He caught my arm and shook me.  

291
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:54,160
This time I'm telling you, not asking you. 
You'll go to Frankfurt or there'll be trouble.  

292
00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:02,800
You will leave on the first plane on Saturday 
morning and come back the same evening. With  

293
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:09,920
the three boxes. And don't say a 
word to anyone, do you understand?'

294
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:12,880
Then he walked out.

295
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:23,040
I didn't sleep much that night. Or the next. I 
wanted to tell Richard but he was out of town  

296
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:32,000
on another of Kelly's jobs. What could I do? I 
was afraid, and Kelly knew that I was afraid.  

297
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:37,440
He did not speak about it again but on Friday  

298
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:45,120
he called me into his office and gave me my 
plane ticket and some money. There was no escape.

299
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:50,800
Saturday morning came, and I went to the airport.  

300
00:36:52,320 --> 00:37:03,600
While I was waiting there, I heard my name. I knew 
that voice immediately. I turned round. 'Richard!'  

301
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:11,360
I cried. 'Oh Richard, I'm so pleased to 
see you. But what are you doing here?'

302
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:20,160
'I'm coming with you. To Frankfurt. Kelly 
told me to. Look, here's my ticket.'

303
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:26,640
'You mean... Wait a minute. 
What did Kelly tell you?'

304
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:33,280
Richard was smiling. 'He told 
me to come with you, that's all.  

305
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:38,800
To stay with you... you know, on 
the plane... and in Frankfurt.'

306
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:45,680
I began to understand. 'He told 
you to watch me, you mean.'

307
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:51,840
When we were on the plane, Richard 
asked me about my work at Kelly's.  

308
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:59,680
He knew very little about Kelly's business and 
he knew very little about our trip to Frankfurt.  

309
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:09,440
I told him about the 'egg' boxes and why I 
was afraid. 'The boxes are small, Kelly said,  

310
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:17,840
so I think it's jewellery,' I told Richard. 
'And I think... I think it's stolen jewellery.'

311
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,600
Then Richard got very angry, and said,  

312
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:27,360
'Kelly can't send you on a job like 
this. Why doesn't he go himself?'

313
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:34,000
'But that's it, Richard. It's easier 
for a girl - Kelly knows that.  

314
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:41,200
He's clever, you know. But he thinks I'm 
afraid. So he's sent you to watch me.'

315
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:50,080
For a time Richard just sat there, and 
thought. After a while he turned to me.  

316
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:56,240
'You're not going to do it - you're not 
going to carry stolen jewellery for that man.  

317
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:04,320
Leave it to me. I'll think of something, 
of some plan.' Then he was silent again.

318
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:10,640
When we arrived in Frankfurt, we 
went to a hotel for breakfast.  

319
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:18,800
Then Richard went off to buy a newspaper, and 
after that we sat around for about half an hour.

320
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:27,040
We had to meet Kelly's friends outside 
the hotel. When we walked out of the door,  

321
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,960
two men were waiting for us in a white Mercedes.  

322
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:37,120
We drove through the busy streets of 
the city and then into the country.  

323
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:46,160
Sometime later we stopped at an old house 
with trees all around it. We all went inside  

324
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:50,720
and the men took us into a dark 
room at the back and left us there.  

325
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:58,960
It was cold and Richard gave me his 
coat. He was smiling quietly to himself.

326
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:06,320
We waited there in silence. In 
another room people were talking.  

327
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:13,600
We could hear their voices. Then the driver 
of the Mercedes came and took us upstairs.  

328
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:18,960
A short man in a dark green 
shirt was sitting at a desk.  

329
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:28,640
In front of him on the desk were three boxes. He 
was playing with a pen and watching us carefully.  

330
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:34,480
Richard spoke to him in 
German. I did not understand,  

331
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:40,640
but I heard Kelly's name and the man in 
the green shirt began to say something.

332
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:49,760
All at once there were noises outside, the 
sound of cars and voices and people running.  

333
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:59,840
The man jumped up from his desk and pulled a gun 
out of his pocket. He tried to get to the window  

334
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:08,320
but at that minute the door opened and three 
or four policemen ran in and jumped on him.  

335
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:15,520
There was a fight, but the police got his 
gun from him and held him on the floor.  

336
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:25,200
An older man arrived, a police inspector with grey 
hair, and began to give orders to the policemen.  

337
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:31,120
He called across the room to 
Richard and me in very good English,  

338
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:35,440
'Are you all right? They 
didn't hurt you, did they?'

339
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:44,960
He gave some more orders and then he came across 
to Richard and held out his hand. 'Well done,  

340
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:52,080
young man. I must thank you for your 
help.' He turned to me. 'And thank you too.  

341
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:58,480
You've done very well, both of you. It's 
been a good day's work for all of us.'

342
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:03,040
I looked at Richard and he gave me a little smile.  

343
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:09,120
'What does he mean?' I asked, 
but Richard did not answer.

344
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:18,960
The inspector then explained to me. 'Your friend 
phoned us this morning from your hotel. After that  

345
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:26,480
it was easy. We just waited near the hotel for 
the white Mercedes and then followed it here.'

346
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:33,920
The inspector took us back into Frankfurt 
in his car and when we arrived there,  

347
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:42,720
we went at once to his office. He ordered coffee 
for us and while we were waiting for it, he said,  

348
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:51,280
'You've helped us a lot already but we need 
your help with one more thing. There's still  

349
00:42:51,280 --> 00:43:00,640
Mr Kelly... and his friends. We have a plan 
for them.' Oh yes, he knew all about Joe Kelly.

350
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:09,200
He brought out the three boxes and put them 
on the table in front of us. Then he said,  

351
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:13,840
'We would like you to take 
these back to England with you.'

352
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:18,160
Richard and I looked at him in surprise.

353
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:23,040
The inspector waited for 
a minute and then went on,  

354
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:30,400
'You don't need to be afraid. Perhaps you're 
thinking about the British police, is that it?  

355
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:38,160
Everything will be all right. I will speak 
to Chief Superintendent Edwards in London,  

356
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:45,600
and there'll be no trouble for you. 
Now listen carefully.' He went on.  

357
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:54,320
'Just give the jewellery to Kelly. He won't 
know about the "accident to his German friends,  

358
00:43:54,320 --> 00:44:00,240
and you must not tell anybody about 
it, or about our conversation today.  

359
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:09,280
That's very important. The British police 
will watch Kelly and wait. Do you understand?'

360
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:14,880
This plan sounded dangerous 
to me but Richard said,  

361
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:21,840
'Yes, of course well do it, won't we, Wendy?' 
Richard is not afraid of Kelly, you see.

362
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:29,040
So we brought the boxes back with us on 
the Saturday evening plane from Frankfurt.  

363
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:36,640
We did not get back until nearly midnight but 
we took the boxes at once to Kelly's house.  

364
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:42,160
He told us to wait and then 
went into another room.  

365
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:52,320
When he came back, he was very happy. He put 
his hand in his pocket and took out some gold  

366
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:59,520
ear-rings. 'These are for you, Wendy 
- for your birthday next Thursday.'

367
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:07,760
'No, Mr Kelly, no, you mustn't. I 
can't take them, really I can't.'

368
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:17,840
'Of course you can,' Kelly laughed. 'You've worked 
hard for them. And we must have a party for you.  

369
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:25,600
Let's get some people together on Thursday 
night. Where would you like to go? To the Ritz?  

370
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:33,360
Or perhaps a disco? No, I 
know...', and he began to sing:

371
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:37,920
Let's all meet at Maxim's,

372
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:40,640
We'll have a wonderful time.

373
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:49,920
I told him three times that I didn't want a 
party but he didn't want to listen. He was too  

374
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:59,840
pleased with himself. 'Oh, yes, Wendy. We must 
have a party. And you must wear the earrings.  

375
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:09,280
Then I'll know you're my good little girl.' 
His mouth was smiling but his eyes were cold.

376
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:17,200
Richard said quietly in my ear, 'Just 
agree with him, Wendy. And take his  

377
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:22,960
ear-rings - you can give them back later. 
We don't want anything to go wrong now.'

378
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:32,400
The next few days passed very slowly. On Monday 
and Tuesday everything was quiet in the office.  

379
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:37,040
Kelly did not speak to me again 
about the visit to Frankfurt.  

380
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:42,720
He stayed in his office most of the 
time and was always on the telephone.  

381
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:51,360
No police came to the office, and 
nothing happened. I began to feel afraid.

382
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:57,840
Early on Wednesday morning 
Richard called in to see me.  

383
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:03,360
'Is he in yet?' he asked. 
He looked at Kelly's door.

384
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:06,000
'Not yet. Why?'

385
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:10,480
'I want the keys to his 
office. Just for a minute.'

386
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:12,400
'But Richard...'

387
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:15,680
'Come on, Wendy, he'll never know.'

388
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:23,840
'You can't go in there, Richard. He'll be 
here in a minute - it's too dangerous.'

389
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:30,480
'Please, Wendy. It won't take long. 
I'll be out again immediately.'

390
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:34,320
'But why... what do you want?'

391
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:40,080
'Don't ask questions. Just 
give me the keys - quickly.'

392
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:48,800
Of course in the end I gave him the keys. 
He opened Kelly's door and went inside.  

393
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:56,240
Some minutes passed and then he gave 
a shout. I think I've got something!'

394
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:02,880
I went in and saw that Richard was 
standing in front of Kelly's desk  

395
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:11,680
with a letter in his hand. He held it up for 
me. 'This', he said, 'is going to help us.'

396
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:16,640
'What do you mean?' I did not understand.

397
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:21,280
'Listen.' He read from the letter...  

398
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:34,160
the eggs arrived last weekend and they are now 
in my house. Be there on 18th April, 11 a.m.

399
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:38,000
'The 18th,' I said. 'That's next Saturday.'

400
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,800
Just then I heard a car outside.  

401
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:52,560
'That's him,' I cried. 'Quick, put that letter 
back. You must get out of here at once.'

402
00:48:54,480 --> 00:49:01,000
I ran through to my office with Richard 
behind me. 'Out there - quick.' I  

403
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:08,240
pushed him into the kitchen and at the same 
time the door opened and Kelly walked in.

404
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:18,080
'Good morning, Wendy.' He did not stop but went 
into his office and closed the door behind him.

405
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:27,920
Richard then quickly left the office and I 
did not see him again that day. He phoned me  

406
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:35,360
the next afternoon, which was Thursday. I knew 
at once that he was unhappy about something.

407
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:39,600
'What's happened, Richard?' I asked.

408
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:47,200
'I'm not working for Kelly 
anymore,' he told me. This morning  

409
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:54,160
Kelly told me to do another of his little jobs for 
him, and I said no. So he started shouting at me,  

410
00:49:54,960 --> 00:50:03,280
and then he told me to go. So that's it - I'm 
looking for another job.' He gave a little  

411
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:11,840
laugh. 'And worse than that, he hasn't paid me, 
and now I can't buy you a birthday present.'

412
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:18,880
'Oh Richard, that's not important,' I 
said. 'But are you coming to Kelly's  

413
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:25,840
party for me at Maxim's tonight? I 
won't go without you. You must come.'

414
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:35,280
'I can't, Wendy. I'd like to be there, you know 
that. But we mustn't meet until after Saturday.'

415
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:45,040
'Why not? What's happening on Saturday? And 
what's happening about the... the egg boxes?  

416
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:53,840
What are the police doing? Kelly says I must 
wear my new gold ear-rings at the party,  

417
00:50:54,560 --> 00:51:00,720
but I don't want to. They came from 
Frankfurt in one of those egg boxes,  

418
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:09,200
and they're stolen! Oh Richard, 
I'm afraid! What am I going to do?'

419
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:16,880
'Everything's going to be all right, 
Wendy. Really. I've got a plan.  

420
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:22,880
Just go to the party, and don't 
worry. I'll see you soon.'

421
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:31,600
Richard put the phone down, and I have 
not seen or heard from him since then.

422
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:36,240
CHAPTER FOUR

423
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:38,880
Another birthday present

424
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:49,840
Jennifer felt very sorry for Wendy. The girl's 
hands were shaking, and she was trying not to cry.  

425
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:56,080
Jennifer went and sat next to 
her, and put her arm round her.

426
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:02,240
'So what happened after the 
party on Thursday night,  

427
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:07,120
when the police took you away?' she asked quietly.

428
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:15,920
'Oh, it was terrible!' Wendy said. 'They 
took the earrings from me, of course,  

429
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:24,720
and they asked a lot of questions. I told them 
that the ear-rings were a present from Kelly,  

430
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:34,400
and I told them all about the police in Germany, 
but they didn't believe me. They told me to go  

431
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:42,080
to the office on Friday, and not to say anything 
to anybody. And they wanted to talk to Richard.

432
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:53,600
Wendy turned to Jennifer. 'What am I going to 
do? she asked. 'Why didn't the police believe me?  

433
00:52:55,120 --> 00:53:02,240
Haven't the German police talked to them? 
And where's Richard? I can't find him.'  

434
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:06,480
She began to cry quietly.

435
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:17,280
Jennifer stood up. 'We must phone the police in 
Germany,' she said. 'I'll talk to that policeman,  

436
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:20,080
Barrett, who came to see me last night, and...'

437
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:28,880
Just then there was a knock on the door. Jennifer 
went to the door and called out, 'Who is it?

438
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:35,680
'It's me! Richard!' came Richard's excited voice.

439
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:39,280
Jennifer opened the door quickly.  

440
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:47,360
Beside Richard there were two policemen 
- Barrett and another, taller man.

441
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:52,960
'Everything's OK,' Richard said happily.  

442
00:53:54,320 --> 00:54:00,400
He turned to the two policemen and smiled. 
'And you're not going to lock me up, are you?'

443
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:05,440
'I'm very pleased to hear that!' said Jennifer.  

444
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:09,840
'But what's going on? Can 
somebody please explain?'

445
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:18,880
They all went into the sitting-room, and 
Wendy jumped up. She looked at the policemen  

446
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:28,720
and her face went white. Everybody began talking 
at once, and Richard put his arms round Wendy.

447
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:33,520
The tall policeman laughed and turned to Jennifer.  

448
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:42,080
'My name is Edwards,' he said. 'I'm sorry 
about Barrett's visit to you last night,  

449
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:50,400
but we didn't know about Richard and Wendy then. 
I talked to the Frankfurt police an hour ago.  

450
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:58,480
We already knew about the stolen jewellery in 
Germany, of course, and we were watching Kelly.  

451
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:05,520
But they didn't tell us that they caught 
the German thieves last weekend, or about  

452
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:14,000
their little plan with Richard and Wendy. They 
wanted to keep it very secret. They were afraid  

453
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:20,320
that Kelly would hear about it. But we 
know now, and everything's all right.'

454
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:27,760
'But what about Kelly?' cried 
Wendy. 'And the egg boxes...?'

455
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:38,080
Barrett smiled. 'You'll have to find a new boss. 
Kelly is going to be in prison for a long time.  

456
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:43,600
We got him this morning. But it's Richard's story.  

457
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:51,440
He's been very helpful to us. 
He can tell you all about it.'

458
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:57,840
The two policemen left, and Jennifer 
turned to her young brother. He was  

459
00:55:57,840 --> 00:56:03,440
sitting with his arm round Wendy, and 
her face was now bright and happy.

460
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:09,040
'Well!' Jennifer said. 'Start talking, Richard!'

461
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:13,840
'I've told Jennifer all about last week,'  

462
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:22,160
Wendy explained. 'And she was in Maxim's on 
Thursday night. But what happened this morning?'

463
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:31,920
Richard laughed. 'When I looked in Kelly's 
office last Wednesday, I found that letter  

464
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:40,080
about the "eggs". You remember, Wendy? Well, 
the German policeman told us to do nothing,  

465
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:49,440
but I wanted the British police to catch Kelly. 
Perhaps they were watching Kelly carefully, but I  

466
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:57,840
wanted to be sure. So early this morning I went to 
the police station and told them about the letter.  

467
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:03,520
They were not very friendly and 
they kept me in the police station.  

468
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:07,840
But they went to Kelly's house at eleven o'clock.  

469
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:17,440
They found Kelly there and two other men, who 
were buying the stolen jewellery from Kelly. So  

470
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:24,000
they brought Kelly and the two other men into the 
police station... and the egg boxes, of course.  

471
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:34,240
Kelly was very angry, and told the police that 
Wendy and I were the thieves! I told Barrett and  

472
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:42,480
Edwards about the German policeman's plan again 
and again, and in the end they telephoned Germany  

473
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:49,520
and talked to the inspector in Frankfurt. 
He explained everything. So here we are!'

474
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:55,920
Richard laughed again, happily. 
He put his hands in his pockets.  

475
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:04,640
'And here's twenty pounds for my big sister, and 
a little birthday present for my favourite girl.'

476
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:14,880
Jennifer looked at him. She suddenly felt very 
happy about her brother. 'You can keep the money,'  

477
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:23,840
she said. 'It's not important. But I only gave 
it to you on Thursday night,' she said. 'How...?'

478
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:28,160
'I've got a new job,' said Richard.  

479
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:36,320
'Started yesterday. And this time I'm 
not working for a jewellery thief!'

480
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:40,880
Wendy opened her present, and 
laughed for the first time that day.  

481
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:49,840
'Oh look!' she said. 'It's some 
gold earrings! They're lovely.'

482
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:55,680
Richard laughed too. 'They're 
only small ear-rings, Wendy,  

483
00:58:56,320 --> 00:59:03,520
but I can tell you this - they did not 
come from Frankfurt in an egg box!'
 
 
 
 

484
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:04,101
- THE END -
