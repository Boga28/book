00:00:00,989 --> 00:00:05,910
CHAPTER ONE
The accident

2
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:08,210
It was dark.

3
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:10,940
Nobody saw the accident.

4
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:15,789
The small white car was found on its side
by the bridge.

5
00:00:15,789 --> 00:00:23,109
A river ran underneath the road there, and
the car was lying next to the bridge wall,

6
00:00:23,109 --> 00:00:26,480
below the road.

7
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,119
Inside the car was a dead woman.

8
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:36,430
Her name was Karen Silkwood and she was twenty-eight
years old.

9
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:40,230
It was November 13th, 1974.

10
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:46,160
How did the car come off the road?

11
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,160
Why was it on the wrong side of the road?

12
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,370
Why was it so far from the road?

13
00:00:54,370 --> 00:01:01,010
There was nothing wrong with the car, Karen
Silkwood was a good driver.

14
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:05,339
Everybody knew that.

15
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:11,210
The police thought that there was an easy
answer to these questions.

16
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:17,369
Karen was tired after a long day, so she fell
asleep while she was driving.

17
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:22,170
It could happen to anyone very easily.

18
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:29,060
They took the car to a garage and they took
Karen's body to a hospital.

19
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:39,110
But some people were not happy about the accident,
first or all, her boyfriend, Drew Stephens.

20
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:46,479
Also a newspaper journalist from the New York
Times and a Union official from Washington.

21
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:54,009
'These three men were waiting for Karen on
the night of the accident.

22
00:01:54,009 --> 00:02:01,770
She was bringing them some papers and some
photographs in a big brown envelope.

23
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:05,759
The papers were very important.

24
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:11,550
The men were waiting for Karen in a hotel
room a few miles from the accident.

25
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:16,040
But she never arrived.

26
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:22,570
When they heard about the accident, the men
looked for the brown envelope at once.

27
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:26,110
They looked for it inside the white car.

28
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:31,270
They looked for it at the hospital and at
the police station.

29
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:37,560
The next morning they looked all around the
wall and in the river, but they never found

30
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,500
it.

31
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:47,550
Nobody ever found that brown envelope.

32
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:50,870
CHAPTER TWO
The new job

33
00:02:50,870 --> 00:03:01,340
The story of Karen and her brown envelope
began in 1972 when she rook a new job at a

34
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:05,630
nuclear factory in Oklahoma.

35
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:13,640
Before that, she worked as a secretary, but
in 1972 she was really tired of a secretary's

36
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,860
life.

37
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:22,460
She looked in the newspaper and saw that there
was a job at the nuclear factory.

38
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:29,950
The pay was much better than a secretary's
pay, and the work was more interesting.

39
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:36,900
She went to see Mr Bailey, the manager of
the factory, and she was surprised and happy

40
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,790
when he gave her the job immediately.

41
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:46,070
He asked Karen to start work the next day.

42
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:52,700
On her first day at the factory Karen learnt
a lot, Mr Bailey told her that she had to

43
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:59,570
wear a special white coat, some special shoes
and a white hat.

44
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:06,260
'These clothes protect you from radioactive
dust,' he said.

45
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:10,900
'There isn't really any danger, of course.

46
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,540
Everything is safe here.

47
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:16,709
We cheek everything all the time.'

48
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:21,280
'I see,' said Karen.

49
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:27,130
'You need an identity card to get into the
factory every morning.

50
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:31,840
Just give me a photograph of you and I'll
give you a card.

51
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,150
A pretty picture of a pretty girl.'

52
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:38,789
He smiled.

53
00:04:38,789 --> 00:04:41,689
Karen didn't like that smile.

54
00:04:41,689 --> 00:04:45,789
'He thinks I'm stupid' she thought.

55
00:04:45,789 --> 00:04:51,440
'Why do men always think that pretty girls
are stupid?'

56
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,270
He was still speaking.

57
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:58,630
'Now I'll call Mrs Phillips.

58
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:03,910
She'll take you round the factory and show
you your laboratory.

59
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:08,229
The manager there will explain the job to
you.

60
00:05:08,229 --> 00:05:11,320
Don't worry - it's very easy.'

61
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:15,919
He smiled his thin smile again.

62
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:20,970
The door opened and Mrs Phillips came in.

63
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:25,270
She was about forty years old and a little
fat.

64
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:26,889
She looked afraid.

65
00:05:26,889 --> 00:05:31,199
'You wanted me, Mr Bailey?'

66
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,669
"Yes, Susan.

67
00:05:33,669 --> 00:05:36,749
This is Karen Silkwood.

68
00:05:36,749 --> 00:05:41,020
She's going to work with you in your laboratory.

69
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:45,840
Could you take her round the factory and tell
her about the work?'

70
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,530
'Oh, I see.

71
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:52,210
Of course, Mr Bailey.

72
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:57,719
Please follow me, Miss Silkwood.'

73
00:05:57,719 --> 00:06:06,559
When the office door closed, Mrs Phillips
smiled at Karen, and said, 'That was lucky!

74
00:06:06,559 --> 00:06:12,590
Usually if he calls me, he wants to shout
at me about something.

75
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:14,720
Please call me Susan.

76
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,850
Can I call you Karen?'

77
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:21,569
'Of course,' said Karen.

78
00:06:21,569 --> 00:06:29,319
They walked down a long corridor with heavy
doors on both sides, Susan opened one of the

79
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:30,629
doors.

80
00:06:30,629 --> 00:06:35,879
'This is our laboratory.'

81
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:39,559
Karen saw six or seven people in the room.

82
00:06:39,559 --> 00:06:47,340
They were all wearing white gloves and their
hands were inside a big glass box.

83
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:54,470
There were holes in the side of the box - just
big enough for hands.

84
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:56,330
Everyone looked at Karen.

85
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:59,259
'What's in the box?'

86
00:06:59,259 --> 00:07:02,039
Karen asked Susan.

87
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:03,740
Everyone laughed.

88
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:08,090
'Not chocolate,' said one worker.

89
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:16,160
'Or beer,' said another, 'Don't listen to
them,' said Susan.

90
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,979
'It's fuel rods and uranium.

91
00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:24,330
We put uranium into the fuel rods.

92
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:28,210
That's why you must always wear your gloves.

93
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:34,840
And when you leave the laboratory, always
remember to take off your gloves and check

94
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:39,279
your hands in front of the scanner.'

95
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:43,710
She showed Karen the scanner, which was near
the door.

96
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:51,900
'If there's any radioactive dust on your hands,
the scanner knows at once.

97
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:56,009
An alarm rings all over the factory.'

98
00:07:56,009 --> 00:08:04,099
'And when the alarm rings, the party begins,'
said one man.

99
00:08:04,099 --> 00:08:05,979
'Party?'

100
00:08:05,979 --> 00:08:06,979
Karen asked.

101
00:08:06,979 --> 00:08:16,740
'You can take off all your clothes and have
a swim... with lots of water.'

102
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:21,360
'He means they wash you in a shower,' said
Susan.

103
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,349
'It doesn't happen very often.'

104
00:08:26,349 --> 00:08:30,089
Karen went home happy at the end of the day.

105
00:08:30,089 --> 00:08:32,719
She didn't think that the work was difficult.

106
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:41,820
And the money was good... very good.

107
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:48,709
CHAPTER THREE
Karen and Drew

108
00:08:48,709 --> 00:08:52,720
At first Karen liked her new job.

109
00:08:52,720 --> 00:09:00,899
She was an ordinary, small-town girl who liked
ordinary things: a comfortable home, a glass

110
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:05,500
of beer, an evening with good friends.

111
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:09,980
Soon she had some new friends from the factory.

112
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:12,860
She also liked Drew.

113
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:20,220
He worked in another part of the factory,
but everyone used the same coffee bar.

114
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:24,940
She met him a few days after she started the
job.

115
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:31,560
In the coffee bar she and Susan were laughing
together at a story in the newspaper.

116
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:36,570
Then Karen suddenly heard a voice behind her.

117
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:39,880
'Here's a new face'

118
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,500
She turned round quickly.

119
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:49,120
A tall man was standing just behind her chair
with a coffee in his hand.

120
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:53,970
'Be careful with that coffee, will you?' said
Karen.

121
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:58,130
'You're going to drop some on me in a moment.

122
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:01,800
'It's too good to be true.

123
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:07,050
Nobody as beautiful as you ever works in this
factory.

124
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:12,790
What about having a pizza with me tonight
after work?'

125
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:15,790
Karen wasn't sure what to say.

126
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:21,730
He looked nice, but she didn't know anything
about him.

127
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:24,380
Susan understood what Karen was thinking.

128
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:27,250
'Don't worry, dear.

129
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,290
It's only Drew.

130
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:35,589
He's big and he doesn't talk much, but he's
not dangerous.'

131
00:10:35,589 --> 00:10:37,200
Drew laughed.

132
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,000
'Thanks, Susan.

133
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,980
I'll buy you a coffee every day this week
for that."

134
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:47,200
He turned to Karen.

135
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,920
'Can I buy you a pizza or not?

136
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,670
What do you say?'

137
00:10:53,670 --> 00:11:00,000
Karen smiled, 'I never miss a free meal.'

138
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,259
When Karen arrived at the restaurant that
evening.

139
00:11:03,259 --> 00:11:06,040
Drew was already there.

140
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:12,360
He stood up when she came in and gave her
a big friendly smile.

141
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,579
Karen thought of Mr Bailey's smile.

142
00:11:15,579 --> 00:11:20,800
How could two smiles be so different?

143
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:27,230
Karen found that it was very easy to talk
to Drew, He listened to what she said and

144
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:30,279
they laughed at the same things.

145
00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:34,649
It was like talking to her favourite brother.

146
00:11:34,649 --> 00:11:40,170
In the next few weeks they spent a lot of
time together.

147
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:44,139
Everyone at the factory saw how happy they
were.

148
00:11:44,139 --> 00:11:53,879
Life was going well for Karen.

149
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:56,769
CHAPTER FOUR
The shower

150
00:11:56,769 --> 00:12:07,040
But in the summer of 1974 everything began
to change.

151
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:12,630
One evening Karen and Susan were leaving the
laboratory.

152
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:18,949
First Karen cheeked her hands in front of
the scanner, and then a minute later Susan

153
00:12:18,949 --> 00:12:22,130
checked her hands.

154
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:25,760
Suddenly there was a terrible noise.

155
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,980
It was like a high scream.

156
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:33,740
Everybody could hear it all over the factory.

157
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:35,690
Susan didn't move.

158
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:39,029
She just looked at her hands.

159
00:12:39,029 --> 00:12:42,550
Then the door of the laboratory flew open.

160
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:49,660
Two men in white coats ran in and took Susan
by the arms.

161
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:55,339
Before Karen could do anything, they pulled
Susan through the door.

162
00:12:55,339 --> 00:12:59,920
The terrible noise of the alarm was still
going.

163
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,920
Karen shouted:

164
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:05,060
'Where are you taking her?'

165
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:07,410
Nobody could hear.

166
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:10,050
Nobody answered.

167
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:13,440
Suddenly the noise stopped.

168
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,560
Karen turned to the other workers.

169
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,540
'Where will she be?'

170
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:23,519
'In the shower room.'

171
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:30,590
Karen ran out of the laboratory and along
the corridor to the shower room.

172
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:34,460
Inside the room Susan was screaming.

173
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:38,120
Karen pushed open the door.

174
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:45,899
Susan had no clothes on, and the two men were
showering her from head to foot - in her eyes,

175
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:49,910
inside her cars, everywhere.

176
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:53,250
The water hit her body like stones.

177
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,889
'Stop that!'

178
00:13:55,889 --> 00:13:57,399
shouted Karen.

179
00:13:57,399 --> 00:14:00,319
'You're hurting her.'

180
00:14:00,319 --> 00:14:05,170
'Not as much as radioactive dust can hurt
her.

181
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:12,230
One very small piece could kill her,' shouted
back one of the men.

182
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:15,889
Ten minutes later they stopped the shower.

183
00:14:15,889 --> 00:14:20,920
Susan's face was as white as snow and she
was shaking with cold.

184
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:26,449
The men checked her body again with a hand
scanner.

185
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:28,069
'OK.

186
00:14:28,069 --> 00:14:30,139
You're clean now.

187
00:14:30,139 --> 00:14:32,330
Put your clothes on.

188
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:39,300
In five minutes we'll come back and take you
to the medical center for more tests.'

189
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:43,399
They left, Susan looked at Karen.

190
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:47,660
'They say I'm clean.

191
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:48,839
Outside perhaps.

192
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:52,240
But what about inside?

193
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,160
How much radioactive dust is in my body?

194
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,699
Am I "hot"?'

195
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:03,480
Her voice was quiet and tired.

196
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,889
Suddenly she looked old.

197
00:15:05,889 --> 00:15:11,629
Slowly, she began to put her clothes on.

198
00:15:11,629 --> 00:15:14,120
'"Hot"?

199
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:17,740
What do you mean?' asked Karen.

200
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:21,370
'"Hot" means radioactive.'

201
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:25,290
'I see.'

202
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:27,899
Karen looked at her own hands.

203
00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:29,970
Were they clean?

204
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:33,740
How carefully did the scanner check them?

205
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:37,759
She worked next to Susan in the laboratory.

206
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:41,529
Perhaps the dust was on her hands, too.

207
00:15:41,529 --> 00:15:45,130
'I'm sure you're fine, Susan.

208
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:47,740
The men said you were OK.

209
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:50,180
And the doctors will know.'

210
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:53,100
'Nobody knows.

211
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,670
Uranium is very new.

212
00:15:55,670 --> 00:16:00,480
Nobody really knows what it can do to us.'

213
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,899
One of the men came back with a woman.

214
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:06,529
'Come along, dear.

215
00:16:06,529 --> 00:16:09,939
Time for your medical tests.'

216
00:16:09,939 --> 00:16:12,880
Then they saw Karen near the door.

217
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,170
'What are you doing here?

218
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:21,370
If you've finished work for today, you can
go home.'

219
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:23,399
Karen did not listen to them.

220
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:26,649
'Are you OK, Susan?

221
00:16:26,649 --> 00:16:30,220
Do you want me to come with you?'

222
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,790
Susan shook her head.

223
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:34,970
'No, it's OK.

224
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:39,550
You go home, Karen, I'll phone you later.

225
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:42,000
Don't worry about me.

226
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,980
And thank you.'

227
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:52,589
The man and the woman took Susan's arms and
walked down the corridor, with Susan between

228
00:16:52,589 --> 00:16:54,060
them.

229
00:16:54,060 --> 00:17:03,480
She looked very small and very afraid.

230
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:07,199
CHAPTER FIVE
The new union official

231
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:14,029
After the shower Susan was a different person.

232
00:17:14,029 --> 00:17:19,240
She was quiet and didn't laugh very often.

233
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:26,159
One evening, a few months after the shower,
Karen met Susan in a bar for a drink after

234
00:17:26,159 --> 00:17:27,159
work.

235
00:17:27,159 --> 00:17:33,050
'You know, Karen, we realty must leave the
factory.

236
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:34,659
It's very dangerous.

237
00:17:34,659 --> 00:17:39,830
How many times do we hear the alarm now?

238
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:41,780
More and more often.

239
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:47,779
And every time we hear it, we know that someone
is in danger.'

240
00:17:47,779 --> 00:17:51,190
'How does it happen?

241
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:56,700
I don't understand it,' said Karen.

242
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:02,030
'It's because the factory is working twenty-four
hours a day.

243
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:07,050
The safety people can't do their job well.

244
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:13,660
They have to check everything carefully every
day, but when can they do it?

245
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:18,840
When we finish, there are the people who come
in to work at night.

246
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:25,020
The managers don't care about the danger,
They only care about the money.

247
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:29,990
And you know, Karen, I'm just the same.

248
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:39,380
I also have to think only of money, I have
three children and my husband is dead, I need

249
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:42,210
the money from the factory.

250
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:47,210
It's more than I can get from any other job
in Oklahoma.

251
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:51,590
Three children are expensive, very expensive...'

252
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:55,919
'Of course,' answered Karen.

253
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:58,440
'I understand.

254
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,490
Drew and I have talked about this.

255
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:05,059
He's thinking about leaving, too.'

256
00:19:05,059 --> 00:19:09,760
'It's OK for a young man, strong like Drew.

257
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:15,299
He can get many other jobs, You could leave
too, Karen.

258
00:19:15,299 --> 00:19:18,090
Why don't you?'

259
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:21,340
'Because I've decided to change things here.

260
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:26,460
I like the job and I like the people who work
here.

261
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:28,410
The money is good.

262
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:33,090
We just need to improve safety - that's all.

263
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:36,240
Surely that's not difficult?

264
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,929
We have to talk to the managers and tell them
it's important.

265
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:45,090
Do you know Bob in Laboratory 16?

266
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:52,660
Well, don't laugh, but he's asked me to be
on the Union Committee, and I'm going to try

267
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:53,789
it.'

268
00:19:53,789 --> 00:19:57,600
'But, Karen, you can't.

269
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,789
You're a woman, There are no women on the
Committee.

270
00:20:01,789 --> 00:20:07,059
The men won't vote for you,' said Susan.

271
00:20:07,059 --> 00:20:10,830
'Perhaps not,' replied Karen.

272
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:13,809
'But what about you?

273
00:20:13,809 --> 00:20:16,340
Will you vote for me?

274
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:20,970
Do you know how many women work for this factory?

275
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:22,580
Hundreds.

276
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:26,280
And why won't the men vote for me?

277
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:32,200
Perhaps I'm the first woman who has asked
for their vote.'

278
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,580
Susan smiled.

279
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:36,380
'Well...'

280
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:41,380
But she couldn't find a good answer to Karen's
question.

281
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:47,850
A week later, when the workers had to vote
for the new Committee, most of the women voted

282
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:49,450
for Karen.

283
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:53,470
And a lot of the men voted for her, too.

284
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:59,220
They saw that she really wanted to change
things at the factory, and everyone agreed

285
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:03,900
with her that safety was very important.

286
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:14,049
So Karen was now an official on the factory's
Union Committee.

287
00:21:14,049 --> 00:21:17,470
CHAPTER SIX
The meeting in Washington

288
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:24,559
A month or two later the alarm sounded again.

289
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:28,660
This time Karen was in front of the scanner.

290
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:32,460
She went quietly with the men in white coats.

291
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:39,419
But after her shower she asked them a lot
of questions about safety in the factory.

292
00:21:39,419 --> 00:21:42,380
They didn't answer any questions.

293
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:44,380
They just got angry.

294
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:50,890
They knew she was on the Union Committee and
they were afraid of her.

295
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:56,070
All the managers knew that Karen was on the
Committee because she always had a notebook

296
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:58,600
in her hand.

297
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:05,980
In her notebook she wrote down all the scanner
alarms, every shower and every other danger

298
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:08,529
in the factory.

299
00:22:08,529 --> 00:22:15,669
She asked a lot of people a lot of questions
and always wrote the answers in her notebook.

300
00:22:15,669 --> 00:22:20,480
The notebook was getting full.

301
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:26,970
In September 1974 the Union Committee had
a meeting.

302
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:32,490
Everybody could see that safety at the factory
was getting worse.

303
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:38,559
The Committee decided to write to the Union
leaders in Washington and ask for help.

304
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:44,700
Two days later there was a phone call from
Washington.

305
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:51,059
The leaders wanted to see the Union Committee
immediately in Washington.

306
00:22:51,059 --> 00:22:57,770
For Karen this journey to Washington was a
big adventure.

307
00:22:57,770 --> 00:23:03,100
She wanted to see The White House and all
the other famous places in the first city

308
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:08,409
of the USA, but she had very little free time.

309
00:23:08,409 --> 00:23:13,730
She spent nearly all the time at a long meeting.

310
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:20,860
At first the leaders just listened to what
Karen and the others said about the factory.

311
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:25,179
Their faces got more and more unhappy.

312
00:23:25,179 --> 00:23:28,270
Karen explained what was happening.

313
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:35,270
'The managers take photographs of the fuel
rods to check that they are safe.

314
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:40,980
But I know that they are secretly changing
the negatives of the photographs.

315
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:43,679
And why are they doing that?

316
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:49,570
Because the photographs show that the rods
are not safe.'

317
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:56,540
Suddenly one of the leaders said to Karen,
'Do you understand what you're saying, Miss

318
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:58,690
Silkwood?

319
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:04,440
The lives of many people could be in danger
if you're right.

320
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:09,210
Uranium is very, very dangerous.'

321
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:15,390
'I'm just telling you what the people in the
photographic laboratory have told me,' Karen

322
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:16,640
said.

323
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:23,029
'If this is true, the government will close
your factory.

324
00:24:23,029 --> 00:24:25,650
Do you understand what that means?

325
00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:29,860
A lot of people will lose their jobs.

326
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:36,700
The story will be on the front page of every
newspaper.'

327
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,460
Karen looked unhappy.

328
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:41,110
'Will it?

329
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:47,820
We only want the managers to change a few
things and to be more careful about safety.'

330
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:53,850
I think it's already too late for that.'

331
00:24:53,850 --> 00:25:00,350
After the meeting one of the leaders stopped
Karen outside in the corridor.

332
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:05,300
'Just come with me for a minute, please,'
he said.

333
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:09,940
He took Karen into a small room and closed
the door.

334
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:13,630
He didn't want anybody to hear them.

335
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:19,110
'Karen, we need proof about these negatives.

336
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:23,710
Without proof nobody will believe our story.

337
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:26,630
Can you get some for us?'

338
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:29,280
'What proof do you need?'

339
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:37,110
'Someone will have to go into the photographic
laboratory and steal some negatives.

340
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:43,590
We need the negatives both before they change
them and after they change them.

341
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:47,030
Do you know where they keep the negatives?'

342
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:53,290
'Yes, I know,' said Karen quietly.

343
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:56,390
'But it will be very difficult.

344
00:25:56,390 --> 00:26:00,539
I don't work in the photographic laboratory.

345
00:26:00,539 --> 00:26:06,539
If one of the managers sees me there, how
can I explain what I'm doing?'

346
00:26:06,539 --> 00:26:12,490
'I don't know, but you'll have to think of
something.

347
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:17,409
We can't help you if you haven't any proof.'

348
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:20,990
They were both silent for a minute.

349
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:23,250
Karen looked out of the window.

350
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:25,960
It was a lovely evening.

351
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:32,120
She thought of Mr Bailey's cold smile and
Susan's screams in the shower.

352
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:35,570
'I'll do it,' she said.

353
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:37,510
'Good girl.

354
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:41,269
It will be very dangerous.

355
00:26:41,269 --> 00:26:43,710
Nobody must know what you're doing.

356
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:47,760
Not your friends on the Committee - nobody.

357
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:51,039
I'll be the only person who knows.

358
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:56,720
I'll phone you once a week and you can tell
me how you're getting on.'

359
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,700
'Nobody?

360
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:03,420
Can't I tell my boyfriend Drew?' asked Karen.

361
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:04,470
'No.

362
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:07,350
It could be dangerous for anybody who knows.'

363
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:11,200
'I see.

364
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,130
OK.

365
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:17,550
I'll do what I can,' said Karen slowly.

366
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:21,210
'Be very, very careful.

367
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:24,260
You're a brave girl.

368
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:30,039
I'd like to thank you for agreeing to do this.'

369
00:27:30,039 --> 00:27:32,450
Karen stood up.

370
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:40,510
Outside the window the sun was still shining,
but she felt cold and lonely.

371
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:44,010
'Can I phone you if I need to speak to someone?'

372
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:46,110
'Of course.

373
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:49,120
Any time, day or night.

374
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:54,169
This is my card with my name and phone number.'

375
00:27:54,169 --> 00:27:56,510
Karen took his card.

376
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:59,940
She saw that his name was Pete.

377
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:08,970
She looked at him once more and then she left
the room.

378
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:15,990
CHAPTER SEVEN
The brown envelope

379
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:22,020
When she arrived back from Washington, Drew
was waiting at the airport.

380
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:23,750
'Did you have a good time?'

381
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:25,600
'Not really.

382
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:29,680
Things are worse at the factory than we thought.

383
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:35,330
The Union leaders are going to send some doctors
to the factory to talk to everyone about the

384
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:37,870
dangers of uranium.'

385
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:42,760
'Poor Karen, You look very tired.

386
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:47,860
Let's go home, have a beer and listen to some
music.

387
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:52,960
Forget the factory for one evening.'

388
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:57,159
Karen looked at Drew's kind, strong face.

389
00:28:57,159 --> 00:29:04,919
She wanted so much to tell him... but no,
she mustn't tell anybody.

390
00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:07,799
She tried to smile.

391
00:29:07,799 --> 00:29:09,549
'OK.

392
00:29:09,549 --> 00:29:13,210
What about a pizza at our favourite restaurant?'

393
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:15,070
she said.

394
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:24,970
During the month of October 1974 Karen told
nobody about her secret, but she felt very

395
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:26,980
lonely.

396
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:32,909
She began to work at nights because there
were fewer people working in the factory then,

397
00:29:32,909 --> 00:29:38,580
and so it was easier to get into the photographic
laboratory.

398
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:45,539
Very slowly and carefully, she began stealing
negatives.

399
00:29:45,539 --> 00:29:51,760
She put the negatives in a brown envelope
and put the envelope in a secret hole in the

400
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:55,330
wall of her house.

401
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:58,110
Nobody knew it was there.

402
00:29:58,110 --> 00:30:03,970
In the daytime, when she was not at work,
it was difficult to sleep.

403
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:07,010
She was afraid all the time.

404
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:11,500
She often felt that people were watching her.

405
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:18,620
Soon some doctors came from Washington and
spoke to the workers.

406
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:22,890
After that everyone tried to help Karen.

407
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:28,140
They were really afraid when they heard about
the dangers of uranium.

408
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:33,169
Soon Karen had to begin a new notebook.

409
00:30:33,169 --> 00:30:38,320
Everywhere she went in the factory, the notebook
went with her.

410
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:43,720
The managers watched Karen and they watched
her notebook.

411
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:48,880
One day she left it on a table in the coffee
bar for two minutes while she went to get

412
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,340
some sugar.

413
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:55,900
A manager tried to take it, but the other
workers stopped him.

414
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:58,080
'What are you doing?

415
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:01,389
That's Karen's book.'

416
00:31:01,389 --> 00:31:06,550
The manager's face turned red and he put the
book down.

417
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:11,159
But the managers were now watching her all
the time.

418
00:31:11,159 --> 00:31:16,730
It was more and more difficult to get into
the photographic laboratory.

419
00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:23,279
But in the last week of October, Karen told
the Union leader in Washington that she had

420
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:26,409
nearly all the proof necessary.

421
00:31:26,409 --> 00:31:31,880
'That's wonderful,' said Pete's soft voice
in Washington.

422
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:34,710
'When you're ready.

423
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:40,390
I'll take you to meet an important man from
the New York Times.

424
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:46,600
We'll give the story to the newspapers, and
they'll tell the world about it.

425
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:52,230
Then the government and the factory managers
will have to do something about the dangers

426
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:54,730
of your work.'

427
00:31:54,730 --> 00:31:59,250
'Give me just a little more time,' said Karen.

428
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:05,799
And she put down the telephone.

429
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:06,799
CHAPTER EIGHT

430
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:11,870
A 'hot' home

431
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:18,809
At the beginning of November Karen was ready
for the meeting with the New York Times journalist.

432
00:32:18,809 --> 00:32:22,559
The brown envelope was full.

433
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:26,700
Then Drew decided to leave his job at the
factory.

434
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:30,519
He told Karen that the work was too dangerous.

435
00:32:30,519 --> 00:32:33,250
He wanted Karen to leave, too.

436
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:37,429
'Not yet,' Karen said.

437
00:32:37,429 --> 00:32:42,590
She wanted to stay until the meeting with
the New York Times.

438
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:46,759
She knew she would have to leave the factory
after that.

439
00:32:46,759 --> 00:32:51,539
But how could she explain to Drew?

440
00:32:51,539 --> 00:32:58,470
Karen was now working during the daytime again,
and on the evening of November 6th she passed

441
00:32:58,470 --> 00:33:03,220
the scanner on her way out of the laboratory.

442
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:06,400
Suddenly the alarm sounded.

443
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,889
She had to have another shower.

444
00:33:08,889 --> 00:33:16,980
After the shower she went home, very tired
and unhappy.

445
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:23,090
After she arrived home, she went to the bathroom
for a quick wash and then she went to the

446
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:28,809
kitchen to make a sandwich for the next morning
at the factory.

447
00:33:28,809 --> 00:33:32,130
Then she went to bed.

448
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:38,540
The next morning, November 7th, she got up
and went to work.

449
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:44,820
She was still tired, and she forgot to take
her sandwich out of the fridge.

450
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:48,980
On the way into her laboratory she passed
the scanner.

451
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:53,580
Immediately the alarm sounded.

452
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:56,529
Everyone stopped what they were doing.

453
00:33:56,529 --> 00:34:03,960
The alarm never went off when people arrived
- only when they left...

454
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:07,350
Everyone looked at Karen.

455
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:11,760
'Perhaps the scanner's wrong,' said Susan.

456
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:17,139
But the men in white arrived and began to
pull Karen out of the room.

457
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:21,260
'No, please... not again.

458
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:24,669
All my body hurts from the shower last night...'

459
00:34:24,669 --> 00:34:28,100
But nobody listened.

460
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:30,889
They showered her again.

461
00:34:30,889 --> 00:34:36,579
But after the shower she didn't pass the usual
scanner test.

462
00:34:36,579 --> 00:34:40,740
There was still something radioactive in her
body.

463
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:46,210
'What does it mean?' asked Karen.

464
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:47,679
Nobody answered.

465
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:51,450
A doctor arrived and checked the test again.

466
00:34:51,450 --> 00:34:53,550
He shook his head.

467
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:59,170
'Where were you last night?' he asked.

468
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:01,220
'Here,' said Karen.

469
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:02,960
'I was working late.'

470
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:07,050
'Where did you go after work?'

471
00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:09,800
'Home, of course.

472
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:12,920
I was tired so I went to bed.'

473
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:15,700
'Are you sure?'

474
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:17,099
'Sure?

475
00:35:17,099 --> 00:35:19,790
Of course I'm sure.'

476
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:21,960
'Did you see anyone?'

477
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:26,220
'Only the other girl in my house, Paula.

478
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:29,599
I just said good night to her.

479
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:32,320
She was already in bed.'

480
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,130
'OK...

481
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:37,339
Let's go,' said one of the men in white.

482
00:35:37,339 --> 00:35:38,359
'Where?'

483
00:35:38,359 --> 00:35:41,420
'What's your address?'

484
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:45,450
'26 Third Avenue West...

485
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:46,670
Why?'

486
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:49,630
'Get in the car.

487
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:52,339
Don't ask stupid questions.

488
00:35:52,339 --> 00:35:54,980
We don't answer questions from thieves.'

489
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:55,980
'Thieves?

490
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:59,710
What have I stolen?'

491
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:04,390
'Get into the car.'

492
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:08,220
Someone pushed Karen into a big white car.

493
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:11,300
It was full of more men in white.

494
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:18,060
They were all wearing the special white clothes
and hats to protect their faces and bodies,

495
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:21,630
and they were all holding scanners.

496
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:26,780
They drove to Karen's home and opened the
door with Karen's key.

497
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:32,750
'Stay in the car,' one of the men in white
shouted at Karen.

498
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:36,100
But Karen didn't listen to him.

499
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:40,910
She followed them to the house and looked
through the windows.

500
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:48,080
The men went all round the house with the
scanners and everywhere was radioactive - the

501
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:52,970
kitchen, the bedroom, the bathroom.

502
00:36:52,970 --> 00:37:00,180
The kitchen was very 'hot', and when the men
opened the fridge, the noise from the scanners

503
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:02,490
was very loud.

504
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:05,630
The men followed the noise to the sandwich.

505
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:11,970
'I suppose she made this last night,' said
one of the men.

506
00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:14,220
'Stupid girl.

507
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:18,960
She's lucky that nobody has eaten it.'

508
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:23,040
They put the sandwich carefully into a bag.

509
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:26,010
That was only the beginning.

510
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:34,450
Soon all Karen's things were in bags - her
clothes, her books, her photos.

511
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:39,579
When they took her photo of Drew, Karen couldn't
stay quiet any longer.

512
00:37:39,579 --> 00:37:42,359
'What are yon doing?

513
00:37:42,359 --> 00:37:43,750
It's just a photo!'

514
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:44,750
'Be quiet!'

515
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:46,880
they told her.

516
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,930
'Don't you understand anything?

517
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:53,270
Your house is very radioactive.

518
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:56,480
The walls are "hot" too.

519
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:00,960
We can't leave anything in the house; it's
not safe.

520
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,530
Think of the people next door.

521
00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:09,300
Now we're going to lock the house and nobody
must go in again.

522
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:14,859
Phone your friend Paula and tell her to find
somewhere to sleep tonight.

523
00:38:14,859 --> 00:38:17,420
Don't tell her too much.

524
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:20,329
Nobody must know what's happened here.

525
00:38:20,329 --> 00:38:25,680
People won't understand and they'll begin
to worry and get afraid.

526
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,310
That's not good for the factory.'

527
00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:30,240
'The factory...?

528
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:33,280
Who cares about the factory?

529
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,940
What about me?

530
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:41,470
If my house is radioactive, I'm radioactive
too,' said Karen.

531
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:47,280
'Why didn't you think of that before you stole
the uranium?

532
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,819
Go to your boyfriend's house.

533
00:38:49,819 --> 00:38:51,400
Don't go out.

534
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,630
Don't speak to anyone.

535
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:59,950
We'll phone you tomorrow and tell you what
to do.'

536
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:04,960
They put all the bags in the car and drove
away.

537
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,350
Karen stood alone in the middle of the street.

538
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:10,829
They thought she was a thief.

539
00:39:10,829 --> 00:39:12,900
But why?

540
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:18,040
Who could want to take uranium out of the
factory?

541
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:22,670
Everyone knew how stupid and dangerous that
was.

542
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:26,510
She looked silently at her empty house.

543
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:39,950
Now there was nothing in her home - only a
brown envelope in a hole in the wall.

544
00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:46,150
CHAPTER EIGHT
Where to go?

545
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:48,660
Karen tried to think.

546
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:51,310
She was 'hot'.

547
00:39:51,310 --> 00:39:53,619
Perhaps she was dying.

548
00:39:53,619 --> 00:39:58,940
She was dangerous to other people, dangerous
to Drew.

549
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:01,150
She couldn't phone him.

550
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:03,690
She was alone.

551
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:07,060
She forgot about Pete in Washington.

552
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:11,280
She sat down on the ground and cried.

553
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:15,300
She wanted to die quickly.

554
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:20,080
Three hours later Drew found her there.

555
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:23,309
She was still sitting on the ground.

556
00:40:23,309 --> 00:40:26,829
Her face was white and empty.

557
00:40:26,829 --> 00:40:31,200
She didn't look up when he walked across to
her.

558
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:37,400
'Karen, my Karen, come with me at once.

559
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,890
Someone from the factory phoned me.

560
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:42,090
I know everything.

561
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:46,470
Karen... look at me.'

562
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:49,170
"Don't come near me.

563
00:40:49,170 --> 00:40:51,470
I'm dangerous to you.'

564
00:40:51,470 --> 00:40:53,430
'Don't be stupid.

565
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:56,660
I talked to the doctor at the factory.

566
00:40:56,660 --> 00:41:01,060
He says you're not dangerous to anyone.

567
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:07,880
You've had a shower, so your body's not radioactive
now.'

568
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:10,410
Karen looked up into his face.

569
00:41:10,410 --> 00:41:13,839
'And you believe him?

570
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:18,370
Do you still believe anybody in that place?

571
00:41:18,370 --> 00:41:23,780
Do you also believe I stole uranium from the
factory?'

572
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:26,860
'Of course not.

573
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:29,579
Did they say that to you?

574
00:41:29,579 --> 00:41:32,520
That's terrible!

575
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:35,170
Wait until tomorrow.

576
00:41:35,170 --> 00:41:41,170
When I get in there, they'll be sorry they
ever said that to you.'

577
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:49,050
'It's no good, Drew, I'm dying,' said Karen
quietly.

578
00:41:49,050 --> 00:41:55,700
'I don't know how this happened, but I know
one thing.

579
00:41:55,700 --> 00:42:00,329
There are people at that factory who want
to see me dead.'

580
00:42:00,329 --> 00:42:02,460
'Karen... you're tired.

581
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:06,819
You need a holiday.

582
00:42:06,819 --> 00:42:10,710
You must leave the factory like me.

583
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:13,030
Come home with me now.'

584
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:14,290
'Home?

585
00:42:14,290 --> 00:42:19,400
I haven't got a home anymore.'

586
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:22,890
Karen put her head in her hands.

587
00:42:22,890 --> 00:42:26,050
Drew looked at the empty house.

588
00:42:26,050 --> 00:42:28,869
His face was white and angry.

589
00:42:28,869 --> 00:42:33,840
'Did they do that, too?

590
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,200
Karen...

591
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:40,190
my home is your home from now on.'

592
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:45,640
He took both Karen's hands and pulled her
to her feet.

593
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:56,310
He helped her to his car, and took her home.

594
00:42:56,310 --> 00:43:03,530
CHAPTER NINE
Karen explains to Drew

595
00:43:03,530 --> 00:43:07,540
That night Karen and Drew couldn't sleep.

596
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:09,770
They had to talk.

597
00:43:09,770 --> 00:43:15,059
'How did your house get so radioactive?

598
00:43:15,059 --> 00:43:18,010
That's the question,' said Drew.

599
00:43:18,010 --> 00:43:27,319
'I think,' answered Karen, 'that someone put
something radioactive into my bag last night

600
00:43:27,319 --> 00:43:29,530
before I left the factory.

601
00:43:29,530 --> 00:43:36,130
I remember that I left my bag on the table
for a few minutes at coffee time in the afternoon.'

602
00:43:36,130 --> 00:43:41,670
'But, Karen, who did that?

603
00:43:41,670 --> 00:43:43,930
And why?'

604
00:43:43,930 --> 00:43:49,890
'Drew, I'm going to tell you something.

605
00:43:49,890 --> 00:43:56,410
Perhaps I'm dying now, so there mustn't be
any secrets between us anymore.

606
00:43:56,410 --> 00:44:03,940
I agreed to get photos of the fuel rods for
the Union in Washington.

607
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:09,920
I've stolen photos and negatives from the
photographic laboratory.

608
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:14,099
Perhaps someone saw me... one of the managers.'

609
00:44:14,099 --> 00:44:17,800
'You've stolen photos?

610
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,920
What photos?

611
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,930
Why?'

612
00:44:21,930 --> 00:44:24,750
Karen explained everything to Drew.

613
00:44:24,750 --> 00:44:28,690
He was very quiet when she finished.

614
00:44:28,690 --> 00:44:32,230
In the end, he took her hand.

615
00:44:32,230 --> 00:44:36,970
'Karen, this is very dangerous.

616
00:44:36,970 --> 00:44:39,670
I'm afraid for you.

617
00:44:39,670 --> 00:44:42,859
Perhaps someone does want to kill you.

618
00:44:42,859 --> 00:44:47,589
Didn't you think of that danger when the Union
asked you to do this?

619
00:44:47,589 --> 00:44:50,130
Why did you agree to do it?'

620
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:53,500
'Because I care, Drew.

621
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:55,170
Somebody has to do something.

622
00:44:55,170 --> 00:44:57,500
Why not me?

623
00:44:57,500 --> 00:45:04,349
I care about you, about Susan, about everyone
who has ever worked at that factory.

624
00:45:04,349 --> 00:45:11,960
If the danger from radioactive dust doesn't
stop, perhaps we'll all die.

625
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:13,780
Don't you understand that?'

626
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:19,059
'Yes, I understand,' said Drew quietly.

627
00:45:19,059 --> 00:45:27,430
'But I also understand that you're doing a
difficult and dangerous job alone.

628
00:45:27,430 --> 00:45:31,050
You mustn't work alone anymore.

629
00:45:31,050 --> 00:45:34,250
I'll be with you all the time.

630
00:45:34,250 --> 00:45:38,250
Nobody is going to hurt you again.'

631
00:45:38,250 --> 00:45:39,819
Karen smiled.

632
00:45:39,819 --> 00:45:42,280
'I was right to tell you.

633
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:48,550
I need a friend, and you are the best friend
that I have.

634
00:45:48,550 --> 00:45:51,980
But it's not much longer now.

635
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:56,610
After the meeting with the New York Times,
everything will be finished.

636
00:45:56,610 --> 00:46:00,450
I can go on for a few more days.

637
00:46:00,450 --> 00:46:06,320
But I'll tell you everything from now on.'

638
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:14,170
Next morning Karen telephoned Pete in Washington
and the Union Committee at the factory.

639
00:46:14,170 --> 00:46:20,290
She told them about her house and that the
managers were calling her a thief.

640
00:46:20,290 --> 00:46:25,369
From Washington Pete's voice sounded angry
and worried.

641
00:46:25,369 --> 00:46:29,760
'The factory's managers are trying to sack
you.

642
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:33,750
Say nothing, do nothing.

643
00:46:33,750 --> 00:46:38,910
We'll speak to them and tell them that we
know what's happened to you.

644
00:46:38,910 --> 00:46:45,530
You must have medical tests, and we'll tell
them that.'

645
00:46:45,530 --> 00:46:48,040
Karen waited at Drew's house all day.

646
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:51,260
In the evening the phone rang.

647
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:56,880
'Miss Silkwood?' said Mr Bailey's cold voice.

648
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:04,930
'You and Drew and your friend Paula must go
to Los Alamos for tests.

649
00:47:04,930 --> 00:47:11,300
The doctors there know all about uranium and
radioactive dust.

650
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:14,480
We've talked to the Union.

651
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:19,980
We will pay for the journey and they will
pay for the tests.

652
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:28,520
But we know that you've stolen some uranium
- that's why you were so radioactive.

653
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:31,849
There's no other answer.'

654
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:35,060
The phone line went dead.

655
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:38,599
Karen looked at Drew.

656
00:47:38,599 --> 00:47:43,400
'You and I are going to Los Alamos for medical
tests.

657
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:47,890
But I'm sure now... the managers know.

658
00:47:47,890 --> 00:47:51,359
They know what I've really stolen.

659
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:54,470
And they'll look for them while we're away.

660
00:47:54,470 --> 00:47:59,010
They'll tell everyone that they're looking
for the stolen uranium.

661
00:47:59,010 --> 00:48:02,590
But they won't find anything.

662
00:48:02,590 --> 00:48:11,089
They won't find their negatives.'

663
00:48:11,089 --> 00:48:14,369
CHAPTER TEN
The night drive

664
00:48:14,369 --> 00:48:22,809
Karen, Paula and Drew went to Los Alamos and
had the tests.

665
00:48:22,809 --> 00:48:28,890
The doctors said that Karen's body was still
a little radioactive, but Drew and Paula were

666
00:48:28,890 --> 00:48:30,940
all right.

667
00:48:30,940 --> 00:48:33,750
It was very good news.

668
00:48:33,750 --> 00:48:37,680
They told Karen that she was in no danger
now.

669
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:41,859
But they also explained that they didn't know
about the future.

670
00:48:41,859 --> 00:48:50,170
'It will be a few years,' they said, 'before
we know that you're really all right.'

671
00:48:50,170 --> 00:49:00,910
High in the mountains around Los Alamos, Paula,
Drew and Karen had a party in a little restaurant.

672
00:49:00,910 --> 00:49:03,560
Karen felt years younger.

673
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:06,480
She was not going to die.

674
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:10,550
She and Drew still had a Future together.

675
00:49:10,550 --> 00:49:14,420
They all danced until midnight.

676
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:19,849
The next day they took the plane back to Oklahoma
City.

677
00:49:19,849 --> 00:49:25,069
Karen had to go back because that evening
there was a Union meeting at the factory and

678
00:49:25,069 --> 00:49:32,160
after that, her meeting with Pete and the
journalist from the New York Times.

679
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:36,040
It was an important day for her.

680
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:38,839
They arrived at the airport in the morning.

681
00:49:38,839 --> 00:49:44,230
Early in the evening Karen drove to her house.

682
00:49:44,230 --> 00:49:48,020
She went alone because Drew was working.

683
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:53,319
She used her key and went quietly into the
house.

684
00:49:53,319 --> 00:49:59,320
She was only inside the house for three minutes
and then she left immediately and went to

685
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:03,690
the Union meeting at the factory.

686
00:50:03,690 --> 00:50:10,880
That night at the meeting, Karen had a big
brown envelope in her bag.

687
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:17,299
The envelope was too big for the bag, so everyone
could see it.

688
00:50:17,299 --> 00:50:22,500
All the workers were very happy to hear that
Karen was all right.

689
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:29,610
They were afraid that she was very ill, so
when they saw her looking happy and well,

690
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:31,430
everyone felt better.

691
00:50:31,430 --> 00:50:37,530
'She looks as happy as she did a year ago,'
thought Susan.

692
00:50:37,530 --> 00:50:45,250
'A pretty, happy girl, who likes a good time
and a good laugh.'

693
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:50,940
After the meeting a lot of people wanted to
talk to Karen and ask her about the last few

694
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:52,000
days.

695
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,849
'I'm sorry,' she said.

696
00:50:54,849 --> 00:50:57,410
'I can't talk to you now.

697
00:50:57,410 --> 00:51:00,830
I have to go to another meeting.'

698
00:51:00,830 --> 00:51:07,340
"With your good-looking Drew?' asked someone
with a friendly laugh.

699
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:09,470
'Yes,' said Karen.

700
00:51:09,470 --> 00:51:11,410
'With Drew.

701
00:51:11,410 --> 00:51:14,450
And one or two other people.'

702
00:51:14,450 --> 00:51:17,050
She smiled.

703
00:51:17,050 --> 00:51:21,070
'Can I take you in my car?' asked her friend
Bob.

704
00:51:21,070 --> 00:51:23,599
'No, thanks,' said Karen.

705
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:28,720
'I've got my car here.'

706
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:32,690
It was dark when Karen left the factory.

707
00:51:32,690 --> 00:51:42,010
She smiled at all her friends, got into her
small white car and drove away.

708
00:51:42,010 --> 00:51:47,390
Karen never arrived at her meeting with Drew,
Pete and the journalist from the New York

709
00:51:47,390 --> 00:51:49,530
Times.

710
00:51:49,530 --> 00:51:55,990
On the road to the meeting, a few miles from
the nuclear factory, she had an accident by

711
00:51:55,990 --> 00:51:59,200
a wall near a river.

712
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:05,140
It was November 13th, 1974.

713
00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:07,690
Nobody ever found the brown envelope.

714
00:52:07,690 --> 00:52:08,310
- THE END -
