00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:05,660
CHAPTER ONE
A horse called Silver Blaze

2
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:12,099
'I must go down there, Watson.

3
00:00:12,099 --> 00:00:19,000
I must,' said Sherlock Holmes at the breakfast
table on Thursday morning.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,620
'Go?

5
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:21,910
Go where?'

6
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:23,609
I asked.

7
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:28,279
'To Dartmoor - to King's Pyland.'

8
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:30,070
'Ah!

9
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:33,860
So that's it,' I said.

10
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:41,440
'Well, everybody in the country is talking
about the case at King's Pyland.'

11
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:46,870
I always know when Holmes is interested in
a case.

12
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:55,820
He reads all the newspapers, he walks up and
down, up and down the room, and does not speak

13
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:58,620
for hours.

14
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:02,420
He did all those things yesterday.

15
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:13,190
He did not answer any of my questions, but
I knew that it was the mystery at King's Pyland.

16
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:17,260
The morning newspapers were on the breakfast
table.

17
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:22,340
'What is happening at King's Pyland?

18
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:24,650
Where is Silver Blaze?'

19
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:26,190
they asked.

20
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:29,320
'Who killed John Straker?

21
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,060
What are the police doing?

22
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:40,460
Can they find the horse before the big race
next week?'

23
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:48,909
Silver Blaze was a famous racehorse, and John
Straker was his trainer.

24
00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:56,909
One of the biggest horse races of the year
- the Wessex Cup - was next week, and Silver

25
00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:01,150
Blaze was the favourite to win.

26
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:09,250
But on Monday night at King's Pyland two things
happened.

27
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:16,670
Someone killed John Straker, and Silver Blaze
disappeared.

28
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:21,579
I was interested in this case too.

29
00:02:21,579 --> 00:02:26,799
'Do you need my help, Holmes?'

30
00:02:26,799 --> 00:02:27,799
I asked.

31
00:02:27,799 --> 00:02:30,290
'I would very much like to come with you.'

32
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:38,640
'My dear Watson,' said Holmes, 'of course
you must come with me.

33
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:48,310
We can catch the twelve o'clock from Paddington,
and talk about the case on the train.'

34
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:53,980
Two hours later we were on the train to Tavistock.

35
00:02:53,980 --> 00:03:01,180
We read all the midday newspapers, but there
was nothing new in them.

36
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:07,859
'So, Watson, what do you think about this
case?'

37
00:03:07,859 --> 00:03:10,980
'Well, the newspapers say-'

38
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:13,739
'Ah, yes.

39
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:18,379
The newspapers understand nothing.

40
00:03:18,379 --> 00:03:25,269
One day they say one thing, the next day they
say another.

41
00:03:25,269 --> 00:03:30,160
But we must look at the case more carefully.

42
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:35,180
What did happen on Monday night at King's
Pyland?

43
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:39,599
And what did not happen?

44
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,440
That's an important question too.'

45
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:46,560
'Do the police have any answers?'

46
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,389
I asked.

47
00:03:48,389 --> 00:03:50,890
'No,' said Holmes.

48
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:56,290
'On Wednesday morning I had two letters.

49
00:03:56,290 --> 00:04:04,340
One was from Mr Ross, the owner of the horse,
and the other was from the Dartmoor police

50
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:08,599
- an Inspector Gregory.

51
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:11,489
They ask for my help.'

52
00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:14,470
'Wednesday morning!'

53
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:16,590
I cried.

54
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:20,359
'But this is Thursday morning.

55
00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:23,740
Why didn't you go down yesterday?'

56
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:28,300
'Because it was an easy case.

57
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:33,120
You can't hide a famous horse for long, I
thought.

58
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,650
Where can you hide a horse on Dartmoor?

59
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:42,800
There are no buildings, no trees...

60
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,210
But I was wrong, Watson.

61
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:56,650
The case is now two days old, and nobody can
find the horse - or Straker's killer.

62
00:04:56,650 --> 00:05:03,729
So here we are, on the train to Tavistock.'

63
00:05:03,729 --> 00:05:06,810
'And what do you think about it all?'

64
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:08,630
I said.

65
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:14,229
'Well, Watson, let's look at the case.

66
00:05:14,229 --> 00:05:24,919
First, we have a racehorse, Silver Blaze - only
five years old, but already a winner in many

67
00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:27,699
big races.

68
00:05:27,699 --> 00:05:35,400
His owner, Mr Ross, is a happy man - and rich.

69
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,759
The racegoers are happy too.

70
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:48,750
Silver Blaze nearly always wins his races,
and so people put big bets on him to win.

71
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:57,270
And when the favourite wins the race, a lot
of people make money on their bets.

72
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:04,009
But what happens when the favourite doesn't
win, Watson?

73
00:06:04,009 --> 00:06:05,199
What then?'

74
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,262
'A lot of people lose their money, of course,'
I said.

75
00:06:08,262 --> 00:06:09,262
'And people with big bets on a different horse
can make much more money, when that other

76
00:06:09,262 --> 00:06:10,262
horse wins.'

77
00:06:10,262 --> 00:06:11,262
'Right, Watson!

78
00:06:11,262 --> 00:06:12,262
So perhaps some people are very interested
in Silver Blaze not running in the Wessex

79
00:06:12,262 --> 00:06:13,262
Cup.

80
00:06:13,262 --> 00:06:14,262
Of course, Mr Ross and his trainer, John Straker,
know that, and they watch the horse very carefully.

81
00:06:14,262 --> 00:06:15,262
'Now, let's look at the people and the place.

82
00:06:15,262 --> 00:06:16,262
The trainer, John Straker - a good man and
wonderful with horses - worked for Mr Ross

83
00:06:16,262 --> 00:06:17,262
for twelve years.

84
00:06:17,262 --> 00:06:18,262
There are four horses in the training stables,
and three boys working for Straker.

85
00:06:18,262 --> 00:06:19,262
One of them sits up all night with the horses,
and the other two sleep in a room over the

86
00:06:19,262 --> 00:06:20,262
stables.

87
00:06:20,262 --> 00:06:21,262
We know nothing bad about any of the boys.

88
00:06:21,262 --> 00:06:22,262
'Straker has a wife, no children, and lives
- I mean, lived - in a house about two hundred

89
00:06:22,262 --> 00:06:23,262
metres from the stables.

90
00:06:23,262 --> 00:06:24,262
The town of Tavistock is two kilometres to
the west, and about two kilometres to the

91
00:06:24,262 --> 00:06:25,262
East there is Capleton, another training stables.

92
00:06:25,262 --> 00:06:26,262
The owner there is Lord Backwater, and the
trainer is Silas Brown.

93
00:06:26,262 --> 00:06:27,262
There are no other houses - just the hills
of Dartmoor.'

94
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:28,262
I listened carefully.

95
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:29,262
I wanted to remember it all because Holmes
does not like to say anything twice.

96
00:06:29,262 --> 00:06:30,262
'Now,' he said, 'what happened on Monday night?

97
00:06:30,262 --> 00:06:31,262
These papers came with Inspector Gregory's
letter.

98
00:06:31,262 --> 00:06:32,262
The best thing is for you to read them, Watson.

99
00:06:32,262 --> 00:06:33,262
Then tell me what you think.'

100
00:06:33,262 --> 00:06:34,262
I took the papers from him, and began to read.

101
00:06:34,262 --> 00:06:35,262
CHAPTER TWO
Monday night at Kind's Pyland

102
00:06:35,262 --> 00:06:45,319
Notes by Inspector Gregory, after talking
to Edith Baxter; Ned Hunter, Mrs John Straker,

103
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:50,469
and Mr Fitzroy Simpson.

104
00:06:50,469 --> 00:06:59,750
On Monday evening Straker locked the stables
at nine o'clock, the usual time.

105
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:09,669
Two of the boys then walked up to the trainer's
house for their dinner, but the third boy,

106
00:07:09,669 --> 00:07:16,990
Ned Hunter, stayed in the stables to watch
the horses.

107
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:27,819
At five past nine, the Strakers' servant,
a girl called Edith Baxter, carried Ned Hunter's

108
00:07:27,819 --> 00:07:31,439
dinner down to the stables.

109
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:37,860
The dinner that night was a hot meat curry.

110
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:46,090
Edith was nearly at the stables when a man
called out to her.

111
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:55,870
He came up to her, and she saw a tall man
in a grey suit and a hat, and a red and black

112
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:57,889
scarf.

113
00:07:57,889 --> 00:08:04,759
He carried a big walking stick, and Edith
felt afraid of him.

114
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:08,759
'Where am I?' the man asked.

115
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:11,210
'What is this place?'

116
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:18,560
'This is King's Pyland training stables,'
she said.

117
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,610
'Good!' said the man.

118
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:29,280
'Now, a stable boy sleeps here every night
- is that right?

119
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:34,060
And I think you're taking his dinner to him
now.'

120
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:37,690
He took an envelope out of his pocket.

121
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:46,620
'Please give the boy this, and you can have
some money for a beautiful new dress.'

122
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:50,470
Edith did not take the envelope.

123
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:58,130
She ran past the man to the stables and up
to a small open window.

124
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:05,070
She always put the boy's dinner through this
window, and Ned Hunter was there, ready to

125
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:06,440
take it.

126
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,600
'Oh Ned!'

127
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:17,410
Edith cried, but before she could say any
more, the stranger came up behind her.

128
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:22,600
'Good evening' he said through the window
to the boy.

129
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,970
'I want to talk to you.'

130
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:28,730
'Who are you?

131
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:30,680
What do you want?'

132
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,530
Ned Hunter said.

133
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:38,670
'I want to make you rich, boy' the stranger
said.

134
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:44,230
'You help me, and I help you.

135
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:52,620
You have two horses in for the Wessex Cup
- Silver Blaze and Bayard.

136
00:09:52,620 --> 00:10:00,680
I hear that Bayard is the better horse, and
that you stable boys are putting your bets

137
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,800
on him to win.

138
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,450
Am I right?'

139
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:10,500
'I'm not saying anything' cried Ned Hunter.

140
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:17,370
'We don't talk about our horses at King's
Pyland, so get out!

141
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:22,090
I'm getting the dog now!'

142
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:32,310
Ned ran across the stables to get the dog,
and Edith began to run back to the house.

143
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:40,420
But she looked back after about thirty metres,
and saw the man at the little window, with

144
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:46,500
his head and one arm inside the room.

145
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:56,450
Edith ran on, and a minute later, Ned came
out of the building and locked the door behind

146
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:58,020
him.

147
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:06,950
He ran all round the stables with the dog,
but the man was gone.

148
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:16,240
Ned Hunter told the trainer and the other
boys about the stranger, but no one saw him

149
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,550
again.

150
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:27,270
The next thing happened at one o'clock in
the morning when John Straker got out of bed.

151
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:30,800
'What's the matter?' said his wife.

152
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,400
'Where are you going?'

153
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:37,500
'To the stables' Straker said.

154
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:42,450
'I can't stop thinking about that stranger.

155
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:44,970
I just want to have a look around.'

156
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:48,870
'But it's raining.

157
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:53,220
Wait until the rain stops,' she said.

158
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:57,140
'No, no' Straker said.

159
00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:01,620
'I want to go now.'

160
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:08,210
He left the house and Mrs Straker went back
to sleep.

161
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:15,950
At seven in the morning she woke up, but her
husband was not there.

162
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:25,550
She quickly got up, called the servant, Edith,
and they ran down to the stables.

163
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:29,920
They found the stables unlocked.

164
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:40,960
Straker was not there, and inside, on a chair,
Ned Hunter slept like a dead man.

165
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:48,800
Silver Blaze was gone, and his stable door
was open.

166
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:53,410
They called the other two boys from the room
over the stables.

167
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:59,740
They were good sleepers and heard nothing
in the night.

168
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:07,860
Nobody could wake Ned Hunter, so the two women
and the boys ran out to look for the trainer

169
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:10,880
and the horse.

170
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:19,450
Five hundred metres from the stables, they
saw Straker's coat on a small tree.

171
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:25,980
Down the hill, just past the tree, they found
the trainer.

172
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:28,800
He was dead.

173
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:36,690
There was a long cut in his leg, and his head
was broken in three places.

174
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:46,260
In his right hand he had a small knife, with
blood all over it, and in his left hand he

175
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:50,880
had a red and black scarf.

176
00:13:50,880 --> 00:14:00,240
Edith Baxter knew the scarf at once, and later,
so did Ned Hunter.

177
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,370
'It's the stranger's scarf,' he told us.

178
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:11,770
'When I went to get the dog, that stranger
was still at the stable window.

179
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:19,621
He put something in my meat curry, to make
me sleep know he did.

180
00:14:19,621 --> 00:14:26,390
Edith saw him, with his arm through the window.'

181
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:31,070
Ned Hunter was right about his meat curry.

182
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:38,090
There was some of his dinner left, and we
found a lot of opium in it.

183
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:43,840
That's why Ned slept like a dead man.

184
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,620
What about the horse?

185
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:53,460
We found his tracks in the mud, next to Straker's
dead body.

186
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:57,320
But what happened then?

187
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:03,210
Someone hit Straker on the head, and killed
him.

188
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:07,700
Did that person take the horse away?

189
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:12,140
Did the horse run away?

190
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:21,190
Everybody on Dartmoor is looking for Silver
Blaze, but there is no news of him.

191
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:29,140
When I began work on the case on Tuesday,
we looked for the stranger.

192
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:35,190
He was in Tavistock, and we found him easily.

193
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:40,050
His name is Fitzroy Simpson.

194
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:48,310
He lives mostly in London, and makes his money
at the races, taking bets.

195
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:56,370
We looked in his betting-book, and found a
number of big bets - five thousand pounds

196
00:15:56,370 --> 00:16:03,350
- against the favourite for the Wessex Cup.

197
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:06,810
These were his answers to my questions.

198
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:12,130
'Why did you come down to Dartmoor?'

199
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:14,780
'I'm a betting man, Inspector.

200
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:24,930
I need to know about the horses for the Wessex
Cup - Silver Blaze, Bayard, and Desborough,

201
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:28,580
the horse at Silas Brown's stables.

202
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:32,640
He's the second favourite for the race, you
see.'

203
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:39,930
'Did you go to the King's Pyland stables late
on Monday evening?'

204
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:42,630
'Yes, I did.

205
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:47,130
I just wanted to ask the stable boys some
questions.

206
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:49,820
They know the horses better than anyone.'

207
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:55,110
'And is this your scarf?'

208
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:59,550
'Yes... yes, it is.'

209
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:07,089
'And how did it get into the dead man's hand,
Mr Simpson?

210
00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:09,650
Can you tell us that?'

211
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:15,020
'I don't know, Inspector, I don't know!

212
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:17,380
I never saw the man.

213
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:20,880
I lost my scarf in the dark.

214
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:26,860
It wasn't me, Inspector, it wasn't me!'

215
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:35,630
We asked many more questions, but Fitzroy
Simpson did not change his story.

216
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:43,510
He was out at King's Pyland that night, his
suit was still wet from the rain, and his

217
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:49,260
big walking stick could break a man's head
open.

218
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:58,130
But there were no cuts on his body, so where
did the blood on Straker's knife come from?

219
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:20,660
And where is the horse?

220
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:24,900
CHAPTER THREE
John Stroller's pockets

221
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:33,070
'Mmm, very interesting,' I said.

222
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:39,680
I gave the papers back to Holmes, and he put
them away.

223
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:46,540
'So, Watson, what can you tell me?' he asked.

224
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:49,180
I thought for a minute.

225
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:53,900
'This cut on Straker's leg.

226
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:57,720
Perhaps he did it with his own knife.

227
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:03,910
When something hits you very hard on the head,
and you have a knife in your hand...

228
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:06,120
It can happen, you know.'

229
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:09,360
'Very good, Watson.

230
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:13,690
And that's bad news for Fitzroy Simpson.'

231
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:18,440
'So did Simpson do it, do you think?'

232
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,320
I said.

233
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,230
'Perhaps,' said Holmes.

234
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:27,460
'Let's look at it.

235
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:32,010
Simpson puts opium in the boy's dinner.

236
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:37,540
He goes away and comes back later in the night.

237
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:45,470
He gets into the stables, takes the horse
out, and leaves.

238
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:52,110
But the trainer arrives at that moment, sees
him, and follows him.

239
00:19:52,110 --> 00:20:02,110
The two men fight, and Simpson breaks Straker's
head open with his stick.

240
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:08,650
Then Simpson takes the horse - but where?

241
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:12,520
Or did the horse run away?

242
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:15,390
Is it still out on the moor?

243
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:21,240
And how did Simpson get into the locked stables?

244
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:27,500
I don't know, Watson, I don't know.

245
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:32,500
We must wait and see.'

246
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:39,360
When we arrived at Tavistock station, two
men came to meet us.

247
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:47,480
Inspector Gregory was a tall, slow-moving
man with blue eyes, and Mr Ross was small

248
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,630
and quick.

249
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:52,750
He was the first to speak.

250
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:57,860
'Very pleased to see you, Mr Holmes.

251
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:03,240
The Inspector here is working hard, but we
need help.

252
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:09,750
We must find poor Straker's killer, and I
want to find my horse.'

253
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:15,090
'Is there any news?' asked Holmes.

254
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:19,530
'Let's talk on the way,' the Inspector said.

255
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:25,880
'I'd like you to see everything in the daylight.'

256
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:33,150
We were soon out of the little town and up
on the brown hills of the moor.

257
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:38,960
Inspector Gregory thought that the killer
was Fitzroy Simpson.

258
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:43,890
'Simpson was out in the rain that night.

259
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:48,770
His suit was still wet on the Tuesday,' he
said.

260
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:56,830
'He had a big stick, and his scarf was in
the dead man's hand.

261
00:21:56,830 --> 00:22:03,220
That looks bad, Mr Holmes, very bad.'

262
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:05,350
Holmes smiled.

263
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:08,360
'You need more than that, Inspector.

264
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:12,840
The servant, Edith, spoke of an envelope.

265
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:16,420
Did Simpson say anything about that?'

266
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:24,900
'Yes, he said it had money in it - a ten-pound
note for the stable boy.'

267
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:30,830
'What about this other training stables, at
Capleton?'

268
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:32,600
asked Holmes.

269
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:35,800
'Does Simpson have friends there?'

270
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:39,730
'No, we don't think so.

271
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:42,690
We went to Capleton, of course.

272
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:53,790
Their horse, Desborough, is the second favourite
for the Wessex Cup, and Silas Brown, the trainer,

273
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:57,440
was not friendly with Straker.

274
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,760
But we found nothing.'

275
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:10,390
When we arrived at King's Pyland, Inspector
Gregory took us into the trainer's house.

276
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:14,700
'Straker's body is upstairs,' he said.

277
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:23,870
'But we have here the things from his pockets
and from the ground next to his body.

278
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:27,200
Would you like to see them, Mr Holmes?'

279
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:32,080
'Very much,' said Holmes.

280
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:41,470
We went into the front room, and the Inspector
opened a box and put things on a table.

281
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:54,270
There was a box of matches, a small piece
of candle, some money, a watch, some papers,

282
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:57,340
and a small, thin knife.

283
00:23:57,340 --> 00:24:02,420
'This is a strange knife,' Holmes said.

284
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:06,320
He looked at it carefully, and then gave it
to me.

285
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:10,080
'What is it, Watson?'

286
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,710
'It's an eye knife,' I said.

287
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:18,240
'Doctors use these when they cut into an eye.

288
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,580
You don't usually see them outside a hospital.'

289
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:25,570
'Mm,' said Holmes.

290
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:29,690
'So why did Straker take this knife?

291
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:32,770
It's no good for fighting.'

292
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:40,580
'His wife says it was in the bedroom for some
days,' said Inspector Gregory.

293
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:45,970
'Perhaps he just took it because it was there
on the table.'

294
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:48,540
'Perhaps,' said Holmes.

295
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:51,290
'What about these papers?'

296
00:24:51,290 --> 00:25:00,309
'One is a letter from Mr Ross, the others
are bills,' the Inspector said.

297
00:25:00,309 --> 00:25:09,630
'Three of them are bills for the horses' food,
and this one is a bill from a dress-maker

298
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:15,400
in London, for a Mr William Darbyshire.

299
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:19,640
He was a friend of Straker's, his wife tells
us.

300
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:26,840
His letters sometimes came here, and Straker
sent them on.'

301
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:35,860
'Mrs William Darbyshire is an expensive lady,'
said Holmes, looking at the bill.

302
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:42,660
'Twenty-five pounds is a lot of money, for
just one dress and one hat.'

303
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:47,700
He put the bill down and moved to the window.

304
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:56,990
'Inspector, can we go out on the moor now,
before the light begins to go?'

305
00:25:56,990 --> 00:26:02,940
We left the room and at the front door we
saw a woman.

306
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:09,350
She came up to Inspector Gregory and put her
hand on his arm.

307
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:12,270
'Is there any news?'

308
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:14,120
she said.

309
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:24,920
'No, Mrs Straker, but here is Mr Holmes, the
famous detective from London.

310
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,450
We have him to help us now.'

311
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:36,300
'I think I met you a month or two ago, Mrs
Straker,' said Holmes.

312
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:38,090
'Let me see...

313
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:42,150
Yes, it was in Plymouth, at a garden-party.

314
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:45,720
Do you remember?'

315
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:48,740
'No, sir.

316
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:51,630
That wasn't me.'

317
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:54,590
'But I remember so well...

318
00:26:54,590 --> 00:27:02,840
You had a blue dress, and a dark blue hat
with white flowers on it.'

319
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:09,920
'I don't have a hat with flowers on it, sir,'
Mrs Straker said.

320
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:14,850
'Well, well, I am wrong, then.

321
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:17,700
I am so sorry.'

322
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:24,010
And with that Holmes followed the Inspector
outside.

323
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:31,600
The four of us then walked past the stables
and up onto the moor.

324
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:35,590
After ten minutes Inspector Gregory stopped.

325
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:40,530
'Here we are,' he said.

326
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:45,170
'Straker's body was just down there.

327
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:49,080
His coat was here, on this small tree-'

328
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:52,670
'On the tree?

329
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:55,340
Not on the ground?'

330
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,640
Holmes asked.

331
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,410
'Oh no.

332
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:04,820
It was on the tree, carefully away from the
mud on the ground.'

333
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:06,799
'Mmm.

334
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:09,860
Interesting,' said Holmes.

335
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:15,500
'Now, I must look at the mud down there.'

336
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:24,690
'Ah,' said Inspector Gregory, 'and to help
you, I have here in this bag one of Straker's

337
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:32,740
shoes, one of Fitzroy Simpson's shoes, and
one of Silver Blaze's horseshoes.'

338
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:39,010
'My dear Inspector, well done!'

339
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:40,520
Holmes was very pleased.

340
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:45,460
'You think of everything.'

341
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:52,710
For some minutes Holmes looked carefully at
the ground, his eyes only centimetres away

342
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:55,060
from the mud.

343
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:58,790
'Hello!' he said suddenly.

344
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:01,530
'What's this?'

345
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:08,030
From out of the mud he took a match, or a
small piece of one.

346
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:13,630
'Now why didn't I find that?' said the Inspector.

347
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:19,570
'I knew it was there, you see,' said Holmes.

348
00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:22,470
'You knew?

349
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:26,830
But how could you know that?'

350
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:31,130
Holmes smiled but did not answer.

351
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:38,850
He then took the shoes, got down on the ground,
and began to look at all the tracks in the

352
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:40,920
mud.

353
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:49,390
We stood and watched him, but after five minutes
Mr Ross looked at his watch.

354
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:59,070
'Er, this is very interesting, Mr Holmes,'
he said, 'but is it going to take a long time?'

355
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:02,410
'No,' said Holmes.

356
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:03,840
He got to his feet.

357
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:08,809
'I don't need to do any more here.

358
00:30:08,809 --> 00:30:17,450
Watson and I are going to take a little walk
across the moor now, with the horseshoe.'

359
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:21,510
Mr Ross looked at the Inspector.

360
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:25,140
'Can we go back to the house and talk?

361
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:33,420
I must take Silver Blaze's name out of the
Wessex Cup race - and do it today, I think.'

362
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:35,670
'Don't do that!'

363
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:37,450
cried Holmes.

364
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:44,660
'No, no, you must leave the horse's name in
for the race.'

365
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:46,200
'But...'

366
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,170
Mr Ross began.

367
00:30:48,170 --> 00:30:52,320
Then he laughed, a little angrily.

368
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,380
'Well, thank you, Mr Holmes.

369
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:58,150
Thank you for your help.

370
00:30:58,150 --> 00:31:02,300
See you later then, at the house.'

371
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:22,890
And he and the Inspector walked away.

372
00:31:22,890 --> 00:31:30,610
CHAPTER FOUR
Looking for a horse

373
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:35,330
Holmes and I walked slowly across the moor.

374
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:43,549
In the evening sunlight the autumn colours
on the hills were beautiful - reds and browns

375
00:31:43,549 --> 00:31:46,059
and yellows.

376
00:31:46,059 --> 00:31:49,880
But Holmes saw nothing of that.

377
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:59,350
'So, Watson,' he said, 'let's forget John
Straker for a minute, and think about the

378
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:01,450
horse.

379
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:04,550
Horses are friendly animals.

380
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:09,630
Let's say that Silver Blaze runs away after
the killing.

381
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:15,820
Here he is, out on the cold wet moor.

382
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:18,940
What does he do next?'

383
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:25,760
'He looks for a nice warm stable,' I said,
'with food and water.'

384
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:29,870
'Right, Watson.

385
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:37,470
He didn't go back to King's Pyland, we know
that, but there is another stable not far

386
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:40,919
away, at Capleton.

387
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:43,090
Perhaps he went there.

388
00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:48,960
And the way to Capleton, Watson, is down this
hill.

389
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,120
Let's go!'

390
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:58,220
We walked quickly down the hill, and at the
bottom we found a small river and some very

391
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:00,520
wet ground.

392
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:03,100
'Wonderful,' said Holmes.

393
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:07,440
'I wanted mud, and here it is.

394
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,980
You follow the left side of the river, Watson.

395
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:16,620
We're looking for the tracks of horseshoes.'

396
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:21,270
We found them after only fifty metres.

397
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:26,850
Holmes took the horseshoe out of his pocket
and put it next to the tracks.

398
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:34,350
'Yes, that's Silver Blaze, no question about
it.'

399
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:42,179
We followed the tracks easily, then lost them
for a time, but found them again about two

400
00:33:42,179 --> 00:33:47,250
hundred metres from the Capleton stables.

401
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:50,320
'Here they are,' I cried.

402
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:57,790
'And look - there's another track here, of
a man's shoe.'

403
00:33:57,790 --> 00:33:59,580
Holmes got down to look.

404
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:02,160
'You're right, Watson.

405
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:08,409
And the man is walking next to the horse.'

406
00:34:08,409 --> 00:34:16,179
We followed the two tracks to Capleton stables,
and were still twenty metres away when a man

407
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:19,440
came out and called to us.

408
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,950
He had a red, angry face.

409
00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:25,149
'Go away!

410
00:34:25,149 --> 00:34:28,480
We don't want visitors here!

411
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,029
Go away!'

412
00:34:30,029 --> 00:34:33,979
'Mr Silas Brown?'

413
00:34:33,979 --> 00:34:35,369
Holmes said to him.

414
00:34:35,369 --> 00:34:39,429
'What do you want?' said the man.

415
00:34:39,429 --> 00:34:46,179
'I don't talk to newspaper people, so just
go away.'

416
00:34:46,179 --> 00:34:51,669
'We are not from a newspaper,' said Holmes,
smiling.

417
00:34:51,669 --> 00:34:58,240
'But you have a horse called Silver Blaze
in your stable.'

418
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:01,190
'That's not true!'

419
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:03,660
Mr Brown said angrily.

420
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:10,119
'Shall we go in and talk about it?' said Holmes.

421
00:35:10,119 --> 00:35:18,979
He did not wait for an answer, but took the
man's arm and moved quickly to the gate.

422
00:35:18,979 --> 00:35:29,099
He looked back at me and said quietly, 'Wait
for me here, Watson.'

423
00:35:29,099 --> 00:35:33,630
Twenty minutes later they came out again.

424
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:40,759
Holmes looked pleased, and Mr Silas Brown
was a different man.

425
00:35:40,759 --> 00:35:46,920
He looked smaller and older, and his face
was afraid.

426
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:57,630
'Remember,' said Holmes, 'you must be there
on the day, on time, and everything must be

427
00:35:57,630 --> 00:35:58,980
ready.'

428
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:04,220
'Yes, yes,' Silas Brown said quickly.

429
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:07,710
'You can be sure of it.

430
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:13,079
Oh yes, you can be sure of it.'

431
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:16,270
'Good,' said Holmes.

432
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:21,430
'Well, goodbye for now.'

433
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:29,079
Holmes and I then began to walk back to King's
Pyland along the road.

434
00:36:29,079 --> 00:36:31,809
'Does he have the horse, then?'

435
00:36:31,809 --> 00:36:33,430
I asked.

436
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:35,180
Holmes laughed.

437
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:36,869
'Yes.

438
00:36:36,869 --> 00:36:43,170
He said no at first, of course, but he's afraid
of the police.

439
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:49,229
He doesn't want them to know about this, and
I can help him with that.'

440
00:36:49,229 --> 00:36:53,579
'But why didn't the police find the horse?'

441
00:36:53,579 --> 00:36:55,619
I asked.

442
00:36:55,619 --> 00:37:00,200
'Inspector Gregory said they went to Capleton.'

443
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:06,180
'Oh, it's easy to change the colour of a horse's
coat.'

444
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:08,279
Holmes laughed again.

445
00:37:08,279 --> 00:37:18,440
'Gregory is a good policeman, but I don't
think he knows much about horses.'

446
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:21,259
'And why did Brown tell you?'

447
00:37:21,259 --> 00:37:22,410
I said.

448
00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:31,109
'When I walked through the stables with him,'
said Holmes, 'the ground was muddy and I saw

449
00:37:31,109 --> 00:37:35,579
the tracks of his shoes in the mud.

450
00:37:35,579 --> 00:37:39,140
You remember those tracks on the moor?

451
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:44,720
Well, these were the same shoes.

452
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:51,410
After that, it was easy, and he told me everything.

453
00:37:51,410 --> 00:37:59,940
He found Silver Blaze on the moor early in
the morning and brought him into the stables.

454
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:06,729
The horse is very well, just a different colour
at the moment.

455
00:38:06,729 --> 00:38:14,550
Brown put a very big bet on Desborough to
win the Wessex Cup, you see.

456
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:19,349
And with Silver Blaze out of the race...'

457
00:38:19,349 --> 00:38:23,260
'But why did you leave the horse there?

458
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:26,349
Is it safe with him?'

459
00:38:26,349 --> 00:38:30,329
I did not understand Holmes's plan.

460
00:38:30,329 --> 00:38:39,150
'My dear Watson,' Holmes said, 'the horse
is very safe.

461
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:49,420
Silas Brown is afraid of me, afraid of the
police, afraid of losing everything.

462
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:58,519
Silver Blaze must be ready to race next week,
or Brown's life as a racehorse trainer is

463
00:38:58,519 --> 00:39:02,979
finished - and Brown knows that.'

464
00:39:02,979 --> 00:39:09,960
'Mr Ross isn't going to like it,' I said.

465
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:17,849
'Mr Ross', said Holmes, 'doesn't understand
detective work.

466
00:39:17,849 --> 00:39:23,460
He wants answers today, now, at once.

467
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:27,829
So, he must learn a lesson.

468
00:39:27,829 --> 00:39:32,240
He must learn to wait.

469
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:39,049
Say nothing about Silver Blaze for the moment,
Watson.'

470
00:39:39,049 --> 00:39:46,150
Back at King's Pyland, we found Mr Ross and
Inspector Gregory in the trainer's house.

471
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:52,019
'An interesting visit,' said Holmes.

472
00:39:52,019 --> 00:39:59,950
'But my friend and I must go back to London
by the midnight train.'

473
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:09,440
The Inspector and Mr Ross stared at him, and
I saw that Holmes was right about Mr Ross.

474
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:18,579
'So our famous London detective can't find
poor Straker's killer,' Mr Ross said.

475
00:40:18,579 --> 00:40:21,069
'Or my horse.'

476
00:40:21,069 --> 00:40:30,180
'It's a difficult case, that's true,' said
Holmes quietly.

477
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:36,989
'But your horse is going to run in the Wessex
Cup next Tuesday.

478
00:40:36,989 --> 00:40:39,980
You have my promise on that.'

479
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:41,069
'Hm!

480
00:40:41,069 --> 00:40:46,940
A promise is a wonderful thing,' said Mr Ross.

481
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:53,190
'But I would like the horse better than a
promise.'

482
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:58,239
Holmes smiled, then turned to Inspector Gregory.

483
00:40:58,239 --> 00:41:04,330
'Inspector, can you give me a photograph of
Straker?'

484
00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:09,950
'Yes, of course,' said the Inspector.

485
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:16,950
He took one from an envelope in his pocket
and gave it to Holmes.

486
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:23,960
It was now time to go back to Tavistock, and
we went outside.

487
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:30,329
One of the stable boys was there, and Holmes
suddenly spoke to him.

488
00:41:30,329 --> 00:41:36,489
'I see you have some sheep here, next to the
stables,' he said.

489
00:41:36,489 --> 00:41:40,479
'Are they all well?'

490
00:41:40,479 --> 00:41:51,710
'They're all right, sir,' said the boy, 'but
two or three of them are a little lame.

491
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:56,579
They went lame last week.'

492
00:41:56,579 --> 00:42:00,299
Holmes was very pleased about this.

493
00:42:00,299 --> 00:42:10,440
He got into the carriage and said to the Inspector,
'Remember the lame sheep, Gregory, remember

494
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:14,119
the lame sheep!'

495
00:42:14,119 --> 00:42:21,859
Mr Ross was not interested in the sheep, but
the Inspector stared at Holmes.

496
00:42:21,859 --> 00:42:26,200
'You think the sheep are important?'

497
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:29,829
'Oh yes,' said Holmes.

498
00:42:29,829 --> 00:42:33,309
'Very important.'

499
00:42:33,309 --> 00:42:40,140
The Inspector still stared at him, very interested
now.

500
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:46,130
'And what other things are important, Mr Holmes?'

501
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:52,249
'The strange incident of the dog in the night-time.'

502
00:42:52,249 --> 00:42:59,470
'The dog did nothing in the night-time.'

503
00:42:59,470 --> 00:43:20,809
'That was the strange incident.'

504
00:43:20,809 --> 00:43:27,569
CHAPTER FIVE
A day at the races

505
00:43:27,569 --> 00:43:37,410
On Tuesday Holmes and I took the train to
Winchester, and Mr Ross met us at the station.

506
00:43:37,410 --> 00:43:43,269
He drove us to the races, but he was not a
happy man.

507
00:43:43,269 --> 00:43:47,750
'Well, Mr Holmes,' he said coldly.

508
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:52,599
'Do you have news of my horse?'

509
00:43:52,599 --> 00:43:55,170
Holmes smiled.

510
00:43:55,170 --> 00:43:59,309
'He's safe and well, I'm sure.

511
00:43:59,309 --> 00:44:03,150
How is the betting for the Wessex Cup?'

512
00:44:03,150 --> 00:44:07,799
'Very strange,' said Mr Ross.

513
00:44:07,799 --> 00:44:17,619
'Yesterday Silver Blaze was fifteen to one,
but today he's the favourite, at three to

514
00:44:17,619 --> 00:44:18,839
one.

515
00:44:18,839 --> 00:44:22,670
Why, I don't know.'

516
00:44:22,670 --> 00:44:26,519
'Ah!' said Holmes.

517
00:44:26,519 --> 00:44:32,339
'Somebody knows something!'

518
00:44:32,339 --> 00:44:39,059
We arrived only minutes before the beginning
of the Wessex Cup race.

519
00:44:39,059 --> 00:44:42,390
This was Holmes's plan, I think.

520
00:44:42,390 --> 00:44:47,539
Mr Ross had no time to ask questions.

521
00:44:47,539 --> 00:44:55,960
There were six horses running in the race,
and Silver Blaze's name was there, at number

522
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:57,630
4.

523
00:44:57,630 --> 00:45:05,190
The horses began to come out for the race,
and Mr Ross got very excited.

524
00:45:05,190 --> 00:45:07,729
'Where is he?

525
00:45:07,729 --> 00:45:10,839
I can't see him!' he cried.

526
00:45:10,839 --> 00:45:16,099
'There are two more horses to come out,' I
said.

527
00:45:16,099 --> 00:45:17,519
'And look!

528
00:45:17,519 --> 00:45:25,049
There's number 4 now, in racing colours of
red and blue.

529
00:45:25,049 --> 00:45:28,650
Those are your colours, Mr Ross.'

530
00:45:28,650 --> 00:45:37,210
And there was Silver Blaze, a big brown horse
with a white nose.

531
00:45:37,210 --> 00:45:44,170
He came past us, looking strong and well,
and ready for anything.

532
00:45:44,170 --> 00:45:50,400
'Holmes,' cried Mr Ross, 'I was wrong about
you!

533
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,779
I'm sorry.

534
00:45:52,779 --> 00:45:56,339
But why, how-?'

535
00:45:56,339 --> 00:45:59,200
'Shh!' said Holmes.

536
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:00,740
'Watch!

537
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:05,380
Yes, they're off!'

538
00:46:05,380 --> 00:46:10,910
It was a good race, fast and exciting.

539
00:46:10,910 --> 00:46:18,039
After the first minute, a horse with yellow
racing colours came to the front, and stayed

540
00:46:18,039 --> 00:46:19,150
there.

541
00:46:19,150 --> 00:46:24,529
'That's Desborough, from the Capleton stables,'
said Holmes.

542
00:46:24,529 --> 00:46:31,069
'A good horse, but Silver Blaze is better.'

543
00:46:31,069 --> 00:46:35,420
But Silver Blaze was three horses behind Desborough.

544
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:39,200
'Come on, come on!'

545
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,479
cried Mr Ross.

546
00:46:41,479 --> 00:46:43,960
'Move up now!'

547
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:47,589
We all watched the red and blue colours.

548
00:46:47,589 --> 00:46:48,900
'Yes!'

549
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:50,469
I said.

550
00:46:50,469 --> 00:46:53,770
'Look, he's moving up now!

551
00:46:53,770 --> 00:46:57,859
Watch him go!'

552
00:46:57,859 --> 00:47:09,519
Slowly but surely, Silver Blaze moved up into
fourth place, then into third place, then

553
00:47:09,519 --> 00:47:11,940
into second place.

554
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:16,369
Now only Desborough was in front of him.

555
00:47:16,369 --> 00:47:20,229
'That's my boy!' said Mr Ross.

556
00:47:20,229 --> 00:47:23,599
'Go on, go on!'

557
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:28,290
'Desborough's getting tired,' Holmes said.

558
00:47:28,290 --> 00:47:29,400
'Watch!'

559
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:33,829
Eighty metres, fifty metres...

560
00:47:33,829 --> 00:47:36,049
'He's away!'

561
00:47:36,049 --> 00:47:37,369
cried Mr Ross.

562
00:47:37,369 --> 00:47:45,549
'His nose is in front, yes, yes, he's going
to do it!'

563
00:47:45,549 --> 00:47:47,450
And he did.

564
00:47:47,450 --> 00:47:57,160
Silver Blaze kept his nose in front, finished
first, and won the Wessex Cup.

565
00:47:57,160 --> 00:48:00,859
'Wonderful!' said Mr Ross.

566
00:48:00,859 --> 00:48:01,859
'Wonderful!

567
00:48:01,859 --> 00:48:04,700
What a race!

568
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:07,599
What a horse!

569
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:10,999
Mr Holmes, how can I thank you?'

570
00:48:10,999 --> 00:48:17,579
'You must thank the horse, not me,' said Holmes,
smiling.

571
00:48:17,579 --> 00:48:23,230
'Let's go down and have a look at him.'

572
00:48:23,230 --> 00:48:28,640
Silver Blaze was still excited by his big
race.

573
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:32,780
Mr Ross looked him up and down.

574
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:36,180
'He looks well, very well.

575
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:40,489
I don't understand any of it, Mr Holmes.

576
00:48:40,489 --> 00:48:42,420
How did you do it?

577
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:46,660
Where did you find him?

578
00:48:46,660 --> 00:48:51,289
And perhaps you now have John Straker's killer
too.

579
00:48:51,289 --> 00:48:53,180
Do you?'

580
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:57,579
'Yes,' said Holmes quietly.

581
00:48:57,579 --> 00:49:02,950
'Yes, I have him too.'

582
00:49:02,950 --> 00:49:06,150
Mr Ross and I stared at him.

583
00:49:06,150 --> 00:49:08,630
'You have him?'

584
00:49:08,630 --> 00:49:10,269
Mr Ross said.

585
00:49:10,269 --> 00:49:13,709
'Where is he?'

586
00:49:13,709 --> 00:49:17,109
'He is here.'

587
00:49:17,109 --> 00:49:19,059
'Here!

588
00:49:19,059 --> 00:49:21,009
Where?'

589
00:49:21,009 --> 00:49:26,269
'Here with me now, at this moment.'

590
00:49:26,269 --> 00:49:29,059
Mr Ross's face began to go red.

591
00:49:29,059 --> 00:49:33,940
'What are you saying, Mr Holmes?' he said
angrily.

592
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:36,569
'Are you saying-?'

593
00:49:36,569 --> 00:49:38,599
Sherlock Holmes laughed.

594
00:49:38,599 --> 00:49:44,480
'No, no, Mr Ross, not you.

595
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:49,210
The killer is standing behind us.'

596
00:49:49,210 --> 00:49:55,079
He turned and put his hand on Silver Blaze's
back.

597
00:49:55,079 --> 00:49:57,800
'The horse?'

598
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:59,680
cried Mr Ross.

599
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:01,680
'The horse!'

600
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:03,459
I said.

601
00:50:03,459 --> 00:50:07,839
'Yes, the horse,' said Holmes.

602
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:10,789
'But don't be angry with him.

603
00:50:10,789 --> 00:50:16,250
You can hear all about the mystery, but later,
please.

604
00:50:16,250 --> 00:50:41,109
I have a little bet on a horse in the next
race, and I would like to see it win...'

605
00:50:41,109 --> 00:50:48,380
CHAPTER SIX
Holmes has the answers

606
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:56,280
On the train back to London Holmes told us
the story behind the mystery, and the time

607
00:50:56,280 --> 00:51:00,529
went very quickly.

608
00:51:00,529 --> 00:51:10,950
'Before we went down to King's Pyland,' my
friend began, 'I thought it was Fitzroy Simpson.

609
00:51:10,950 --> 00:51:19,609
But when we arrived at the stables, I suddenly
remembered the hot meat curry.

610
00:51:19,609 --> 00:51:23,400
Why didn't I think of it before?

611
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:27,890
That, you see, was the beginning.'

612
00:51:27,890 --> 00:51:34,640
'The meat curry...' said Mr Ross, thinking
about it.

613
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:38,880
'Er, how did the meat curry help you?'

614
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:44,910
'Do you know the taste of opium?'

615
00:51:44,910 --> 00:51:46,619
Holmes said.

616
00:51:46,619 --> 00:51:48,170
'No?

617
00:51:48,170 --> 00:51:55,309
Well, it's not a very strong taste, but it's
there.

618
00:51:55,309 --> 00:52:02,020
You can taste it in most food, but not in
curry.

619
00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:08,220
Curry has a very strong taste, stronger than
opium.

620
00:52:08,220 --> 00:52:16,829
So the killer says, "I need a night when the
dinner is a meat curry.

621
00:52:16,829 --> 00:52:27,140
Then Ned Hunter can eat his dinner happily,
without the taste of opium - and go to sleep."

622
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:34,309
But did Fitzroy Simpson know that curry was
the dinner on Monday night?

623
00:52:34,309 --> 00:52:36,549
Of course not.

624
00:52:36,549 --> 00:52:38,759
How could he?

625
00:52:38,759 --> 00:52:46,160
He didn't make the dinner, he was a stranger
at King's Pyland, he knew nobody in the trainer's

626
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:47,780
house.

627
00:52:47,780 --> 00:52:54,089
So, we forget Simpson, and think again.

628
00:52:54,089 --> 00:53:01,319
Who knew about the curry before dinner on
that Monday night?'

629
00:53:01,319 --> 00:53:06,890
'John Straker and his wife,' I said.

630
00:53:06,890 --> 00:53:07,900
'And the servant.'

631
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:11,849
'Right, Watson.

632
00:53:11,849 --> 00:53:18,459
And so on to the next question, about the
dog.

633
00:53:18,459 --> 00:53:25,700
We know there was a dog in the stables that
night because Ned Hunter took the dog out

634
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:28,559
when Simpson was there.

635
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:37,969
Then in the middle of the night someone went
into the stables and took out a horse.

636
00:53:37,969 --> 00:53:47,499
The two boys sleeping upstairs in the stables
heard nothing, because there was nothing to

637
00:53:47,499 --> 00:53:49,160
hear.

638
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:53,640
The dog did not bark.

639
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:55,650
Why not?'

640
00:53:55,650 --> 00:53:59,119
'Aha!' said Mr Ross.

641
00:53:59,119 --> 00:54:04,980
'It didn't bark, because it knew the visitor.

642
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:07,420
Dogs only bark at strangers.'

643
00:54:07,420 --> 00:54:10,599
'Right again.

644
00:54:10,599 --> 00:54:16,069
So, the midnight visitor was John Straker.

645
00:54:16,069 --> 00:54:20,500
But why did he take the horse out?

646
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:22,760
What did he want?

647
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:31,249
It was something dishonest, or why did he
put opium in his stable boy's dinner?

648
00:54:31,249 --> 00:54:35,269
We all know about dishonest trainers.

649
00:54:35,269 --> 00:54:43,729
They can make a lot of money - they put big
bets against their own horse, and then stop

650
00:54:43,729 --> 00:54:46,829
their horse winning.

651
00:54:46,829 --> 00:54:48,039
But how?

652
00:54:48,039 --> 00:54:52,839
What was Straker's plan here?

653
00:54:52,839 --> 00:54:58,550
Perhaps the answer was in his pockets, I thought.

654
00:54:58,550 --> 00:55:01,549
'And so it was.

655
00:55:01,549 --> 00:55:05,220
You remember the strange knife?

656
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:14,829
Dr Watson here told us about it - an eye knife,
used by doctors in hospitals.

657
00:55:14,829 --> 00:55:23,220
With a knife like this, you can make a cut
- a very, very small cut - in the tendon of

658
00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:27,069
a horse's back leg.

659
00:55:27,069 --> 00:55:32,720
Nobody can see the cut, and the horse only
feels it a little.

660
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:40,650
He's not lame, but he doesn't run his best,
so he cannot win the race.'

661
00:55:40,650 --> 00:55:46,499
'And Straker wanted to do this to my horse?'

662
00:55:46,499 --> 00:55:47,969
cried Mr Ross.

663
00:55:47,969 --> 00:55:49,959
'How could he?

664
00:55:49,959 --> 00:55:53,299
I thought he was a good man!'

665
00:55:53,299 --> 00:55:55,829
'No,' said Holmes.

666
00:55:55,829 --> 00:56:01,099
'He wasn't a good man - or a careful one.

667
00:56:01,099 --> 00:56:08,510
No horse stands quietly when a knife goes
into its back leg.

668
00:56:08,510 --> 00:56:16,450
Straker didn't want anyone to hear the noise,
so he took the horse out onto the moor.'

669
00:56:16,450 --> 00:56:22,579
'The candle, and the match,' I said.

670
00:56:22,579 --> 00:56:24,359
'Of course!'

671
00:56:24,359 --> 00:56:27,079
'That's right,' Holmes said.

672
00:56:27,079 --> 00:56:31,099
'And I learnt more from Straker's pockets
too.

673
00:56:31,099 --> 00:56:35,569
You are a man of the world, Mr Ross.

674
00:56:35,569 --> 00:56:41,709
Do men carry other men's bills around in their
pockets?

675
00:56:41,709 --> 00:56:46,200
No, they do not.

676
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:50,479
So who was Mr Darbyshire?

677
00:56:50,479 --> 00:56:54,630
Another name for John Straker.

678
00:56:54,630 --> 00:56:57,339
And there was a lady in the case, too.

679
00:56:57,339 --> 00:57:01,359
A very expensive lady.

680
00:57:01,359 --> 00:57:09,839
I talked to Mrs Straker about the dress and
the hat on the bill, but she knew nothing

681
00:57:09,839 --> 00:57:12,089
about them.'

682
00:57:12,089 --> 00:57:22,790
'And on Monday night, out on the moor,' said
Mr Ross, 'what happened, do you think?'

683
00:57:22,790 --> 00:57:27,579
'How about this?' said Holmes.

684
00:57:27,579 --> 00:57:31,460
'Straker takes the horse down the hill.

685
00:57:31,460 --> 00:57:40,759
He sees Simpson's scarf on the ground, and
takes it with him - why, I don't know.

686
00:57:40,759 --> 00:57:49,329
He puts his coat on a tree, gets out the candle
and the matches, and the knife, and begins

687
00:57:49,329 --> 00:57:51,509
his work.

688
00:57:51,509 --> 00:57:55,039
But Silver Blaze doesn't like it.

689
00:57:55,039 --> 00:58:01,380
Perhaps he's afraid, perhaps he feels something
is wrong.

690
00:58:01,380 --> 00:58:06,309
He's a big strong horse, and he gets angry.

691
00:58:06,309 --> 00:58:13,959
He kicks out with his back legs, and the horseshoes
hit Straker on the head.

692
00:58:13,959 --> 00:58:22,609
Straker goes down, into the mud, and the knife
in his hand goes into his own leg.

693
00:58:22,609 --> 00:58:27,400
The horse disappears into the night.'

694
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:28,960
'Wonderful!'

695
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:30,089
Mr Ross said.

696
00:58:30,089 --> 00:58:33,579
'You tell it very well, Mr Holmes.

697
00:58:33,579 --> 00:58:36,339
I see it all now.'

698
00:58:36,339 --> 00:58:37,970
'And the sheep?'

699
00:58:37,970 --> 00:58:39,529
I asked.

700
00:58:39,529 --> 00:58:42,529
'What about the sheep?

701
00:58:42,529 --> 00:58:46,180
You told Inspector Gregory that they were
important.'

702
00:58:46,180 --> 00:58:51,950
'Ah yes, Watson, the sheep.'

703
00:58:51,950 --> 00:58:53,160
Holmes smiled.

704
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:57,380
'And they were important.

705
00:58:57,380 --> 00:59:05,289
It's not easy to make a very small cut in
an animal's tendon, and Straker did not want

706
00:59:05,289 --> 00:59:07,670
to get it wrong.

707
00:59:07,670 --> 00:59:13,519
He needed to practise first, but what on?

708
00:59:13,519 --> 00:59:18,190
There were his own sheep, right in front of
him.'

709
00:59:18,190 --> 00:59:24,989
'And where did you go in London, the day after
we got back?'

710
00:59:24,989 --> 00:59:26,079
I asked.

711
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:31,749
'Was it to that dress-maker on the bill for
Mr Darbyshire?'

712
00:59:31,749 --> 00:59:35,140
'Very good, Watson!'

713
00:59:35,140 --> 00:59:36,619
Holmes laughed.

714
00:59:36,619 --> 00:59:44,019
'Yes, I had a photograph of Straker, and the
dress-maker knew him at once.

715
00:59:44,019 --> 00:59:49,150
"Oh yes," she said, "that's Mr Darbyshire.

716
00:59:49,150 --> 00:59:52,490
I do a lot of work for him.

717
00:59:52,490 --> 00:59:59,779
Mrs Darbyshire is a very beautiful lady, and
she likes expensive dresses."'

718
00:59:59,779 --> 01:00:02,390
Holmes laughed again.

719
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:06,180
'It's an old, old story.

720
01:00:06,180 --> 01:00:12,069
Straker is not the first man with two women
in his life.

721
01:00:12,069 --> 01:00:19,609
He needed more money for the expensive Mrs
Darbyshire, so he thought of this plan with

722
01:00:19,609 --> 01:00:22,440
Silver Blaze.

723
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:25,829
And there you have it, Mr Ross.'

724
01:00:25,829 --> 01:00:36,199
'Yes, I understand it all now,' said Mr Ross,
'and thank you very much, Mr Holmes.

725
01:00:36,199 --> 01:00:39,469
There's just one thing.

726
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:42,839
Where was the horse?'

727
01:00:42,839 --> 01:00:45,900
'Ah, yes.

728
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:57,680
The horse was safe and well, and with a friend,'
said Sherlock Holmes, I can't tell you who

729
01:00:57,680 --> 01:01:02,499
or where, because I made a promise.

730
01:01:02,499 --> 01:01:07,359
But here we are, nearly in London.

731
01:01:07,359 --> 01:01:15,230
You have the answer to the mystery, Mr Ross,
you are the winner of the Wessex Cup, and

732
01:01:15,230 --> 01:01:21,369
the owner of the fastest racehorse in the
south of England.

733
01:01:21,369 --> 01:01:28,219
What more do you need?'

734
01:01:28,219 --> 01:01:40,660
- THE END -
