John 'Jack' Sheppard - Housebreaker and escape
artist

CHAPTER ONE

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:13,719
A Life of Crime

5
00:00:13,719 --> 00:00:19,440
John Sheppard was a thief and highwayman,
but he became a very popular figure in his

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:23,869
lifetime because of his extraordinary courage.

7
00:00:23,869 --> 00:00:29,710
At least two plays were written about him,
and society was fascinated by his life and

8
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:32,029
adventures.

9
00:00:32,029 --> 00:00:38,640
John Sheppard's father was a carpenter in
a poor part of London called Spitalfields.

10
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:45,040
He had two sons, John, who was born in 1702,
and Thomas.

11
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,710
John was always known as Jack.

12
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:54,670
The two brothers both became famous robbers.

13
00:00:54,670 --> 00:01:00,120
Jack was the first of the two brothers to
begin a life of crime.

14
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:05,610
He worked for a carpenter in London, but he
soon began to spend a lot of time at the Black

15
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:08,780
Lion pub in Drury Lane.

16
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:14,909
It was here that he met a woman called Elizabeth
Lyon, but more commonly known among her friends

17
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:18,010
as Edgeworth Bess.

18
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:22,090
Jack fell under her influence and they formed
a partnership.

19
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:26,220
'I can make you rich,' she told him.

20
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,550
'How?' he asked her.

21
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:30,170
'Listen,' she said.

22
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:32,600
'You're a carpenter.

23
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,940
You work in rich people's houses.

24
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:41,740
That gives you the perfect opportunity to
steal valuable objects.'

25
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:48,220
At first Jack was very successful and no one
suspected him of the robberies that were taking

26
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:51,220
place in the houses where he worked.

27
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:57,969
He stole valuable items for Edgeworth Bess
and she sold them for him.

28
00:01:57,969 --> 00:02:04,740
Jack also had another woman friend named Maggot,
and she persuaded him to rob a local merchant,

29
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:09,819
Mr Bains, who was a trader in valuable cloth.

30
00:02:09,819 --> 00:02:15,300
First Jack went to Mr Bains' house and bought
some cloth in order to see what the house

31
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,500
was like inside.

32
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,930
He went home and put the piece of cloth in
his trunk.

33
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:25,690
The same night he returned secretly to the
house.

34
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:33,050
He broke in and stole money and other property,
which he then took to Maggot.

35
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:38,900
Jack did not go back to his master's home
that night, or the next, and his master began

36
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:43,090
to be suspicious of the young man's activities.

37
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:47,380
He decided to open Jack's trunk to see what
was inside.

38
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:53,860
He found the piece of cloth that Jack had
bought from Mr Bains.

39
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:59,510
When Jack finally returned home, he realised
that his master now had evidence that connected

40
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:01,680
him with Mr Bains.

41
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:08,550
So Jack stole the piece of cloth back from
his employer and hid it.

42
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:13,760
When Jack's master heard about the robbery
at Mr Bains' house, he was sure that Jack

43
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,720
was involved.

44
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:22,300
He contacted Mr Bains and described the piece
of cloth that he had seen in Jack's trunk.

45
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:27,690
Mr Bains knew immediately that Jack was the
young man who had bought the cloth, and he

46
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:34,409
too guessed that the purchase of the cloth
was a trick to enter his house.

47
00:03:34,409 --> 00:03:38,959
When Jack heard that he was suspected, he
pretended to get very angry.

48
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,129
'I haven't stolen anything,' he shouted.

49
00:03:42,129 --> 00:03:44,810
'My mother gave me that piece of cloth!'

50
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:46,570
'Did she?'

51
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:47,690
Mr Bains said.

52
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:49,840
'And where did she get it from?'

53
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,580
'Ask her yourself,' Jack said.

54
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:57,960
'I think I will,' his master replied.

55
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:01,860
Jack's master sent for the boy's mother and
asked her about the cloth.

56
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:06,330
'My son's telling the truth,' she said.

57
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:10,760
'I bought the cloth at a market in Spitalfields.'

58
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,989
'Where exactly in the market did you buy it?'

59
00:04:13,989 --> 00:04:15,349
the master asked.

60
00:04:15,349 --> 00:04:20,380
'I don't remember,' Jack's mother said.

61
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:26,070
Jack's master and Mr Bains did not believe
what Jack and his mother told them, but they

62
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:30,380
had no direct evidence against Jack for the
robbery.

63
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:35,610
Despite his suspicions of him, Jack's master
decided to let the boy continue to work for

64
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:39,160
him as an apprentice.

65
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:45,230
Jack became more and more involved in crime,
and he finally became part of a gang led by

66
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:49,640
Jonathan Wild, another famous criminal.

67
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:54,680
He now worked for himself as a carpenter and
this meant that he continued to have easy

68
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:58,050
entrance to rich people's houses.

69
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:03,680
In one case he was repairing a house belonging
to an elderly gentleman in a rich area of

70
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,960
London.

71
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:10,480
He robbed the gentleman of money, jewellery
and expensive clothes.

72
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:17,910
Shortly after this robbery Edgeworth Bess
was arrested and sent to a local prison.

73
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:22,250
Jack went to the prison and demanded to see
his friend.

74
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:27,900
When the prison officer refused him permission,
Jack attacked him and went in.

75
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,820
'You're coming with me,' he told Edgeworth
Bess.

76
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,430
'What do you mean?'

77
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:33,610
she asked him.

78
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:35,039
'I'm a prisoner here.

79
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,770
I can't come with you!'

80
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:39,590
'Yes, you can!'

81
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:41,130
Jack told her with a laugh.

82
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:45,840
'I knocked the officer out - he won't give
us any trouble now!'

83
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,310
He picked up Bess and carried her out of the
prison.

84
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:54,990
This episode made him very popular with the
criminal world in London, especially with

85
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:56,530
the women.

86
00:05:56,530 --> 00:06:02,449
The brothers, Tom and Jack, worked together,
robbing houses and selling the items that

87
00:06:02,449 --> 00:06:04,139
they had stolen.

88
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:07,889
They also continued to work with Edgeworth
Bess.

89
00:06:07,889 --> 00:06:14,490
They broke into the house of a merchant, Mrs
Cook, and stole some valuable items.

90
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:19,630
Tom tried to sell them but he was arrested
and taken to Newgate prison, where some of

91
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:23,350
London's most notorious criminals were kept.

92
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:28,729
He offered to give evidence against his brother
Jack and Edgeworth Bess in order to receive

93
00:06:28,729 --> 00:06:31,110
a lighter punishment.

94
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:35,800
The authorities looked everywhere for Jack
and Edgeworth Bess, but they could not find

95
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,600
them.

96
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:42,131
One day Jack met a friend of his in the street,
a man called James Sykes.

97
00:06:42,131 --> 00:06:48,790
Sykes knew that the authorities were looking
for Jack, and he made a plan.

98
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:52,660
He hoped to get a lot of money for capturing
Jack.

99
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:56,949
He took Jack into a pub and bought him a lot
of beer.

100
00:06:56,949 --> 00:07:01,669
While Jack was happily drinking, Sykes sent
for a constable.

101
00:07:01,669 --> 00:07:06,319
The constable arrested Jack and took him to
prison.

102
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,910
Jack waited until the middle of the night
and then made a hole in the roof of the prison

103
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:13,550
and escaped.

104
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:15,919
Jack's freedom did not last long.

105
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:21,979
He was soon arrested again, and this time
he and Edgeworth Bess were taken to another

106
00:07:21,979 --> 00:07:23,210
prison.

107
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:28,160
The authorities thought that Jack and Bess
were husband and wife, and they allowed them

108
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:33,720
to live together in a room in the prison called
Newgate Ward.

109
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:40,660
A few days after their arrival at the prison,
Jack managed to cut off his iron chains.

110
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:46,680
He then made a hole in the prison wall, and
removed one of the iron bars from the window.

111
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:51,729
He looked down and saw that it was too far
to jump to the ground.

112
00:07:51,729 --> 00:07:57,669
So he tied some sheets together, and tied
one end around a bar in the window.

113
00:07:57,669 --> 00:08:04,100
Then he helped Edgeworth Bess to climb down
to the ground, and he quickly followed her.

114
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:10,000
They were now in front of a high prison wall,
but they managed to climb over it and escape

115
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,800
into the city.

116
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:18,270
The criminal class of London enjoyed hearing
about Jack's adventures and he became a hero

117
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:19,680
to them.

118
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:26,490
One criminal, Charles Grace, asked if he could
work with Jack, and Jack agreed.

119
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:31,020
Charles and Jack made friends with a young
man called Anthony Lamb, who worked for a

120
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:33,990
maker of mathematical instruments.

121
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:39,720
They planned to rob a wealthy gentleman who
lived in the instrument maker's house.

122
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:45,540
Late one night Lamb opened the door of the
house and let Jack and Charles in and they

123
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:48,580
stole a lot of money.

124
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:54,110
When the robbery was discovered the next morning,
Anthony Lamb was very frightened.

125
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:57,410
His master sent for him and asked what had
happened.

126
00:08:57,410 --> 00:09:01,620
'I don't know, sir,' Lamb replied.

127
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:04,209
His master looked at him suspiciously.

128
00:09:04,209 --> 00:09:08,130
He saw that the young man's hands were shaking.

129
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:11,200
'I don't believe you,' he said angrily.

130
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:16,680
'I think you stole the money, and you'll be
hanged for it!'

131
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:20,870
In the end Lamb confessed his involvement
in the crime.

132
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:26,260
He was sent to Newgate prison, tried, and
then transported.

133
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:32,860
Thomas Sheppard was also tried for the robbery
of Mrs Cook and he was transported as well.

134
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:39,500
Jack Sheppard then started working with another
famous criminal, a man called Blueskin.

135
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:44,890
They sometimes sold the items that they had
stolen to a man called William Field.

136
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:50,649
Meanwhile, they hired a stable in which they
kept what they had stolen before selling it.

137
00:09:50,649 --> 00:09:55,920
Among the other stolen items in the stable
was a length of cloth that had been taken

138
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,500
from a certain Mr Kneebone.

139
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:05,600
It was stealing this piece of cloth that led
to Jack's next arrest.

140
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:12,060
One day Jack and Blueskin asked William Field
to go to their stable and look at the items

141
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:16,200
they had, so that he could find buyers for
them.

142
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:22,480
Field, who was a coward but an imaginative
criminal, did more than that.

143
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:27,070
He broke into the stable and stole everything.

144
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:32,450
Then he went to Jonathan Wild, knowing his
influence in the criminal world, and told

145
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:37,100
him that Jack was working with Blueskin.

146
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:42,130
Jack and Blueskin were arrested soon after
and sent to Newgate prison, where they were

147
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:48,410
tried for their robberies, and Jack was sentenced
to death for the theft of the cloth belonging

148
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:54,200
to Mr Kneebone.

149
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,750
CHAPTER TWO

150
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:56,890
Great Escapes

151
00:10:56,890 --> 00:11:08,870
An order for the execution of Jack Sheppard
arrived at Newgate prison on Monday 30 August

152
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:10,390
1724.

153
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:15,360
Once again Jack showed his extraordinary courage.

154
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,910
There was a place in the prison where friends
could come to talk to the prisoners.

155
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:27,150
The visitors and the prisoners were separated
by a hole in the wall that had bars in it.

156
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:30,130
Jack loosened one of the bars.

157
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:35,150
When some women friends came to visit him,
he broke the bar off the wall completely and

158
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:37,800
the women pulled him through the hole.

159
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:41,930
He was a free man once again.

160
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:47,630
Jack went to see a friend of his called Page,
and they went into the country for a week.

161
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:51,950
On their return to London they passed a watchmaker's
shop.

162
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:56,529
They were surprised to see that the shop was
open, but that there was only a boy guarding

163
00:11:56,529 --> 00:11:57,870
it.

164
00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:04,730
Jack immediately broke the shop window and
pulled out some valuable watches.

165
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:09,769
Jack's friends now knew that he was back in
London, and they warned him that the authorities

166
00:12:09,769 --> 00:12:12,900
were looking everywhere for him.

167
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:18,720
They eventually found where he was hiding
and took him back to Newgate prison.

168
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:23,260
This time they were determined to stop him
escaping.

169
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:28,170
'You've been very lucky in the past,' one
of the officers told him, 'but you're not

170
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:30,740
going to escape from us again.

171
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:34,060
We'll make sure it's impossible!'

172
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:39,610
They put iron chains on his legs and handcuffs
on his wrists.

173
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:45,560
The chains on his legs were attached to a
ring in the floor of his prison cell.

174
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:51,630
His adventures had by now made Jack famous
with all social classes, and many important

175
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:54,180
people came to visit him.

176
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:56,519
Some of his visitors gave him money.

177
00:12:56,519 --> 00:13:01,510
'Who knows if he'll try to escape again,'
they thought.

178
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:06,579
Sheppard found a nail in the room, which he
used to open the lock that attached his chain

179
00:13:06,579 --> 00:13:08,899
to the ring in the floor.

180
00:13:08,899 --> 00:13:12,910
Then he used the same nail to open his handcuffs.

181
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:18,339
He could not remove the chains, but he pulled
them as high up his legs as he could.

182
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:24,779
His next move was to climb the chimney in
the room, but his way was blocked by an iron

183
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:26,480
bar.

184
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,450
He then worked with his hands to free the
iron bar.

185
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:35,089
He climbed back up the chimney and made his
way into the room above.

186
00:13:35,089 --> 00:13:40,649
No one had used this room for many years and
the door was locked, but it did not take Sheppard

187
00:13:40,649 --> 00:13:43,040
long to break it.

188
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:48,110
He then went into the prison chapel and climbed
onto the roof of the prison.

189
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:53,300
He looked down, and saw that the nearest building
was a long way below him.

190
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:57,490
If he jumped, it would be very dangerous.

191
00:13:57,490 --> 00:14:02,300
He went back to his original cell and took
the blanket from the bed.

192
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,680
Then he went back onto the roof.

193
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:09,029
He tied one end of the blanket to the roof
of the prison, and then climbed down to the

194
00:14:09,029 --> 00:14:11,440
neighbouring house.

195
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:16,370
It was midnight by now, and Sheppard was exhausted
after his escape.

196
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:22,139
He walked to the edge of the city and found
a stable where he slept for some hours.

197
00:14:22,139 --> 00:14:26,290
It was raining when he woke up and he was
cold and hungry.

198
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:31,940
He bought some food from a little shop nearby
and returned to the stable.

199
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:36,460
Next he tried to remove the chains from his
legs by hitting them with a stone.

200
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:40,519
Two long, miserable days passed.

201
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:46,130
Finally, a shoemaker passed by the stable
and Sheppard asked him to help remove the

202
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:50,970
chains, offering to pay the man twenty shillings.

203
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:58,769
The shoemaker agreed, and by five o'clock
that afternoon Sheppard was able to walk freely.

204
00:14:58,769 --> 00:15:04,310
He tore his clothes to make himself look like
a beggar and walked back to London.

205
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:08,949
He stayed in a poor tavern in the city and
talked to the landlady about the adventures

206
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:10,100
of Jack Sheppard.

207
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:14,220
'I hope he escapes again,' the woman said.

208
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:16,430
'He's a brave young man!'

209
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:18,780
'So do I,' Jack replied.

210
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:21,710
'He might do it, too!'

211
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:26,860
Jack then walked around the streets, where
he heard two ballad singers singing about

212
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:29,579
his adventures.

213
00:15:29,579 --> 00:15:35,850
A few nights later he broke into a shop in
Drury Lane and stole some fine clothes, a

214
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:39,560
sword, rings, watches and other items.

215
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:45,380
He put on the stolen clothes and went to find
his old friends.

216
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:50,019
He ate in taverns with his friends, and he
even visited his mother to tell her that he

217
00:15:50,019 --> 00:15:52,250
was free once more.

218
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:56,760
He celebrated his new freedom by drinking
a lot of wine and brandy.

219
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:02,690
At midnight, the boy who worked in the tavern
where Jack Sheppard was entertaining his friends

220
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:05,200
recognised who he was.

221
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:11,880
The boy called the authorities and they arrested
Sheppard and took him back to Newgate.

222
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:17,220
Up until the end Jack Sheppard hoped to escape
his death at Tyburn.

223
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:22,170
He hid a sharp knife in his pocket on the
journey to the place of execution, but an

224
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:25,699
officer discovered it and took it away from
him.

225
00:16:25,699 --> 00:16:27,990
He had another plan for survival.

226
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:34,029
'After they hang me,' he told his friends,
'you must put me into a warm bed and open

227
00:16:34,029 --> 00:16:35,940
a vein in my arm.

228
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:39,850
I'm sure this will help me recover from the
hanging.'

229
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:46,779
He behaved with courage and dignity at the
execution, and confessed his crimes.

230
00:16:46,779 --> 00:16:53,170
He was executed on 21 November 1724.

231
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:56,440
PART TWO

232
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:01,250
John Gow-Captain of famous gang of pirates

233
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:03,250
CHAPTER ONE

234
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:07,089
The Life of a Pirate

235
00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:13,870
John Gow, the man who became known as the
'Orkney Pirate', was born in 1698 and grew

236
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:20,500
up in the North of Scotland, on one of the
Orkney Islands, where he became a sailor.

237
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:25,770
He was very good at his profession and soon
became third-in-command of a ship sailing

238
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:27,910
for Santa Cruz.

239
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:32,880
The crew of the ship were very unhappy with
their conditions on board, and complained

240
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,650
particularly about the food.

241
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:40,830
The captain did not take their complaints
seriously at first, but he soon changed his

242
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:41,830
mind.

243
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:46,820
He realised that the crew were preparing to
take over control of the ship, and called

244
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,000
the chief mate.

245
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,440
'I think we may have some trouble with the
men,' the captain explained.

246
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:56,110
'I want you to put some pistols in the cabin.'

247
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:59,890
'Yes, sir,' the chief mate replied.

248
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:05,830
Two members of the crew heard the conversation
and they told John Gow about the captain s

249
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:06,830
preparations.

250
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:11,940
Gow, who had always wanted to become a pirate,
thought about what to do.

251
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:17,289
'If you take control of the ship, I'll help
you,' Gow told the men.

252
00:18:17,289 --> 00:18:19,669
But I want to be the new captain!'

253
00:18:19,669 --> 00:18:22,120
Gow was excited.

254
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:27,840
It looked as if his secret desire to be a
pirate was really going to happen!

255
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:33,190
That night a group of rebel sailors attacked
the senior officers of the ship, murdering

256
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:36,670
the doctor, the chief mate and then the captain.

257
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:41,840
They elected John Gow the new captain of the
ship.

258
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:48,000
Not all of the crew had been involved in the
mutiny, and the innocent men were now hiding,

259
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,240
frightened that they might be killed too.

260
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:56,530
'Nothing will happen to you if you continue
to obey orders as you did before the mutiny,

261
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:59,180
but now I'll give the orders!'

262
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:01,010
John Gow told the men.

263
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:03,570
The sailors agreed.

264
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:09,970
The rebels decided to change the name of the
ship from the George Galley to the Revenge.

265
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:15,120
They left for Spain and Portugal, where they
hoped to steal a large quantity of wine.

266
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:21,130
During the journey they discovered a British
fishing ship, which they decided to attack

267
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:22,370
and capture.

268
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:27,770
They sailed very close to the ship and Gow
shouted his commands to the other captain.

269
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:32,679
'We're pirates and we're going to capture
your ship,' he shouted.

270
00:19:32,679 --> 00:19:34,710
'It's useless to resist us.

271
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:37,490
If you try, we'll kill all of you!'

272
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:41,730
'We won't fight,' the other captain shouted
back.

273
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:44,669
'Come and take what you want.'

274
00:19:44,669 --> 00:19:49,890
They had no use for the cargo or the ship,
so they sank the ship and kept its captain

275
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:52,560
and four of his men on the Revenge.

276
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:56,480
They then attacked a Scottish fishing ship.

277
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:01,670
Once again they sank the ship and took the
men onto the Revenge.

278
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:07,520
By now they did not have much drinking water,
so they decided to go to the Portuguese island

279
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,650
of Madeira.

280
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:14,830
They anchored some distance away from the
harbour and made a plan.

281
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:17,990
Seven men left for the harbour in a small
boat.

282
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:23,789
Their instructions were to capture a ship
and bring it out of the harbour.

283
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:29,909
If they could not do this, they had to steal
wine and water and bring it back to the Revenge.

284
00:20:29,909 --> 00:20:36,020
This attempt failed, however, and they decided
to leave Madeira.

285
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:42,620
They sailed about ten miles along the coast
until they reached a small town, Port Santa.

286
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:47,820
Gow sent some men to the town with a present
of fish for the governor.

287
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:52,820
The governor treated them very politely and
visited the Revenge as a guest.

288
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:58,340
Gow and the rebels entertained the governor
and his friends very well at first.

289
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:03,710
Later, however, when the boat they had sent
to the island for food and drink came back

290
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:07,250
without any, Gow threatened the governor and
his friends.

291
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:11,140
'We want food and wine,' he told the governor
and his friends.

292
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:15,640
'If you don't get it for us immediately, we'll
kill you!'

293
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,690
The governor was very surprised and frightened.

294
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:23,090
'I'll make sure you get food and wine,' he
said.

295
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:26,010
'There's no need to kill anyone.'

296
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:32,480
The pirates then left for the coast of Spain,
where they found a British ship carrying slaves.

297
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:37,040
They captured the ship and put on board all
the men they had taken from other captured

298
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,040
ships.

299
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:42,270
Then they took all the food and drink from
the ship and allowed it to continue on its

300
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:43,450
way.

301
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:49,820
They next captured a French ship, which had
a cargo of wine, oil and fruit.

302
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:54,550
The pirates stole the goods and gave this
ship to the Scottish captain whose fishing

303
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:59,220
ship they had sunk, and he took his men on
board with him.

304
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:02,070
Gow was delighted with his crew.

305
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:04,470
'Well done, men!' he cried.

306
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:08,490
'If we go on like this, we'll all be rich
men!'

307
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:15,740
The pirates cheered their captain.

308
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:18,630
Soon they saw another French ship approaching.

309
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:24,400
It was a large ship and had thirty-two guns,
so Gow called his crew together to discuss

310
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,240
tactics.

311
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:31,250
He told them it was too dangerous to risk
attacking a ship with so many guns.

312
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:36,549
All the crew agreed with him except lieutenant
Williams, who was a violent, dangerous man.

313
00:22:36,549 --> 00:22:42,230
'You're not brave enough to be in command
of a pirate ship,' Williams told him.

314
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:48,120
'We should attack this ship, capture it, and
throw all its men into the sea!'

315
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:51,140
Gow looked angrily at the lieutenant.

316
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:55,630
'I say that it's too dangerous to attack that
ship,' he replied.

317
00:22:55,630 --> 00:23:01,570
'And I won't throw prisoners into the sea
- there's been too much violence already.'

318
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:07,180
Williams took out his pistol and pointed it
at Gow, but it did not fire.

319
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:12,340
Two pirates immediately shot Williams, injuring
him seriously.

320
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:17,760
Williams jumped into the hold and threatened
to blow the ship up, but some of the pirates

321
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,919
fought him and tied him up, then put him with
the French prisoners.

322
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:25,340
Their next capture was another British ship.

323
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:30,560
Again they stole all the food and drink from
the ship and then put their prisoners on board

324
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:33,020
the captured ship.

325
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:37,950
They also put Williams on board, and instructed
the captain of the ship to hand Williams over

326
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:40,620
to the British authorities.

327
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:45,159
Williams knew that if he was taken back to
England, he would be executed.

328
00:23:45,159 --> 00:23:51,750
'Don't send me back to England,' he asked
Gow very humbly, 'you know what will happen

329
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:53,630
to me there.

330
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:58,120
Throw me into the sea if you like, but don't
send me back to England!'

331
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:05,640
Gow did not say a word to Williams but some
of the pirates began to laugh cruelly at him.

332
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:11,010
'They'll hang you,' they told him.

333
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:19,799
'Have a good voyage to the gallows.'

334
00:24:19,799 --> 00:24:21,299
CHAPTER TWO

335
00:24:21,299 --> 00:24:22,299
Captured

336
00:24:22,299 --> 00:24:28,370
The pirates' next problem was where to go.

337
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:32,960
'North America, that's the place for us,'
some of them suggested.

338
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:37,540
'We'll be safe there, and we can find all
the things we want.'

339
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:40,970
Gow, however, was against this.

340
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:42,789
He wanted to go back home.

341
00:24:42,789 --> 00:24:46,770
'We'll go to the Orkney Islands,' he told
the crew.

342
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:52,290
'I know the place well, and we can easily
sell what we've captured and live comfortably

343
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:53,850
off the profits.

344
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:58,600
Anyway,' he continued, 'we need to repair
the ship as well.

345
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:02,789
We can only do that in a northern port.

346
00:25:02,789 --> 00:25:08,580
Eventually the crew accepted his decision,
and the ship sailed for the Orkney Islands.

347
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:13,430
When they arrived at one of the islands, Gow
told his crew how to behave when they went

348
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:14,430
ashore.

349
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:20,960
'You must say that we were sailing from Cadiz
to Stockholm but that bad winds drove the

350
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,970
ship too far north.

351
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:28,860
You must also tell the local people that you
want to repair the ship, and that if they

352
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:32,590
help you, you'll pay them very well.'

353
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:38,290
But Gow's luck began to go against him; the
sailors on board the ship who had not wanted

354
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:42,220
to join the mutiny saw their opportunity.

355
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:47,470
When one of the ship's boats went to the island,
a sailor escaped from the pirates and went

356
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:49,390
in search of the local sheriff.

357
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:53,590
'The Revenge is really a pirate ship,' he
explained.

358
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:58,500
'I had to stay on board because they threatened
to kill me.'

359
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:02,930
'You did the right thing to come here and
tell me,' the sheriff replied.

360
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:09,360
Then the sheriff ordered his men to make preparations
to capture the ship.

361
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:13,460
Another ten sailors who had been forced to
join the mutiny stole the ship's boat and

362
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:15,860
sailed to the mainland of Scotland.

363
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:21,440
They were arrested when they arrived in Edinburgh
and put in prison because the authorities

364
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,309
thought they were pirates.

365
00:26:24,309 --> 00:26:29,590
Despite the loss of these members of his crew,
Gow did not move the ship.

366
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:36,320
He decided to stay in the bay and to rob the
gentlemen and ladies who lived on the island.

367
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:41,460
When they had finished, they sailed to a neighbouring
island called Calf Sound.

368
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:47,679
Gow wanted to rob the house of a gentleman
who lived there, a man called Fea, who Gow

369
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:49,360
had been at school with.

370
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:54,990
Gow brought the Revenge too close to the rocks
when he anchored the ship, and he sent a letter

371
00:26:54,990 --> 00:27:00,100
to Mr Fea asking for a boat so that he could
pull his ship away from the rocks.

372
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:06,260
Mr Fea was suspicious of the sailors, because
he knew they had robbed a lady on one of the

373
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:08,010
small islands nearby.

374
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:14,529
He ordered his servants to sink his own boat
so that Gow and his men could not use it.

375
00:27:14,529 --> 00:27:19,770
That evening five of Gow's men went to Mr
Fea's house.

376
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:25,410
They were carrying weapons, and they threatened
to kill Mr Fea if he did not help them.

377
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:32,000
'Our captain, John Gow, says you must give
us a boat to leave the island, or we'll kill

378
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,669
you this instant!' said one of the men.

379
00:27:34,669 --> 00:27:40,929
'If you want me to help you, you'll have to
be nicer than that,' said Mr Fea.

380
00:27:40,929 --> 00:27:46,110
'Let's go to the tavern for a drink, and we
can discuss things.'

381
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:51,429
Before they left for the tavern, Mr Fea secretly
instructed his servants to sink the boats

382
00:27:51,429 --> 00:27:52,910
they had come in.

383
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:55,520
'These men are very dangerous.

384
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:59,289
They're pirates, and I'm going to arrest them
if I can.

385
00:27:59,289 --> 00:28:04,590
I want you to sink their boats, then come
back to me immediately.'

386
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:09,720
After a while one of his servants arrived
at the tavern and asked to speak to him for

387
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,179
a moment outside.

388
00:28:12,179 --> 00:28:16,710
The servant explained that they had followed
his orders about the pirates' boats.

389
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:22,330
Mr Fea ordered six servants to hide behind
some trees with their weapons.

390
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:27,190
He said that he would walk back that way either
with the ship's officer alone, or with all

391
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:29,340
five pirates.

392
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:33,100
His men must be prepared to attack the pirates
and capture them.

393
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:38,669
Mr Fea went back into the tavern and asked
the officer to come with him to inspect his

394
00:28:38,669 --> 00:28:39,789
boat.

395
00:28:39,789 --> 00:28:44,240
The officer agreed, and they left the tavern
together.

396
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:49,090
When they passed the hedge where Mr Fea's
men were hiding, they ran out and captured

397
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:50,090
the pirate.

398
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:55,130
They tied him up and left one of the six servants
in charge of him.

399
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:59,390
Then Mr Fea and his five remaining servants
went back to the tavern.

400
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:02,540
They ran through the two doors, showing their
weapons.

401
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:03,540
'Surrender!'

402
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:04,980
they shouted.

403
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:09,690
The pirates had no choice, and they too became
prisoners.

404
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:15,200
The next day the wind blew the Revenge onto
the rocks of the island.

405
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:21,279
Gow sent a message to Mr Fea, telling him
that he was offering 1,000 pounds for help

406
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:24,210
in getting the ship away from the island.

407
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:29,250
He also sent a sailor to the island with a
present of a bottle of brandy for Mr Fea.

408
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:35,590
Mr Fea, however, was determined to capture
all the pirates and send them to prison.

409
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:41,659
'I'll give you a boat,' Mr Fea offered, 'but
you'll have to send the ship's carpenter with

410
00:29:41,659 --> 00:29:44,500
two or three men to repair it.'

411
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:49,200
Gow sent the men, and Mr Fea immediately captured
them.

412
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:53,810
Then he sent Gow a message saying that all
the pirates had to come and take the boat,

413
00:29:53,810 --> 00:29:58,559
as his men were working on it and getting
it ready for the pirates' escape.

414
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:03,560
Once again John Gow instructed his crew to
go to the island, and this time he came with

415
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,560
them.

416
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:08,750
Mr Fea's men were able to capture them all.

417
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:14,990
All twenty-eight pirates were sent to Edinburgh,
and then to Marshalsea prison in London, where

418
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:20,070
they found their former partner, the cruel
lieutenant Williams.

419
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:25,390
Twelve of them were condemned to death, including
John Gow, but five of them were found not

420
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:30,020
guilty because they had been forced to join
the rebellion.

421
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:33,490
John Gow's days as a pirate were finally over.

422
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:38,050
He was sent to Newgate prison and tried at
the Old Bailey.

423
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:46,140
A strange thing happened during John Gow's
execution on 11 August 1729.

424
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:51,299
The officials tied the rope around his neck
and pushed him off the cart.

425
00:30:51,299 --> 00:30:55,520
He hung in the air for a moment, struggling
terribly.

426
00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:00,120
Then suddenly the rope broke and he fell to
the ground.

427
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,010
He was in agony.

428
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:05,560
The officials took hold of him and tied the
rope around his neck again.

429
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:10,140
Then they put him back on the cart and pushed
him off once more.

430
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:15,549
This time the rope did not break and in a
few moments the famous pirate was dead.

431
00:31:15,549 --> 00:31:22,549
His body was hung in chains by the River Thames
as a warning to other pirates.

432
00:31:22,549 --> 00:31:25,220
PART THREE

433
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:30,429
Jonatan Wild - Criminal genius

434
00:31:30,429 --> 00:31:32,490
CHAPTER ONE

435
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:35,880
Crime Pays

436
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:40,150
Jonathan Wild was the eighteenth century's
most famous criminal.

437
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:46,890
He was born in Staffordshire in the North
of England in 1682, and when he was fifteen

438
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:54,070
his father sent him to work for a buckle maker
in Birmingham; He worked there for seven years,

439
00:31:54,070 --> 00:32:00,769
and then moved to Wolverhampton where he married
and set up a business on his own.

440
00:32:00,769 --> 00:32:07,549
He and his wife had a son, and for two years
they seemed to live fairly happily together.

441
00:32:07,549 --> 00:32:15,580
Wild, however, found his life in Wolverhampton
too boring, and he decided to move to London,

442
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:18,850
leaving his wife and son behind.

443
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:24,990
Things did not go well for him in the big
city, however, and he soon fell into debt.

444
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:30,740
As he was unable to pay his debts, he was
arrested and sent to prison.

445
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:34,130
He remained a prisoner for more than four
years.

446
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:40,070
Later, when he wrote about his criminal life,
he said that it was the experience of mixing

447
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:46,799
with criminals in Wood Street prison that
made him choose crime as a career.

448
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:52,809
While he was in prison Wild made many friends
among the other prisoners, and formed a relationship

449
00:32:52,809 --> 00:32:56,530
with a woman called Mary Milliner.

450
00:32:56,530 --> 00:33:01,470
When they were released from prison, Wild
and Milliner lived together as husband and

451
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:07,669
wife, and they used her money or their money
from illegal practices to open a tavern in

452
00:33:07,669 --> 00:33:09,659
Cock Alley.

453
00:33:09,659 --> 00:33:15,510
It played an important part in Wild's criminal
career, and became a legendary place in the

454
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:18,600
history of crime.

455
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:24,950
The usual customers of the tavern were criminals,
and they soon found that Wild was a sympathetic

456
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:27,680
and interested listener.

457
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:32,210
They told him about the robberies they had
recently committed, and they revealed their

458
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:35,679
plans for future crimes.

459
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:42,660
This gave Wild enormous power over them: if
Wild told the authorities about the crimes,

460
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:45,169
they might arrest them.

461
00:33:45,169 --> 00:33:50,750
Instead of doing this, however, Wild helped
the criminals by hiding stolen property in

462
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:54,820
his house and selling it for them.

463
00:33:54,820 --> 00:34:00,190
It was not difficult for Wild to sell the
stolen articles because at the time it was

464
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:04,409
not a crime to receive or sell stolen property.

465
00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:11,399
Parliament soon changed the law, however,
and a new crime of receiving stolen property

466
00:34:11,399 --> 00:34:13,940
came into existence.

467
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:20,040
The punishment for this offence was transportation
for fifteen years.

468
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:25,500
Wild was determined to continue his profitable
business with the criminals, but the new law

469
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:31,290
worried him: he did not want to be arrested
for receiving stolen property.

470
00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:35,100
So he invited the criminals to a meeting in
his tavern.

471
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:39,330
'I can't take the goods you steal anymore,'
he explained.

472
00:34:39,330 --> 00:34:42,030
'It's too dangerous.

473
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:45,379
But I have a suggestion that will make us
all rich.'

474
00:34:45,379 --> 00:34:48,820
The criminals were very excited.

475
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:54,339
'You won't make much money if you try to sell
the goods to other receivers of stolen property.

476
00:34:54,339 --> 00:34:59,210
Bring everything to me,' he continued, 'and
I'll arrange to return all the goods to their

477
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:03,410
owners in exchange for some money.'

478
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:10,020
The criminals were pleased with Wild's plan
and they decided to do as he suggested.

479
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:14,960
Wild found several places around London to
keep the stolen goods that the criminals gave

480
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,510
him.

481
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:19,480
The new plan worked very well.

482
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:24,589
When a criminal came to him with an item that
he had stolen, Wild went to the person who

483
00:35:24,589 --> 00:35:25,839
had been robbed.

484
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:32,340
He explained that he had a friend, an honest
trader, who had bought the item and wanted

485
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:37,170
to return it because he guessed that it had
been stolen.

486
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:42,920
Wild suggested that the owner should pay the
honest trader a fee for the goods.

487
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:47,710
Many people were so pleased to have the chance
of getting their property back that they willingly

488
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:53,480
paid half the value of the property as the
fee to Wild's trader friend.

489
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:59,460
This fee, of course, was then divided between
Wild and the criminal.

490
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:04,650
Wild did not receive any money directly from
the owners of the stolen property, who only

491
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:08,220
paid the fee to his non-existent trader.

492
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:13,780
There was no law against this type of business,
and for a considerable time Wild was very

493
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:17,530
successful and became very rich.

494
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:22,070
He even opened an office where people who
had been robbed could come and ask his help

495
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:25,470
in getting their property back.

496
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:30,570
Wild charged everyone who came to the office
a small fee for his advice.

497
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:35,490
He then asked for a full description of the
goods that had been taken, and how much the

498
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:39,010
owners were prepared to pay to recover the
goods.

499
00:36:39,010 --> 00:36:44,430
'All you have to do is describe the stolen
goods and tell me how much you're willing

500
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:50,170
to pay for their recovery, and I'll make investigations
into your case,' Wild told the client.

501
00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:52,500
'I'll do the rest.'

502
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:58,950
The client then returned to Wild's office
to find out how the investigation was proceeding.

503
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:04,410
'Unfortunately, on this occasion I haven't
been able to recover your property,' Wild

504
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:05,410
began.

505
00:37:05,410 --> 00:37:10,010
'I've heard through a contact that the thieves
are determined to sell the property for more

506
00:37:10,010 --> 00:37:13,260
money than you've offered to recover the object.

507
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:19,010
However, if you wanted to offer more money,
maybe they'd reconsider.'

508
00:37:19,010 --> 00:37:23,930
This tactic was so successful that most of
the owners increased their offer for the return

509
00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:26,590
of their goods.

510
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:31,720
Wild's interviews with the victims of crime
allowed him to find out how truthful the thieves

511
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,490
were with him.

512
00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:39,079
The thieves were frightened of Wild's power
over them, and most of them told him the truth

513
00:37:39,079 --> 00:37:42,420
about their crimes.

514
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:47,570
Wild's imagination was now so involved in
the planning of crimes that he even invented

515
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:50,240
some new forms of crime.

516
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:55,520
He realised that there were a lot of articles
that had no real value, except to the owners

517
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,790
themselves.

518
00:37:56,790 --> 00:38:04,330
'The things I want you to steal are books
of accounts, watches and rings,' he told his

519
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:05,330
thieves.

520
00:38:05,330 --> 00:38:10,380
'All of these are personal items that are
important to their owners, and I'm sure they'll

521
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:17,869
pay very high fees in order to recover them.'

522
00:38:17,869 --> 00:38:19,369
CHAPTER TWO

523
00:38:19,369 --> 00:38:23,210
The Thief-taker

524
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:28,190
Wild's reputation with the thieves was by
now firmly established.

525
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:32,830
Nearly all of them were afraid of him and
so they obeyed him.

526
00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:37,780
He always paid them what he had promised,
and they knew that he would always help them

527
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:39,140
if they were arrested.

528
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:46,280
There were some thieves, however, who resented
his power in the criminal world and they refused

529
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:48,320
to work for him.

530
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:53,650
In these cases he used to send for the thief
concerned, with a message guaranteeing the

531
00:38:53,650 --> 00:38:55,720
thief's safety.

532
00:38:55,720 --> 00:39:01,119
He then tried to persuade the thief to change
his attitude and to work for him.

533
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:06,480
If the man refused, he ended the interview
with a sinister threat.

534
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:12,300
'Remember what I told you: you can come here
perfectly safely, and leave here perfectly

535
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:15,650
safely, and I'll keep my promise.

536
00:39:15,650 --> 00:39:20,680
But the next time you see me, you'll see your
worst enemy!'

537
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:25,920
One of the ways that Wild helped his criminal
friends who were unlucky enough to be arrested

538
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:28,220
was very clever.

539
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:33,600
He visited them in prison and suggested that
they could escape punishment if they offered

540
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,980
'evidence'.

541
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:41,230
A criminal who told the court about more important
crimes committed by other people could be

542
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:46,150
given his freedom as a reward for helping
the justice system.

543
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:52,040
The 'evidence' that Wild gave his friends
always concerned criminals who had refused

544
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:54,600
to work for him.

545
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:59,770
He also helped his colleagues when they went
to prison by making sure that witnesses against

546
00:39:59,770 --> 00:40:04,360
them did not appear in court on the day of
the trial.

547
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:11,440
He did this by threatening the witnesses so
that they were too frightened to come to court.

548
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:16,770
If there were no witnesses against the criminals,
the judge had to let them go because there

549
00:40:16,770 --> 00:40:19,180
was no evidence.

550
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:25,300
Jonathan Wild was often asked how it was possible
for him to recover so much stolen property

551
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:29,810
if he was not really working with the thieves
themselves.

552
00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:33,470
His reply to this question was always the
same.

553
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:40,040
'I know many thieves, and when I hear about
a particular crime, I make enquiries about

554
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:41,040
it.

555
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:45,800
I leave a message for the criminals, telling
them that they'll receive the reward if they

556
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:48,970
leave the goods in a certain place.

557
00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:53,450
I also promise them that no questions about
the crime will be asked.

558
00:40:53,450 --> 00:40:59,670
I don't commit a crime myself, because I don't
talk to the thieves personally, and I don't

559
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:04,280
receive the stolen property myself.'

560
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:09,839
Wild was a very dangerous enemy to the criminals
who refused to work for him, as the following

561
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:12,570
story shows.

562
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:19,960
One evening in March 1716, a young gentleman
called Knap and his mother were walking back

563
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:22,540
from the opera together.

564
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:25,310
They were attacked by five men.

565
00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:35,230
His mother shouted out for help, but one of
the five men shot her dead.

566
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:41,450
An account of the terrible murder appeared
in the newspapers and a substantial reward

567
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:45,210
was offered for the discovery of the murderer.

568
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:50,900
Wild read the descriptions of the men in the
paper, and when he recognised who they were,

569
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:55,089
he decided to find them and give them up to
the authorities.

570
00:41:55,089 --> 00:41:59,770
He hoped to be rewarded as a thief-catcher.

571
00:41:59,770 --> 00:42:04,160
Wild heard that some of the gang were drinking
in a tavern.

572
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:09,160
He went to there with his servant Abraham
and found one of the gang members, and took

573
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:11,490
him to prison.

574
00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:18,950
Wild then heard that another enemy, a man
called Aires, was at a tavern in Smithfield.

575
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:23,160
Once again Wild and Abraham went to get him.

576
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:28,990
The man who had been described as Aires was
really Thomas Thurland, a member of the gang

577
00:42:28,990 --> 00:42:31,940
that had killed Knap's mother.

578
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:37,630
Thurland had two pistols but as he was surprised
by the appearance of Abraham and Wild, he

579
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:40,260
had no chance to use them.

580
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:45,510
They took Thurland into custody as well, along
with another member of the gang, a certain

581
00:42:45,510 --> 00:42:50,340
Edward Darvel, who was captured the following
night.

582
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:55,770
Soon afterwards the authorities were looking
for yet another criminal, Isaac Rag, for a

583
00:42:55,770 --> 00:42:56,890
burglary.

584
00:42:56,890 --> 00:43:03,170
Wild and his men found Rag and delivered him
over to the authorities.

585
00:43:03,170 --> 00:43:08,710
Rag tried to save himself by giving 'evidence'
of other crimes and criminals.

586
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:15,060
He told the magistrate about twenty-two other
accomplices and a vast number of crimes.

587
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:19,170
The court accepted him as a witness for the
crown.

588
00:43:19,170 --> 00:43:22,440
The other gang members were tried at the Old
Bailey.

589
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:28,150
The charges included the attack on Mr Knap
and the murder of Mrs Knap.

590
00:43:28,150 --> 00:43:35,330
They were found guilty and all three were
executed at Tyburn on 8 June 1716.

591
00:43:35,330 --> 00:43:41,190
Wild, however, was still determined to find
the remaining member of the gang, Timothy

592
00:43:41,190 --> 00:43:42,190
Dun.

593
00:43:42,190 --> 00:43:48,660
Dun was hiding with his wife at home, but
he became bored and decided to send her to

594
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:53,720
ask Jonathan Wild if he was now safe from
the authorities.

595
00:43:53,720 --> 00:44:00,810
Dun's wife came to Wild's office to talk to
him, but she did not trust him completely.

596
00:44:00,810 --> 00:44:06,380
Afterwards she went home a long, complicated
way to avoid being followed by one of Wild's

597
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:07,960
men.

598
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:13,609
But this is exactly what happened: she was
followed.

599
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:19,950
After finding out where he lived, Wild, Abraham
and two other men went to the house.

600
00:44:19,950 --> 00:44:27,470
Dun tried to escape through a window and Abraham
fired a shot that hit Dun in the arm.

601
00:44:27,470 --> 00:44:36,890
He fell out of the window, then another of
Wild's men shot him in the face.

602
00:44:36,890 --> 00:44:43,349
He was captured and taken to Newgate and executed
at Tyburn soon after.

603
00:44:43,349 --> 00:44:48,400
In this way Jonathan Wild succeeded in capturing
all the members of the gang involved in the

604
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:58,190
murder of Mrs Knap, and removed his enemies
without committing a single murder.

605
00:44:58,190 --> 00:44:59,650
CHAPTER THREE

606
00:44:59,650 --> 00:45:03,180
Stolen Property

607
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:09,310
Wild by now had so much stolen property in
London that he decided to sell some of it.

608
00:45:09,310 --> 00:45:14,550
He bought a ship and transported the goods
to Bruges, Ghent and Brussels.

609
00:45:14,550 --> 00:45:20,790
Here they were sold in exchange for wine,
brandy and other items that were then smuggled

610
00:45:20,790 --> 00:45:23,680
secretly into England.

611
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:30,380
This scheme was Very successful for about
two years until the captain of the boat Johnson,

612
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:33,660
and his assistant had an argument.

613
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:39,920
The assistant told the authorities about Johnson's
illegal activities, and the ship was captured

614
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:43,530
and the captain was arrested in a tavern.

615
00:45:43,530 --> 00:45:47,000
Johnson immediately sent for Jonathan Wild.

616
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:52,140
When he arrived Wild realised that he had
to do something quickly if he wanted to save

617
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:53,980
his friend.

618
00:45:53,980 --> 00:45:59,369
He poured a glass of beer over a large man
who was sitting with some friends.

619
00:45:59,369 --> 00:46:01,680
This made the man very angry.

620
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:06,760
'What did you do that for?' he shouted at
Wild.

621
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:09,710
'You and your friends are cowards!'

622
00:46:09,710 --> 00:46:11,160
Wild shouted back.

623
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:15,070
'Come outside and fight me - all of you!'

624
00:46:15,070 --> 00:46:18,040
The man and his friends stood up.

625
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:23,950
One of them threw a chair at Wild but it missed
him, and hit another group of men who were

626
00:46:23,950 --> 00:46:25,580
sitting at a table.

627
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:30,530
They stood up as well and everyone began fighting.

628
00:46:30,530 --> 00:46:35,120
'Now's your chance,' Wild whispered urgently
to Johnson.

629
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:36,800
'Get out now!'

630
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:44,800
Johnson took Wild's advice and ran out of
the tavern as fast as he could.

631
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:47,590
The officers reacted too slowly.

632
00:46:47,590 --> 00:46:52,920
They saw their prisoner escape, but they could
not do anything about it.

633
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:58,619
They knew, however, that Jonathan Wild was
responsible for the riot and they wanted their

634
00:46:58,619 --> 00:47:02,599
revenge for what he had done.

635
00:47:02,599 --> 00:47:08,300
The authorities began searching for Jonathan
Wild, and a number of charges were prepared

636
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:10,280
against him.

637
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:14,810
His good luck was about to come to an end.

638
00:47:14,810 --> 00:47:21,860
Mr Jones, the high constable of Holborn, issued
a warrant for the arrest of Wild.

639
00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:26,950
When the authorities discovered where he was,
they arrested him and took him to Newgate

640
00:47:26,950 --> 00:47:28,960
prison.

641
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:35,089
Mr Jones produced a long list of crimes that
he said Jonathan Wild had committed, including

642
00:47:35,089 --> 00:47:39,400
two crimes which were punishable by death.

643
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:47,270
On 15 May 1725 Wild was tried for the theft
of fifty yards of lace from the house of Mrs

644
00:47:47,270 --> 00:47:48,460
Streatham.

645
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:54,610
During the trial it emerged that Jonathan
Wild had organised the theft of the lace,

646
00:47:54,610 --> 00:48:00,309
but that he had not gone into the house himself:
he had sent his men into the house to steal

647
00:48:00,309 --> 00:48:02,460
the lace.

648
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:07,260
They had delivered it to him in the street
outside the house.

649
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:11,880
Wild's defence lawyer argued that Wild was
not guilty of the offence.

650
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:19,450
'The charge explicitly states that my client
stole the lace in the house,' the lawyer argued.

651
00:48:19,450 --> 00:48:25,260
'But the evidence shows that Mr Wild didn't
steal the lace in the house because he was

652
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:27,880
outside in the street.

653
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:31,369
Therefore my client isn't guilty of the crime.'

654
00:48:31,369 --> 00:48:34,510
'You're right,' the judge agreed.

655
00:48:34,510 --> 00:48:38,430
'The charge against your client isn't accurate.'

656
00:48:38,430 --> 00:48:46,839
The jury listened to the judge's words carefully
and they found Jonathan Wild not guilty of

657
00:48:46,839 --> 00:48:48,720
the crime.

658
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:51,360
Parliament now passed a new law.

659
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:56,640
The new law said that if people had secret
dealings with criminals, and took money for

660
00:48:56,640 --> 00:49:01,920
recovering stolen property from their criminal
contacts, they should be treated as if they

661
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:04,280
had committed the crimes themselves.

662
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:10,829
The second charge brought against Jonathan
Wild was based on this new law.

663
00:49:10,829 --> 00:49:16,970
It concerned the same crime as before, the
theft of the lace from Mrs Streatham.

664
00:49:16,970 --> 00:49:22,599
She gave evidence that after the lace was
stolen, she went to Wild's office to ask for

665
00:49:22,599 --> 00:49:25,150
his help in recovering it.

666
00:49:25,150 --> 00:49:29,220
He told her that he would investigate the
crime for her.

667
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:34,420
She said that she would be prepared to pay
twenty-five guineas for the recovery of her

668
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:35,540
property.

669
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:41,760
Shortly afterwards Jonathan Wild was arrested
and imprisoned in Newgate.

670
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:45,500
Mrs Streatham said that Wild wrote to her
from prison.

671
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:51,400
'Bring me ten guineas, and your property will
be returned to you,' he wrote.

672
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:56,790
She went to the prison to see Wild and found
another man with him.

673
00:49:56,790 --> 00:50:00,250
Wild told her to give the other man the ten
guineas.

674
00:50:00,250 --> 00:50:02,990
She gave him the money and he left.

675
00:50:02,990 --> 00:50:08,170
He returned soon afterwards with a box containing
the stolen lace.

676
00:50:08,170 --> 00:50:14,210
The judge decided that the new law applied
to Jonathan Wild.

677
00:50:14,210 --> 00:50:19,400
He said that it was clear that Wild had secret
dealings with thieves and that he took money

678
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:23,400
for returning stolen property to its owners.

679
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:30,650
The jury found Jonathan Wild guilty of the
crime, and he was condemned to death.

680
00:50:30,650 --> 00:50:36,099
Wild tried to escape the consequences of his
crimes by arguing that he had done society

681
00:50:36,099 --> 00:50:42,800
a service by returning stolen property to
the people from whom it had been taken.

682
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:48,559
He wanted some of the important and influential
people who had paid him for his services to

683
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:52,440
organise a royal pardon for him.

684
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:59,820
These hopes, however, were in vain; it was
clear that there was no hope for Wild.

685
00:50:59,820 --> 00:51:05,700
He became desperate and tried to poison himself
before the day of the execution, but he did

686
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:08,319
not succeed.

687
00:51:08,319 --> 00:51:16,069
Jonathan Wild was taken to Tyburn to be executed
on 24 May 1725.

688
00:51:16,069 --> 00:51:23,530
His notoriety as a criminal was so great that
people threw stones at him on his last journey.

689
00:51:23,530 --> 00:51:28,390
The executioner told him that he could have
a reasonable period to prepare himself for

690
00:51:28,390 --> 00:51:31,020
the execution.

691
00:51:31,020 --> 00:51:36,380
Jonathan Wild sat in the prison cart for a
considerable time.

692
00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:39,680
This made the crowd frustrated and angry.

693
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:41,460
'Hang him!'

694
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:43,650
they shouted at the executioner.

695
00:51:43,650 --> 00:51:46,990
'Hang him now, or we'll hang you!'

696
00:51:46,990 --> 00:51:53,220
The executioner was afraid and performed his
duty immediately, and the career of one of

697
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:58,600
the most successful eighteenth-century criminals
came to an end.

698
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:01,359
PART FOUR

699
00:52:01,359 --> 00:52:08,760
Richard 'Dick' Turpin - Gentleman, Highwayman
and horse thief

700
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:10,260
CHAPTER ONE

701
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:11,260
The Essex Gang

702
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:19,950
Richard Turpin, more commonly known as Dick
Turpin, was the son of an Essex farmer.

703
00:52:19,950 --> 00:52:26,940
He was brutal and cruel even as a young man,
and he seemed destined for a life of crime.

704
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:32,550
Turpin eventually became a butcher, and he
married soon afterwards.

705
00:52:32,550 --> 00:52:38,960
He began stealing his neighbours' farm animals,
which he used to sell in his shop.

706
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:45,320
His crimes were discovered and an order for
his arrest was prepared, but he ran away before

707
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:52,860
the authorities came to his house and joined
a gang of smugglers in another part of Essex.

708
00:52:52,860 --> 00:52:57,520
The gang then moved to London, where they
robbed people's houses.

709
00:52:57,520 --> 00:53:01,890
Their strategy worked like this.

710
00:53:01,890 --> 00:53:07,440
One of the gang used to knock on the door
of a house, and when someone opened it, the

711
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:12,250
rest of the gang ran in and stole what they
could find.

712
00:53:12,250 --> 00:53:16,760
Their first victim was an old man who had
a shop.

713
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:21,510
They robbed him but they were not violent
with him.

714
00:53:21,510 --> 00:53:27,280
They carried out a series of such robberies,
and Dick Turpin was increasingly cruel to

715
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:29,610
his victims.

716
00:53:29,610 --> 00:53:36,380
He held one old woman over a fire until she
told the gang where her money was hidden.

717
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:45,500
On 11 January 1735 the gang robbed a rich
farmer, Mr Saunders, in Kent.

718
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:51,210
They rushed into his house, where they found
Mr Saunders with his wife and friends playing

719
00:53:51,210 --> 00:53:52,710
cards.

720
00:53:52,710 --> 00:53:54,750
'Everybody stay very quiet!'

721
00:53:54,750 --> 00:53:56,150
Turpin ordered.

722
00:53:56,150 --> 00:54:01,150
'If you do what we tell you, no one will be
hurt.'

723
00:54:01,150 --> 00:54:05,920
Mr Saunders and the rest of the people in
the house quickly gave the gang their money

724
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:08,069
and valuable possessions.

725
00:54:08,069 --> 00:54:13,450
Their house robberies continued in this way
for a considerable time.

726
00:54:13,450 --> 00:54:22,010
Then, on 4 February 1735, they decided to
rob a certain Mr Lawrence, who lived in Edgware.

727
00:54:22,010 --> 00:54:26,599
The gang arrived at the house just as Mr Lawrence
was going in.

728
00:54:26,599 --> 00:54:32,960
They took hold of him and told him to instruct
the servant boy to open the front door of

729
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:34,890
the house.

730
00:54:34,890 --> 00:54:39,319
The boy was so frightened that he did nothing.

731
00:54:39,319 --> 00:54:44,859
Another servant opened the door, imagining
that nothing was wrong, and the gang rushed

732
00:54:44,859 --> 00:54:47,869
in with their prisoner, Mr Lawrence.

733
00:54:47,869 --> 00:54:53,460
They looked through the house for items of
value, but were not satisfied with what they

734
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:55,020
found.

735
00:54:55,020 --> 00:54:59,770
They said they would murder Mr Lawrence if
he did not tell them where his valuable possessions

736
00:54:59,770 --> 00:55:02,020
were hidden.

737
00:55:02,020 --> 00:55:08,580
Finally, one of the gang treated a female
servant very cruelly, and they left the house,

738
00:55:08,580 --> 00:55:12,290
leaving everyone there tied up.

739
00:55:12,290 --> 00:55:18,700
The authorities offered a reward of 50 pounds
for information about the gang, but this produced

740
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:20,299
no results.

741
00:55:20,299 --> 00:55:28,049
They continued as before, entering houses
and threatening and robbing the owners.

742
00:55:28,049 --> 00:55:32,430
One day they robbed another farmer, Mr Francis.

743
00:55:32,430 --> 00:55:37,349
They found two of Mr Francis' servants working
outside the house.

744
00:55:37,349 --> 00:55:39,970
They captured them and tied them up.

745
00:55:39,970 --> 00:55:46,530
When they went to the house and discovered
that Mr Francis was just about to go in himself,

746
00:55:46,530 --> 00:55:51,510
they captured him as well and tied him up
together with his two servants.

747
00:55:51,510 --> 00:55:57,400
Then they rushed into the house where they
found Mrs Francis, her daughter, and a female

748
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:58,400
servant.

749
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:04,250
They attacked the three women very violently
before leaving the house with all the valuables

750
00:56:04,250 --> 00:56:06,859
they could find.

751
00:56:06,859 --> 00:56:12,660
The authorities now increased the reward to
100 pounds for information about the members

752
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:14,940
of the gang.

753
00:56:14,940 --> 00:56:21,730
As a result of this, two gang members were
arrested and hanged, and the remaining members

754
00:56:21,730 --> 00:56:26,559
decided that it was now too dangerous to continue
working together.

755
00:56:26,559 --> 00:56:33,660
Dick Turpin realised that it was too dangerous
to remain in the area and he escaped to the

756
00:56:33,660 --> 00:56:35,569
country.

757
00:56:35,569 --> 00:56:42,820
It was time to change his career; he had decided
to become a highwayman.

758
00:56:42,820 --> 00:56:46,560
CHAPTER TWO

759
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:51,410
King and Horses

760
00:56:51,410 --> 00:56:56,770
One day Turpin was riding towards Cambridge
when he saw another traveller ahead of him

761
00:56:56,770 --> 00:56:58,859
on the road.

762
00:56:58,859 --> 00:57:02,859
He seemed like a rich man, and Turpin decided
to rob him.

763
00:57:02,859 --> 00:57:11,110
He rode up to him and took out two pistols,
pointed them at him and demanded his money.

764
00:57:11,110 --> 00:57:18,200
The other traveller was himself a highwayman,
King, who recognised Turpin immediately.

765
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:21,690
King laughed at Turpin's demand for money.

766
00:57:21,690 --> 00:57:25,589
'What,' he asked him, 'dog eat dog?

767
00:57:25,589 --> 00:57:29,589
I know who you are, Richard Turpin.'

768
00:57:29,589 --> 00:57:31,089
Turpin smiled.

769
00:57:31,089 --> 00:57:34,170
He wanted to know what King was going to say
next.

770
00:57:34,170 --> 00:57:37,540
'We should work together,' King told him.

771
00:57:37,540 --> 00:57:39,630
'We could be partners.

772
00:57:39,630 --> 00:57:41,250
What do you think?'

773
00:57:41,250 --> 00:57:43,410
'All right,' Turpin agreed.

774
00:57:43,410 --> 00:57:46,950
'Maybe a partnership isn't such a bad idea.

775
00:57:46,950 --> 00:57:49,299
Let's try it.'

776
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:55,180
The two men began a series of highway robberies,
and they became known in and outside London

777
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:57,369
for their exploits.

778
00:57:57,369 --> 00:58:02,230
On one occasion, they robbed a gentleman on
the road and then allowed him to buy back

779
00:58:02,230 --> 00:58:04,410
the watch they had just taken.

780
00:58:04,410 --> 00:58:10,049
Turpin was also known to be a gentleman to
the ladies he and King robbed, and if they

781
00:58:10,049 --> 00:58:15,609
were young and beautiful, he complimented
them on their beauty when he took their possessions,

782
00:58:15,609 --> 00:58:16,609
saying:

783
00:58:16,609 --> 00:58:20,910
'It's a pity to take things from such beautiful
ladies.'

784
00:58:20,910 --> 00:58:27,040
King and Turpin made a hiding-place for themselves
in Epping Forest, where they could sleep and

785
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:29,599
keep their horses.

786
00:58:29,599 --> 00:58:32,220
One day disaster struck for Turpin.

787
00:58:32,220 --> 00:58:38,810
A certain Mr Thompson, who worked in Epping
Forest, had seen the hiding-place, and he

788
00:58:38,810 --> 00:58:42,339
guessed who the two mysterious men were.

789
00:58:42,339 --> 00:58:48,010
When he heard that the authorities were offering
a reward of 100 pounds for information about

790
00:58:48,010 --> 00:58:52,619
Turpin and King, he decided to arrest them.

791
00:58:52,619 --> 00:58:56,400
Mr Thompson approached their hiding-place
with a friend.

792
00:58:56,400 --> 00:59:00,049
Turpin saw them coming and went out to meet
them.

793
00:59:00,049 --> 00:59:01,450
He thought they were poachers.

794
00:59:01,450 --> 00:59:06,440
'There aren't any rabbits near here,' he told
them.

795
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:11,109
'That's true,' Mr Thompson's friend replied,
'but there's a Turpin.'

796
00:59:11,109 --> 00:59:14,630
He pointed his gun at Turpin and told him
to surrender.

797
00:59:14,630 --> 00:59:19,130
'Very well, gentlemen,' Turpin replied in
a friendly way.

798
00:59:19,130 --> 00:59:21,220
'There's no chance for me.

799
00:59:21,220 --> 00:59:22,960
I surrender.'

800
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:28,480
As he was talking, however, Turpin began to
walk backwards very slowly.

801
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:36,380
Then he quickly reached down, picked up his
own gun and shot Mr Thompson's friend.

802
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:39,670
Mr Thompson ran away into the forest.

803
00:59:39,670 --> 00:59:44,660
He told the authorities about the murder,
and they issued a reward of 200 pounds for

804
00:59:44,660 --> 00:59:47,069
the arrest of Richard Turpin.

805
00:59:47,069 --> 00:59:51,940
Turpin and King now decided to work separately.

806
00:59:51,940 --> 00:59:59,049
Turpin decided that Epping Forest was a dangerous
place, and he left the area.

807
00:59:59,049 --> 01:00:03,359
He sent a message to his wife to meet him
in a tavern.

808
01:00:03,359 --> 01:00:07,670
When he arrived at the tavern he saw a butcher
there.

809
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:13,829
This man knew who he was, and he remembered
that Dick Turpin owed him five pounds.

810
01:00:13,829 --> 01:00:20,619
'Now, Dick,' he said, 'I know you've got a
lot of money these days.

811
01:00:20,619 --> 01:00:22,880
Give me the five pounds you owe me.'

812
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:29,220
'My wife is in the next room,' Turpin told
the butcher 'She'll give you the money.'

813
01:00:29,220 --> 01:00:34,990
The butcher now began telling the other people
in the tavern who Dick Turpin was.

814
01:00:34,990 --> 01:00:41,450
He said that they should arrest him Turpin
escaped through a window and rode away.

815
01:00:41,450 --> 01:00:48,090
Turpin and King joined up again, and they
took a third partner into their business,

816
01:00:48,090 --> 01:00:50,890
a man called Potter.

817
01:00:50,890 --> 01:00:57,040
One day, riding towards London, Turpin's horse
was tired and when he saw another traveller

818
01:00:57,040 --> 01:01:01,040
on the road, he decided to take his horse.

819
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:07,309
The owner of the horse was called Mr Major,
and the theft took place in Epping Forest

820
01:01:07,309 --> 01:01:11,819
near a tavern called The Green Man.

821
01:01:11,819 --> 01:01:17,980
Mr Major immediately told the landlord of
The Green Man about the theft of his horse.

822
01:01:17,980 --> 01:01:23,430
He also advertised for information about the
thieves and his horse.

823
01:01:23,430 --> 01:01:29,040
The landlord of The Green Man soon received
information that a horse very similar to the

824
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:36,820
one that had been stolen could be found at
the Red Lion tavern in Whitechapel, London.

825
01:01:36,820 --> 01:01:41,650
The landlord of The Green Man went to the
tavern and waited to see if someone arrived

826
01:01:41,650 --> 01:01:44,490
to collect the horse.

827
01:01:44,490 --> 01:01:50,060
When King's brother arrived at the tavern
he was immediately arrested.

828
01:01:50,060 --> 01:01:56,420
At first he said that the horse belonged to
him, but it was soon proved that he was lying,

829
01:01:56,420 --> 01:02:02,589
as the whip he carried in his hand had the
name 'Major' written on it.

830
01:02:02,589 --> 01:02:07,670
The landlord then told King's brother that
he would only be freed if he told them where

831
01:02:07,670 --> 01:02:10,150
his employers were.

832
01:02:10,150 --> 01:02:14,850
He said that a man was waiting for the horse
in Red Lion Street.

833
01:02:14,850 --> 01:02:19,930
The landlord of The Green Man and his friends
went there and saw the man that had been described

834
01:02:19,930 --> 01:02:20,930
to them.

835
01:02:20,930 --> 01:02:27,030
The man, who was Turpin's partner, King, saw
the crowd of people coming towards him and

836
01:02:27,030 --> 01:02:29,210
took out his pistol.

837
01:02:29,210 --> 01:02:32,910
He tried to fire at the crowd but his pistol
did not work.

838
01:02:32,910 --> 01:02:35,760
He called out desperately to Turpin.

839
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:39,270
'Fire, Dick, fire or they'll take us!'

840
01:02:39,270 --> 01:02:44,370
Turpin fired his pistol but the bullet hit
King.

841
01:02:44,370 --> 01:02:49,540
'You've killed me, Dick,' King cried out to
him.

842
01:02:49,540 --> 01:02:53,859
Turpin rode away as fast as he could from
the scene.

843
01:02:53,859 --> 01:02:59,349
King lived for a week after being shot by
Turpin, and he gave the authorities information

844
01:02:59,349 --> 01:03:03,160
about where they might be able to find Turpin
himself.

845
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:09,000
Turpin knew now that the authorities were
looking for him everywhere, and he rode from

846
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,109
one place to another.

847
01:03:11,109 --> 01:03:17,450
First he went to the east, to Lincolnshire,
where he stole some horses.

848
01:03:17,450 --> 01:03:22,690
He was caught and arrested but managed to
escape.

849
01:03:22,690 --> 01:03:28,099
Next he went further north to Yorkshire, where
he used another name.

850
01:03:28,099 --> 01:03:34,150
He pretended to be a gentleman, and frequently
went hunting with the upper classes.

851
01:03:34,150 --> 01:03:40,240
He supported himself by stealing horses in
Lincolnshire and selling them in Yorkshire.

852
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:46,960
Turpin then made a very small mistake that
cost him his life.

853
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:52,470
When he was out hunting with his friends one
day, he shot a cockerel that belonged to his

854
01:03:52,470 --> 01:03:54,980
landlord.

855
01:03:54,980 --> 01:04:00,569
One of the huntsmen, Mr Hall, told him that
he had made a mistake to shoot the cockerel.

856
01:04:00,569 --> 01:04:07,700
'If you stay here,' Turpin replied coldly,
'I'll shoot you as well.'

857
01:04:07,700 --> 01:04:11,330
Mr Hall was very angry at Turpin's behaviour.

858
01:04:11,330 --> 01:04:17,480
He told the landlord what Turpin had done,
and the authorities arrested him.

859
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:22,110
The magistrates began to collect information
about this mysterious man who had appeared

860
01:04:22,110 --> 01:04:23,180
among them.

861
01:04:23,180 --> 01:04:28,550
They learned that he travelled frequently
to Lincolnshire and always came back with

862
01:04:28,550 --> 01:04:30,270
money and horses.

863
01:04:30,270 --> 01:04:35,030
They began to suspect that he was a highwayman.

864
01:04:35,030 --> 01:04:42,220
Turpin insisted that his real name was Palmer,
and that he had been a butcher in Lincolnshire.

865
01:04:42,220 --> 01:04:47,570
He said that he had lost his business and
had decided to come and live in Yorkshire.

866
01:04:47,570 --> 01:04:51,630
The magistrates made enquiries and discovered
that there had been a butcher in Lincolnshire

867
01:04:51,630 --> 01:04:53,569
called Palmer.

868
01:04:53,569 --> 01:04:57,859
This man was a sheep thief who had escaped
from the authorities there, who were looking

869
01:04:57,859 --> 01:05:00,030
for him.

870
01:05:00,030 --> 01:05:05,299
When he had been in prison in York Castle
for about four months, Turpin wrote a letter

871
01:05:05,299 --> 01:05:08,160
to his brother in Essex.

872
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:12,160
He signed the letter 'John Palmer'.

873
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:17,400
He asked his brother to help him, but his
brother did not read the letter.

874
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:21,500
He did not want to pay the postage for receiving
it.

875
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:26,349
The letter was then sent back to the post
office in Essex.

876
01:05:26,349 --> 01:05:32,060
By chance, the schoolmaster in Essex who had
taught Dick Turpin saw the letter in the post

877
01:05:32,060 --> 01:05:33,060
office.

878
01:05:33,060 --> 01:05:38,059
He recognised his old pupil's writing immediately.

879
01:05:38,059 --> 01:05:42,550
He took the letter to the magistrate and explained
that the writer of the letter was not John

880
01:05:42,550 --> 01:05:45,420
Palmer but Richard Turpin.

881
01:05:45,420 --> 01:05:51,089
Turpin was now tried and sentenced to death
for his crimes.

882
01:05:51,089 --> 01:05:55,950
He behaved very cheerfully after receiving
his sentence and joked about the execution

883
01:05:55,950 --> 01:05:58,010
ahead of him.

884
01:05:58,010 --> 01:06:02,970
He bought some fine clothes shortly before
the day of the execution.

885
01:06:02,970 --> 01:06:10,910
He also paid five poor men to be his mourners
and to follow the cart taking him to the execution.

886
01:06:10,910 --> 01:06:18,180
He behaved with great courage on the day of
the execution, 10 April 1739.

887
01:06:18,180 --> 01:06:23,160
He waved at the crowd who had come to see
him die and he spoke for half an hour with

888
01:06:23,160 --> 01:06:27,369
the executioner before throwing himself down
from the execution ladder.

889
01:06:27,369 --> 01:06:32,259
The career of the famous highwayman had come
to an end at last.

890
01:06:32,259 --> 01:06:32,569
- THE END -
